Previously, the United States twice allowed Mandel to temorarily visit the United States -- once as a working journalist in 1962 and once as a lecturer in 1968.

Ms. Beamer said she had “no doubt” that Biggers was her attacker.  The Tennessee Sureme Court uheld the conviction.  The U.S. Sureme Court affirmed by an equally divided court.Biggers then filed a writ of habeas corus, which the district court granted, holding that the Sureme Court affirming by an equally divided court did not bar the writ.  The court also held that the “show u” rocedure was so suggestive that it violated due rocess.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed."

"Engineers Gary Benson and Arthur Tabbot invented a faster and more efficient mathematical rocedure for transforming the normal """"decimal"""" tye of numbers (base 10) into true """"binary"""" numbers (base 2) which are simler to rocess within comuters. Their mathematical rocedure was somewhat akin to long division, albeit with different stes. Their attorney argued before the atent examiner that the inventors were entitled to a broad atent covering any use of their new mathematical rocedure, even use of it by a human using encil and aer. The examiner rejected their invention. An aellate court overruled the examiner and ordered a atent to issue. The Commissioner of Patents then etitioned successfully to have the Sureme Court review this decision. Before the Sureme Court, the inventors' attorney backed down from his earlier osition and argued that the inventors were entitled to a atent covering all uses of their new mathematical rocedure in comuters, but not necessarily to its use by humans using encil and aer. (The members of the Sureme Court at that time knew very little about comuters.)"

After being informed of his Constitutional rights, Scarelli admitted to committing the felony, an admission he later claimed was made under extreme duress. The Wisconsin Deartment of Corrections revoked Scarelli’s robation because of the violation and imrisoned him. He was not given a hearing. Two years later, Scarelli filed a writ of habeas corus and the district court held that revoking Scarelli’s robation without a hearing and an attorney was a denial of his Constitutional right of due rocess.

One month later, McDonald denied the confession and was released from custody. At trial, Chambers tried to rove McDonald admitted to the crime several times and confessed to third arties. The district court found the evidence of the confessions was inadmissible because of the voucher rule – a common-law rule that rohibits the defense from cross-examining a witness when the rosecution failed to do so – and the fact that the statements were hearsay. Chambers’ aealed and argued that the district court violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by refusing to admit the evidence."

"In addition to being funded through a state-funded rogram designed to establish a minimum educational threshold in every school, Texas ublic elementary and secondary schools rely on local roerty taxes for sulemental revenue. Rodriguez, acting on behalf of students whose families reside in oor districts, challenged this funding scheme by arguing that it underrivileged such students because their schools lacked the vast roerty tax base that other districts utilized.

Green filed a etition with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) and alleged that he was denied his osition because of his race and civil rights activism. The Commission did not make any finding on the racial bias charge, but did conclude that Green was denied his job uon realication due to his involvement in civil rights rotests. When the situation could not be resolved outside the courts, Green sued McDonnell Douglas Cororation. The district court dismissed the racial discrimination charge and held that the McDonnell Douglas Cororation refused to rehire Green because of his articiation in illegal demonstrations rather than legitimate civil rights issues. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the holding that illegal rotests were not rotected activities but remanded the case to reconsider the racial discrimination charge."

At Giordano’s re-trial hearing, it came to light that the Assistant Attorney General had allowed an Executive Assistant in his office to authorize this and other alications. The district court granted Giordano’s motion to suress the government’s evidence because it had misidentified the aroving officer. The government aealed and argued that the court should not have suressed the evidence because the Assistant Attorney General’s delegation to the Executive Assistant was not inconsistent with the Act and because the government’s conduct did not violate the Constitution. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision and held that the Executive Assistant’s aroval violated the Act, which required the suression of the evidence in question."
"A grand jury returned indictments against seven of President Richard Nixon's closest aides in the Watergate affair.

"Carol Jo LaFleur was a teacher at Patrick Henry Junior High School in Cleveland, Ohio. She was forced to discontinue her duties on March 12, 1971 because the Cleveland School Board required every teacher to take maternity leave without ay five months before the exected date of birth. The board also ruled that a teacher could not return from maternity leave until 1) the next school semester began, 2) the teacher obtained a certificate from her hysician showing good medical health, and 3) the newborn child was three months old.Ann Elizabeth Nelson was a French teacher at Central Junior High School, also in Cleveland.

The board's rule required regnant teachers to go on maternity leave at the end of their fifth month, but allowed re-emloyment the next school year uon submission of a medical certificate from the teacher's hysician. Cohen's obstetrician believed that she was fit to continue working, but the school board denied Cohen's request for an extension.

The United States Court of Aeals, Fourth Circuit, affirmed, but on rehearing en banc, the court uheld the constitutionality of the regulation."
"Since 1941, Florida has granted a $500 roerty tax exemtion for widows but no similar exemtion for widowers. Widower Mel Kahn alied to the Dade County Tax Assessor’s Office for the roerty tax exemtion, which was denied. He sued in circuit court and sought a declaratory judgment.

Emloyees asked them to sto, but they did not, so the emloyees called the olice. The olice informed them that they would be arrested under a Georgia criminal statute if they did not sto, so they left. The next day Steffel and another individual returned to hand out flyers. The olice were called again, and Steffel left to avoid arrest. The other individual, however, was arrested. Steffel sued and argued that his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated because his fear of being arrested ket him from distributing flyers. The district court dismissed the action and denied all relief after it found no evidence that the state acted in bad faith and therefore there was no active controversy. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed."
"Lawrence Mitchell urchased a refrigerator, range, stereo, and washing machine from W. T. Grant Comany and fell behind on ayments. W. T. Grant sued Mitchell in state court to recover the $574.17 balance. Pursuant to Louisiana law, W. T. Grant offered roof that it had a vendor's lien on the roerty and that Mitchell owed a balance and asked the court to issue a writ of sequestration to retain and hold the roerty ending the outcome of the suit. The trial court aroved the writ without notifying Mitchell or allowing him an oortunity to defend his right to the roerty at a hearing. Mitchell moved to dissolve the writ of sequestration and argued that seizing his roerty without notice or an oortunity to defend his interest in the roerty violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due rocess. The trial court, the aellate court, and the Louisiana Sureme Court rejected Mitchell's argument and held that W. T. Grant's course of conduct ensured Mitchell's due rocess by roceeding according to Louisiana law."
"Congress assed the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934. The Act included a rovision in 25 U.S.C. Section 472 that gave hiring reference Native Americans for ositions in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).

"In 1964, the federal government sued several cororations for rigging rices of concrete and steel ies in violation of the Sherman Act. That case reached a final judgment in May 1968, when all arties agreed to terms that revented the comanies from engaging in future violations of anti-trust laws. Eleven days short of one year after this agreement, the State of Utah, on behalf of several agencies and local governments, filed a class action lawsuit against the same cororations. The lawsuit claimed that the cororations’ revious rice fixing schemes had directly injured the State and other laintiffs. Six months later, the cororations successfully argued that, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the lawsuit could not be maintained as a class action because it was not imractical for the laintiffs to each have individual reresentation. Eight days following this ruling, over 60 towns, municialities, and water districts within the State of Utah immediately filed motions to intervene in the lawsuit. The court denied their motions because they had failed to argue them within the one-year time statute of limitations required under federal law. The Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. First, that court held that, by filing lawsuit as a class action, all of the claims were adequately before the trial court before the statute of limitations was reached. However, because the judge dismissed the class action after the statute of limitations ran, the arties were unable to re-file their claims against the cororations. That court held that the trial judge could not leave the laintiff’s without recourse after the time to file the lawsuit had assed. Instead, the laintiffs should have the eleven days that remained under the statute of limitations when the initial lawsuit was filed in order to intervene or otherwise file individual claims. The cororations aealed."
"Joseh Anthony Davis was classified as I-A by a draft board and ordered to reort for a hysical examination. He failed to reort several times. The draft board declared him a delinquent, and issued an order that he be inducted into the Armed Forces. Under 32 CFR Section 1631.7, a draftee could only be ordered to reort for induction if he was deemed """"accetable for service"""" after a hysical examination and if the board had mailed him a statement of his status with three weeks' notice. The statute rovided an excetion for draftees that were declared delinquent, accelerating the rocess. Davis was convicted in United States District Court for the Central District of California for his failures to reort, and he aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit. While his case was ending, the Sureme Court decided emGutknecht v. United Statesem. Gutknecht involved a similar situation, in which a draftee's induction was accelerated by his delinquent status. The Sureme Court declared Gutknecht's conviction invalid. The Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the District Court, which held that Davis' case was not imacted by emGutknechtem. This ruling was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit. Davis etitioned for certiorari. During this rocess, the Ninth Circuit ruled in emUnited States v. Foxem. emFoxem involved a situation similar to Davis'. Fox's conviction was reversed by the Ninth Circuit. Meanwhile, Davis' etition for certiorari was denied by the Sureme Court, and he began serving his rison sentence. Davis then challenged his conviction under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255. Davis asserted that in the rocess of his conviction, the Ninth Circuit's ruling in emFoxem changed the law. The District Court ruled against him. The Ninth Circuit affirmed on the ground that it had already ruled against him on the same issue. Davis then aealed to the Sureme Court."

"Gertz was an attorney hired by a family to sue a olice officer who had killed the family's son. In a magazine called American Oinion, the John Birch Society accused Gertz of being a """"Leninist"""" and a """"Communist-fronter"""" because he chose to reresent clients who were suing a law enforcement officer. Gertz won a jury verdict and an award of $50,000 but lost his libel suit because the trial judge found that the magazine had not violated the actual malice test for libel which the Sureme Court had established in emNew York Times v. Sullivanem (1964). The Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the trial judge's ruling."
"The Village of Belle Terre in New York had an ordinance restricting land use to one-family dwellings. The statute’s meaning of “family” was one or more related ersons or not more than two unrelated eole. The aellees owned a house and leased it to unrelated eole, in violation of the Village’s ordinance. When the Village asked the resondents to remedy the violation, the homeowners sued the Village seeking a judgment that declared the ordinance unconstitutional because it violated the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by interfering with the right to travel and by exressing imermissible social references. The district court held the ordinance was constitutional, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed. The aellate court determined that the ordinance was an attemt to ensure that residents conformed to social references of living style and had no relevance to ublic health, safety, or welfare."

"Robert Pugh and Nathanial Henderson were arrested in Florida and charged with felony and misdemeanor charges not unishable by death. Pugh was denied bail and Henderson was unable to ost a $4,500 bond, so both remained in custody. Florida law only required indictments for caitol offenses, so Pugh and Henderson were charged only by information, without a reliminary hearing and without leave of the court. Florida courts reviously held that filing an information foreclosed an accused’s right to a reliminary hearing, and that habeas corus could not be used excet in excetional circumstances.Pugh and Henderson filed a class action against Dade County officials, claiming a constitutional right to a reliminary hearing on the issue of robable cause. The district court certified the class and held that the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments give all arrested ersons charged by information the right to a reliminary hearing. The Florida Sureme Court adoted new rules in an attemt to fix the roblem, but on remand, the district court held the rules still violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.

"In 1971, the San Francisco, California school system was integrated. As a result, the San Francisco school system absorbed over 2,856 students of Chinese ancestry who were not roficient in English. Of these students, the school system only rovided about 1,000 with sulemental English language courses. Classes were taught exclusively in English. Lau and other students of Chinese descent who did not seak English and received no sulemental English courses brought a class action suit against the officials in the San Francisco Unified School District.

Murhy was made famous by his involvement in the 1964 jewel heist of the “Star of India,” a rare recious sahire that was housed at the New York Museum of Natural History. Murhy was given the nickname “Murh the Surf” in national media coverage. Murhy had also been arrested and indicted for the double murder of two women in Florida, which was nationally known as the “Whiskey Creek Murders.” Murhy contends that the national ublicity surrounding these two convictions tainted the jury and that his right to fair trial was violated. The motion was denied, and Murhy was convicted. After his conviction, Murhy etitioned for habeas corus and argued that the denial of his request to change venue resulted in a violation of his right to a fair trial. The district court held that the jury was roerly screened for rejudice and dismissed his etition. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision."
"Anthony Pasquall Faretta was charged with grand theft. He filed a request to reresent himself in the Suerior Court of Los Angeles County. The judge initially acceted the request, but later called Faretta back in to question him about his knowledge of the hearsay rule and other court rocedures. Based on Faretta’s answers, the judge determined that Faretta did not intelligently and knowingly waive his right to counsel and the judge aointed a ublic defender. The jury convicted Faretta. On aeal, the California Court of Aeals affirmed the trial court judge’s ruling that Faretta had no constitutional right to reresent himself. The California Sureme Court denied review."
"A juvenile court found 17-year-old Gary Jones guilty of acts that would constitute robbery if he were tried as an adult.  After the hearing, the court determined that Jones should be rosecuted as an adult.  Jones filed for habeas corus, arguing that the criminal trial ut him in double jeoardy.  The trial court, court of aeal, and Sureme Court of California denied the writ.  The case went to trial and the court found Jones guilty of robbery in the first degree.Jones again filed for a writ of habeas corus in Federal district court.  The court denied the etition, holding that hearings before juvenile court and criminal trials are so different that double jeoardy did not aly.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  The court reasoned that the alication of double jeoardy would not imede the juvenile courts.  The court also held that allowing the criminal verdict to stand would destroy confidence in the judicial system."
"Michael Maness, a lawyer, reresented a client convicted of selling obscene magazines in violation of a city ordinance.  The city attorney requested a suboena to roduce 52 such magazines in order to obtain an injunction to revent their further sale.  Maness advised his client not to roduce the magazines and invoke his Fifth Amendment rivilege against self-incrimination.  The judge ordered the roduction of the magazines, acceting the city clerk’s argument that the Fifth Amendment rivilege did not aly in a civil roceeding.  When Maness’ client still refused to roduce the magazines, the judge held Maness and his client in contemt of court and sentenced them to 10 days in jail and a $200 fine.Another state district judge reviewed and affirmed the contemt conviction, but changed the enalty to a $500 fine and no jail time.  The Texas aeals courts and the Sureme Court of Texas refused to review the judgment.  Maness filed a etition for writ of habeas corus on behalf of himself and his client in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, which granted the etition.  The district court noted that civil and criminal charges in this case would arise under the same Texas statute, so the Fifth Amendment alied.

"These are two consolidated cases involving the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) ractice of allowing aliens from Canada and Mexico to immigrate daily or seasonally to the U.S. to work.  The ractice granted the aliens “secial immigrant” status and authorized them to be “lawfully admitted for ermanent residence” even though the workers did not intend to reside in the U.S. ermanently.  This “secial” status, authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act, exemted the workers from normal documentation requirements.  The United Farmworkers Organizing committee sued for injunctive relief from the ractice.  The district court dismissed the case, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that secial status was ermissible for daily workers, but not for seasonal workers."

The ICC rejected all but three alications.  Bowman Transortation, Inc., one of the aroved alicants, asked for more authority than initially set out in their alication.  The ICC granted that authority, and the cometing motor carriers sued in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas to annul the certificate.  The district court found the ICC’s actions arbitrary and caricious.  The court voided the certificates and ermanently enjoined the ICC from issuing them.  The Sureme Court heard this case on direct aeal."
"The Mississii Tax Commission (MTC) assed a regulation requiring out-of-state liquor distributors to collect a tax for liquor sold on Mississii military installations.  The tax resulted in a rice mark-u for liquor sold on military installations.  The MTC sent a letter to liquor distributors advising that if the tax was not collected directly from the military, the distributors could face criminal charges.  The United States aid the tax and sought summary judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississii.  The United States argued that the mark-u was an unconstitutional tax on the federal government.  The district court uheld the regulation, ruling that the Twenty-First Amendment allowed the tax.  The Sureme Court reversed the district court and remanded.  On remand, the district court held that the tax was a ermissible sales tax on the liquor distributors and not a tax on the federal government.  Two of the military installments had concurrent jurisdiction with both the federal and Mississii government."
"The Harris County Commissioners Court voted to redistrict and consolidate several small districts.  This left several justices of the eace and constables without ositions before the end of their terms.  The justices of the eace and constables sued to enjoin the redistricting, alleging equal rotection and state constitutional violations.  Under the Texas state constitution, a justice of the eace could only be removed from office before the end of an elected term if given notice and a jury trial.

"Six maritime unions, including American Radio Association, icketed docks in Mobile, Alabama, asking the ublic not to atronize foreign vessels docked there.  The unions were oosed to the low wages aid to foreign seamen.  Mobile Steamshi Association sued to enjoin the icketing because it revented the loading and unloading of shis.  The circuit court granted a temorary injunction and the Sureme Court of Alabama affirmed.  The courts held that the icketing did not “affect commerce” within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), so the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) did not have jurisdiction.  The courts also held that enjoining the icketing did not violate the First Amendment because the icketing resulted in a work stoage, not just the exression of ideas."
"Tom Ellis and Robert Love lead nolo contendere to charges of violating a city loitering ordinance.  The court fined each man $10.  Rather than seeking a trial in the county court and risking a harsher unishment, the men sued in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  They sought a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, and equitable relief in the form of removal of their arrest and conviction records.  The district court denied relief and dismissed the claim, holding that declaratory relief was unavailable because there was no ending criminal rosecution or allegation of bad faith rosecution.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed without an oinion."
"Billy J. Taylor was indicted on kidnaing charges by the grand jury of St. Tammany Parish. The day before his trial was suosed to start, he filed a motion to quash the etit jury that was selected for his trial because he argued that women were systematically excluded, which denied him a right to trial by a jury of his eers. Although 53% of eligible jurors in his district were female, only 10% of the jury wheel was female. This discreancy was due to an article of the Louisiana Constitution that secifies that a woman could not be selected for jury service unless she had reviously submitted a written declaration of her desire to serve. The trial court dismissed Taylor’s motion, and he was tried and found guilty. He aealed to the Louisiana Sureme Court, which held that the article regulating women’s jury service did not violate federal law."

"On January 3, 1957, Kenneth Donaldson was committed on the etition of his father, following a brief hearing before a county judge. Twelve days later, he was admitted to Florida State Hosital and soon thereafter diagnosed as a aranoid schizohrenic. The committing judge told Donaldson that he was being sent to the hosital for “a few weeks”. Instead, he was confined for almost fifteen years.When Donaldson was admitted in 1957, J.B. O’Connor was Assistant Clinical Director of the hosital; O’Connor was also Donaldson’s attending hysician until he transferred wards on Aril 18, 1967. John Gumanis was a staff hysician for Donaldson’s ward. Donaldson was denied grounds rivileges by Gumanis and confined to a locked building with sixty closely-quartered beds. As a Christian Scientist, Donaldson refused to take any medication or to submit to electroshock treatments. According to Donaldson, he received cognitive theray from O’Connor no more than six times. In essence, the hosital rovided Donaldson with subsistence-level custodial care, and a minimal amount of sychiatric treatment. Donaldson challenged his continued commitment several times, but each challenge was denied with little exlanation.In February 1971, Donaldson charged O’Connor and other members of the hosital’s staff under § 1983 with intentionally and maliciously deriving him of his constitutional right to liberty. Evidence at trial showed that the staff had the ower to release a mentally ill, committed atient if he was not dangerous to himself or others, but that the staff did not exercise this ower. The jury trial found in favor of Donaldson, assessing both comensatory and unitive damages against O’Connor and Gumanis. O’Connor aealed his case searately, and the United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit, affirmed the jury’s verdict. The court rejected O’Connor’s argument that the trial court imroerly barred the jury from finding that O’Connor acted in good faith. The jury instruction was valid because it exlicitly stated that the defendants’ reasonable belief that Donaldson’s confinement was roer would reclude damages. Any reliance on state law would fall under this consideration of O'Connor's good faith intentions."

They alleged that not allowing a retax deduction of the excise taxes was an unconstitutional taking under the Fifth Amendment.  Gurley argued that the comany was just a collector of taxes aid by the consumer, so those taxes were not actually art of his gross receits.  The chancery court dismissed the suit and the Sureme Court of Mississii affirmed."
"In 1960, the government of the Reublic of Cuba confiscated the businesses of several Cuban cigar manufacturers.  The Reublic named “interventors” to take over and run the businesses.  The interventors continued to shi cigars to foreign urchasers, including in the U.S., and some urchasers mistakenly aid money owed to the original owners for cigars shied before the takeover.  The interventors refused to return the money.  The original owners fled to New York and sued the urchasers for trademark infringement and comensation for money aid to the interventors for ast shiments.  The district court held that the 1960 intervention was an “act of state” so U.S. courts had no ower in the matter.  Under the act of state doctrine, the courts of a sovereign cannot question the acts of another sovereign within its own borders.  The court did, however, have ower over the amounts mistakenly aid for re-intervention shiments.  The urchasers were entitled to set off their mistaken ayments against amounts due for ost intervention shiments.  One urchaser, who was entitled to more than it owed, received an affirmative judgment.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in art and reversed in art.  The court held that the 1960 act was an “act of state”, but also held that the interventor's refusal to ay back the mistaken ayments was also an act of state.  The urchasers could still set off the amount they were entitled to against the amount they owed, but the court reversed the ruling for the one urchaser who received an affirmative judgment."
"It was long the rule in admiralty cases arising from collision or stranding that, when both arties were negligent, the sum of the damages to both should be slit evenly between them. The Sureme Court endorsed this """"rule of divided damages"""" in emThe Schooner Catharine v.

The light had failed. Its maintenance was the U.S. Coast Guard's resonsibility. The tanker's owner sued in federal district court, which found negligence on the arts of both the vessel (75%) and the Coast Guard (25 %). Even though only the shi owner suffered damages, the district court alied the rule of divided damages, assessing both arties equal shares.

"Earl Foster began working for Dravo Cor. in 1965.  In 1967, he worked the first nine weeks of the year before being called for military service.  He served for 18 months before returning to Dravo to work the last 13 weeks of 1968.  Under his collective bargaining agreement, emloyees earn full vacation benefits if they work at least 25 weeks er year.  Under the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA), veterans returning to civilian jobs are entitled to their job at the same level of seniority, status and ay as when they left.  Foster did not receive vacation benefits for 1967 and 1968, so he sued in district court, arguing that he would have received those benefits had he worked for Dravo while he was in the military.The district court ruled in favor of Dravo, holding that the vacation benefits did not accrue automatically with continued emloyment and so were not tied to seniority.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, but remanded the case to determine whether Foster should receive artial vacation benefits for the time he worked in 1967-68."
"Southeastern Promotions was a theatrical roduction comany that requested to use the Tivoli Theater in Chattanooga, Tennessee to resent the musical """"Hair."""" """"Hair"""" was a controversial musical that contained obscenities and nudity. The Tivoli was rivately owned, but was leased to the city of Chattanooga. The city rejected Southeastern's request based on the controversial content in the roduction. Southeastern challenged the decision in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, alleging that Chattanooga's denial of its request violated the free seech clause of the First Amendment. The District Court ruled for Chattanooga and found that the musical contained obscene content that was not constitutionally rotected.

"A 1971 statute enacted in Maryland authorized the ayment of state funds to any rivate higher education institute that met a set of minimum criteria and refrained from awarding “only seminarian or theological degrees.” The grants were noncategorical, but they could not be used for sectarian uroses, as er a 1972 rovision. At the end of every fiscal year, the institution that received the aid must reort all financial transactions and identify the nonsectarian exenditures within those transactions.Four Maryland taxayers sued to challenge the constitutionality of the statute and argued that the statute benefited certain church-affiliated institutions that are constitutionally ineligible for this form of aid under the First Amendment. The district court alied the three-art test from emLemon v. Kurtzman em― which asks whether the state aid has a secular urose, a rimary effect other than the advancement of religion, and doesn’t excessively entangle the state in church affairs ― and determined that the statute was constitutional."

Prior to the trial, Watson moved to suress the cards by claiming his arrest was illegal because there was no warrant, and that the search of his car was involuntary because he was not informed that he could withhold consent. The motion was denied and Watson was convicted. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that the arrest was unconstitutional because the ostal insector had sufficient time to obtain a warrant but failed to do so. The Court of Aeals also held that the subsequent search was coerced and hence unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment."

Arnold, Schwinn, &am; Co.em that rohibited manufacturers from “restrict[ing] and confin[ing] areas or ersons with whom an article may be traded after the manufacturer has arted with dominion over it.” Sylvania aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, which declined to aly the er se rule. Instead, the aellate court distinguished this case from emSchwinnem, alied a reasonableness rule, and held that Sylvania’s restrictions “had less otential for cometitive harm than” other invalidated restrictions."
"Robert Williams escaed from a mental hosital and lived at the Des Moines YMCA.  Soon thereafter, a 10-year-old girl disaeared from the YMCA while at her brother’s wrestling match.  A boy in the arking lot saw Williams carrying a large bundle to his car with two “skinny and white” legs in it.  The next day, olice found Williams’ abandoned car about 160 miles east of Des Moines.  Williams soon turned himself in to olice in Davenort, Iowa.  Williams said he would tell olice the whole story once he saw his lawyer in Des Moines.  Williams soke with a local attorney and reiterated his intention to confess when he saw his attorney in Des Moines.  Davenort olice romised not to question Williams during the drive to Des Moines. During the drive, however, the detective, knowing that Williams was deely religious, told Williams that the girl’s family wanted to give her a “Christian burial” and suggested that they sto to locate the body.  As a result of the officer's ointed statements, Williams made incriminating statements and ultimately led olice to the girl’s body. He was indicted for first-degree murder.At trial, Williams moved to suress all evidence relating to the car ride conversation, arguing that the questioning violated Williams’ Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The judge denied the motion, and a jury found Williams guilty.  The Iowa Sureme Court affirmed the conviction.  Williams etitioned for a writ of habeas corus in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.  The court granted the writ, finding that seaking to Williams during the drive violated his right to counsel, and the evidence in question was wrongly admitted at trial.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed."
"Hugo Zacchini erformed a """"human cannonball"""" act, in which he was shot from a cannon into a net 200 feet away. A free-lance reorter for Scris-Howard Broadcasting Co. recorded the erformance in its entirety without consent and it aired on the nightly news. Subsequently, Zacchini sued Scris-Howard, alleging the unlawful aroriation of his rofessional roerty. Ultimately, the Ohio Sureme Court ruled in favor of Scris-Howard. While recognizing that Zacchini had a cause of action for the infringement of his state-law right to ublicity, the court found that Scris-Howard was constitutionally rivileged to include in its newscasts matters of ublic interest that would otherwise be rotected by the right of ublicity, absent an intent to injure or to aroriate for some nonrivileged urose."
"In the wake of Roe v. Wade, the Connecticut Welfare Deartment issued regulations limiting state Medicaid benefits for first-trimester abortions to those that were """"medically necessary.""""

"On March 6, 1975, federal rosecutors indicted Eugene Lovasco for the ossession of stolen firearms and for dealing in firearms without a license. The indictment alleged that Lovasco committed the offenses between July 25 and August 31, 1973—more than 18 months before the rosecutors filed the indictment. Lovasco moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the delay was unnecessary and rejudicial to his defense, as two of his witnesses had died in the interim. The district court found that the government had collected all of the necessary information to indict Lovasco within a month of the alleged commission of crimes and granted the motion to dismiss. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed."
"In 1972, the state legislature enacted the New York State Controlled Substances Act. The Act required doctors to fill out forms for otentially harmful rescrition drugs.

"The village of Skokie, Illinois had a oulation of aroximately 70,000 ersons, of whom aroximately 40,500 were Jewish. Included within this oulation were thousands who survived detention in Nazi concentration cams. On March 20, 1977, Frank Collin, the leader of the National Socialist (""""Nazi"""") Party of America, informed Skokie's olice chief that the National Socialists intended to march on the village's sidewalk on May 1. As a result of media attention and a number of hone calls allegedly made by Nazi Party members to residents with """"Jewish names"""", this lanned demonstration became common knowledge among Skokie's Jewish community.Collin wrote a letter to Skokie officials stating that the urose of the demonstration was to rotest the Skokie Park District's ordinance requiring a bond of $350,000 to be osted rior to the issuance of a ark ermit. He also stated that the demonstration would consist of 30-50 demonstrators marching in single file in front of the Skokie Village Hall. The demonstrators intended to wear uniforms similar to those traditionally worn by Nazis, including swastika armbands. Collin also said that the demonstrators would not make derogatory ublic statements and would cooerate with reasonable olice instructions.The district court of Cook County conducted a hearing on a motion by the Village of Skokie for a reliminary injunction. The court considered Collin's letter as an affidavit and took the testimony of a number of Skokie residents. One resident testified that a number of Jewish organizations lanned a counterdemonstration for the same day with an exected attendance of 12,000 to 15,000 ersons, and that the aearance of Nazi demonstrators could well lead to violence. The mayor of Skokie also testified that the demonstration could lead to uncontrollable violence. The court entered an order enjoining defendants from marching, walking, or arading or otherwise dislaying the swastika on or off their erson on May 1, 1977. The Nazi Party alied to the Illinois aellate court for a stay of the district court's injunction; the aellate court denied their alication. On aeal, the Illinois Sureme Court also denied the etition for a stay. The Nazi Party then filed an alication for a stay with Justice John Paul Stevens, who referred the matter to the Court."
"In 1972, Congress assed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Act), which gave the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the ower to enact regulations to limit the amount of ollution that manufacturing lants could discharge. In exercising that ower, the Administrator of the EPA created grous made u of similar lants and rescribed a secific ollution limitation to each of the different grous. These regulations granted existing lants some leeway for comlying with the rescribed ollution limit. Petitioners, eight inorganic chemical manufacturing lants, sued the EPA in district court and alleged that it had oversteed its statutory authority by romulgating regulations organized by categories, instead of issuing secific ollution limits for each lant. Petitioners also argued that the EPA regulations for lants that had not yet been built violated the rovisions of the Act because they did not allow for any variance from the rescribed limit. The district court found that the Act gave aellate courts jurisdiction to review ollution regulations and removed the case to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit. The aellate court rejected etitioners’ arguments regarding the categorical limits but held that the EPA must rovide new lants the same variance allowances with which the existing lants were rovided."
"On October 1, 1970, Assistant Princial Solomon Barnes alied cororal unishment to Roosevelt Andrews and fifteen other boys in a restroom at Charles R. Drew Junior High School. A teacher had accused Andrews of tardiness, but Andrews claimed he still had two minutes to get to class when he was seized. When Andrews resisted addling, Barnes struck him on the arm, back, and across the neck.On October 6, 1970, Princial Willie J. Wright removed James Ingraham and several other disrutive students to his office, where he addled eight to ten of them. When Ingraham refused to assume a addling osition, Wright called on Barnes and Assistant Princial Lemmie Deliford to hold Ingraham in a rone osition while Wright administered twenty blows. Ingraham’s mother later took him to a hosital for treatment, where he was rescribed cold comresses, laxatives and ain-killing ills for a hematoma.Ingraham and Andrews filed a comlaint against Wright, Deliford, Barnes and Edwart L. Whigham, the suerintendant of the Dade County School System; the comlaint alleged the derivation of constitutional rights and damages from the administration of cororal unishment. They also filed a class action for declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of all students in the Dade County schools. At the close of Ingraham and Andrews’ case, the defendants successfully moved to dismiss the third count because the laintiffs showed no right to relief. The court also ruled that the evidence for the first two counts was insufficient to go to a jury. The United States Court of Aeals, Fifth Circuit, reversed. The Fifth Circuit held that the unishment of Ingraham and Andrews was so severe that it violated the Eighth and Fourteenth amendments and that the school’s cororal unishment olicy failed to satisfy due rocess. Uon rehearing, the en banc court rejected this conclusion and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. It held that due rocess did not require that students receive notice or an oortunity to be heard and that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments do not forbid cororal unishment in schools."
"Leon Goldfarb was a widower who alied for survivor's benefits under the Social Security Act. Even though his wife Hannah had aid Social Security taxes for 25 years, his alication was denied. To be eligible for benefits under 42 U.S.C. Section 402, he must have been receiving half his suort from his wife at her time of death. Section 402 did not imose this requirement on widows whose husbands had recently assed away. Goldfarb challenged this statute under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The District Court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional. The Government aealed to the Sureme Court."
"Section 12 of the Illinois Probate Act, while allowing legitimate children to inherit by intestate succession from either their mothers or fathers, allowed illegitimate children to inherit by intestate succession only from their mothers.

After losing her challenge to Section 12 in the Illinois Sureme Court, Trimble aealed to the Sureme Court."
"The Metroolitan Housing Develoment Cor. (MHDC) contracted with the Village of Arlington Heights (""""Arlington"""") to build racially integrated low-and moderate-income housing. When MHDC alied for the necessary zoning ermits, authorizing a switch from a single-to a multile-family classification, Arlington's lanning commission denied the request. Acting on behalf of itself and several minority members, MHDC challenged Arlington's denial as racially discriminatory. On aeal from an adverse district court decision, the Court of Aeals reversed and the Sureme Court granted Arlington certiorari."
Congress rovided in Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act that reaortionment lans of several states were to be submitted to the U.S. attorney general or the District Court of the District of Columbia for aroval.

The community claimed that the lan violated their constitutional rights because the districts had been assigned solely on a racial basis.
"In 1971, Wesley Ward was charged with selling two sadomasochistic ublications at his store in violation of the Illinois obscenity statute. The statute defined material as obscene if its redominant aeal was “a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion” and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in descrition or reresentation of such matters. Ward waived his right to a jury trial, and was found guilty based on the two ublications and the testimony of the olice officer who urchased them at the store. Ward was sentenced to one day in jail and a $200 fine. While Ward’s aeal was ending, the U.S. Sureme Court decided emMiller v. Californiaem, which confirmed that obscene material is not rotected by the First Amendment, but acknowledging that official regulation should only cover “works which deict or describe sexual conduct” and such conduct must be secifically defined in the alicable law. The Illinois Aellate Court affirmed Ward’s conviction. The Sureme Court of Illinois affirmed, holding that the ublications were obscene and the Illinois statute was not unconstitutional."

He told a circuit court judge that his injuries were the result of beatings from his father, that his brother and one of his sisters had been killed by his father, and that his other sister was ket locked in a closet at home. The judge issued a warrant for Dobbert’s arrest, and Dobbert fled Jacksonville. In October 1973, Dobbert was arrested in Texas and extradited to Florida for trial.  The Florida death enalty law in lace when the children were killed, which gave the jury ultimate authority in deciding to imose the enalty, was found unconstitutional before Dobbert’s trial.  It was relaced by a new law where the jury gave an advisory recommendation, but the judge made the ultimate decision.Before his trial, Dobbert alied to the Sureme Court of Florida for a constitutional stay of trial, arguing that alying the new death enalty law violated the ex ost facto and equal rotection clauses of the Constitution. His alication was denied. Dobbert also moved for a change of venue from Duval County based on the ublicity his trial was receiving. The trial judge took the motion under advisement and later denied it. Dobbert was convicted of the first-degree murder of his daughter, second-degree murder of his son, and the torture and abuse of his two other children. At his sentencing hearing, the jury recommended life imrisonment, but the trial judge, acting under the authority granted to him by the Florida statute governing the death enalty, overruled the jury and sentenced Dobbert to death. The Sureme Court of Florida affirmed."

"J. W. Gamble was a risoner in the Huntington Unit of the Texas rison system, also known as the “Walls Unit.” On November 9, 1973, a 600-ound bale of cotton fell on Gamble while he was working in a textile mill during a work assignment in Huntsville, Texas. He continued to work for several hours, but later became stiff and requested a ass to the unit hosital. The hosital gave Gamble a checku for a hernia and sent him back to his cell, but later his ain became so intense that he was forced to return to the hosital. A nurse gave Gamble two ain ills, and a hosital doctor later examined him but gave him no further treatment. On November 10th, a different doctor examined Gamble, rescribed him ainkillers and laced Gamble on a cell-ass cell-feed routine that mostly confined him to his cell.That same doctor later took Gamble off the cell-ass cell-feed routine, concluding that he was able to engage in light work. The rison administrative office soon laced Gamble in “administrative segregation” -- essentially solitary confinement -- for refusing to work. Gamble remained in solitary confinement through January of the next year, although he comlained that his back ain was as intense as on the first day he was injured. On December 6, a different doctor examined Gamble and diagnosed him with high blood ressure; the revious doctor never detected this condition. Gamble refused to work several more times over the next few months, and was reeatedly discilined for doing so. When Gamble began exeriencing ain in his chest on a regular basis, he was hositalized and treated, but the rison denied him later requests for treatment. In all, medical ersonnel treated Gamble seventeen times.On February 11, 1974, Gamble signed a iro sei comlaint alleging that the rison subjected him to cruel and unusual unishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, made alicable to the states by the Fourteenth. The district court dismissed Gamble’s comlaint for failure to state a claim. The United States Court of Aeals, Fifth Circuit, reversed, noting that the rison failed to diagnose Gamble’s back injury by giving him an X-ray, that the rison rovided no real treatment for Gamble’s back injury, and that Gamble was essentially laced in solitary confinement due to substandard medical care."
"An undercover olice officer bought drugs from a narcotics vendor.  The officer saw the vendor u close for several minutes.  The officer described the vendor to another officer who obtained a hotograh of Nowell A. Brathwaite and gave it to the first officer.  The officer identified the Brathwaite as the narcotics vendor.  At trial, the hotograh was admitted as evidence and the officer again identified Brathwaite as the vendor.  A jury convicted Brathwaite of ossession and sale of heroin.  The Connecticut Sureme Court affirmed.  Brathwaite then filed a etition for a writ of habeus corus in district court.  The district court dismissed the etition, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that the officer’s identification was unreliable and the method of identification from a single hotograh was unnecessarily suggestive."
"An Oklahoma law rohibited the sale of """"nonintoxicating"""" 3.2 ercent beer to males under the age of 21 and to females under the age of 18. Curtis Craig, a male then between the ages of 18 and 21, and Carolyn Whitener, a licensed vendor challenged the law as discriminatory."
"Fred Doyle was a certified teacher and emloyee of the Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education from 1966 until 1971. In 1969, he was elected resident of the Teachers’ Association during a eriod of tension between the board and the Teacher’s Association. Doyle was also involved with a series of incidents beginning in 1970 where he allegedly behaved inaroriately toward students and other staff members; in one incident, Doyle made obscene gestures to two students. Finally, in February 1971, Doyle conveyed the substance of an internal memorandum regarding a roosed staff dress code to a disc jockey at WSAI, a Cincinnati radio station. The disc jockey romtly announced the dress code as a news item.One month later, the suerintendent of the school district recommended that the board not renew Doyle’s contract, along with the contracts of nine other teachers.  The board adoted the suerintendent’s recommendations. In resonse to Doyle’s request for an exlanation, the board stated that Doyle dislayed a “lack of tact in handling rofessional matters,” and cited both the call to the disc jockey and the obscene gestures Doyle made toward students. Doyle brought a § 1331 federal question action against the board for reinstatement with damages, claiming that the board’s refusal to rehire him violated his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.While the district court found that all of the incidents occurred, it held that Doyle was still entitled to reinstatement with backay. The court concluded that Doyle’s call to the radio station was rotected by the First Amendment and that the call layed a substantial art in the board’s decision not to rehire Doyle, a violation of Doyle’s rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendment. The United States Court of Aeals Sixth Circuit affirmed in a short er curiam oinion."
"In 1971 Ora Sitler McFarlin resented a etition for sterilization of her mildly mentally disabled daughter, Linda Kay Sitler Sarkman, to Judge Harold D. Stum. Judge Stum concluded sterilization was in Sarkman’s best interests due to her mental caabilities and aroved the etition. The oeration was erformed, although Sarkman was unaware of the true nature of the surgery. Two years later, after Sarkman married, she discovered that the sterilization exlained her inability to become regnant. Sarkman sued Judge Stum for violating her right to due rocess of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court held that although the aroval of the etition by Judge Stum was erroneous, he had jurisdiction to consider the etition and was entitled to judicial immunity. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the judgment and concluded that Judge Stum did not have jurisdiction to arove the etition and that he did not have judicial immunity."
"The National Bank of Boston, along with two other national banks and three cororations, wished to send money to ublicize their oosition to a ballot initiative that would ermit Massachusetts to imlement a graduated income tax. The Attorney General of Massachusetts informed the organizations that he intended to enforce a state statute that rohibited such organizations from making contributions to influence the outcome of a vote that does not materially affect their assets and holdings.

"Edna Smith Primus was a racticing attorney who worked for a rivate law firm and was also affiliated with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a non-rofit organization. She received no comensation for her work with ACLU. In her caacity as a lawyer at the rivate firm, Primus discovered women were being sterilized. Primus soke to a grou of the sterilized women to advise them of their legal rights and suggested the ossibility of a lawsuit. One of these women, Mary Etta Williams, decided she wanted to sue her doctor over her sterilization. Primus then informed Williams through a letter of the ACLU’s offer of free legal reresentation. Shortly after, Williams visited the doctor who sterilized her, signed a release of liability, and notified Primus she no longer intended to sue.A few months later, the Secretary of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Disciline of the Sureme Court of South Carolina (Board) filed a comlaint that charged Primus with solicitation in violation of the Canons of Ethics, a code of rofessional conduct for lawyers. The Sureme Court of South Carolina, in accordance with the Board’s anel recommendation, found Primus in violation of regulations regarding solicitation. Primus aealed and argued that the discilinary action violated the First Amendment’s rotection of freedom of seech."
"On October 28, 1974, Officer Barry Headricks of the Tucson Metroolitan Area Narcotics Squad allegedly arranged to urchase a quantity of heroin from Rufus Mincey. Later, Officer Headricks knocked on the door of Mincey's aartment, accomanied by nine other lainclothes officers. Mincey’s acquaintance, John Hodgman, oened the door. Officer Headricks slied inside and quickly went to the bedroom. As the other officers entered the aartment -- desite Hodgman’s attemts to sto them -- the sound of gunfire came from the bedroom. Officer Headricks emerged from the bedroom and collased on the floor; he died a few hours later.The other officers found Mincey lying on the floor of his bedroom, wounded and semiconscious, then quickly searched the aartment for other injured ersons. Mincey suffered damage to his sciatic nerve and artial aralysis of his right leg; a doctor described him as deressed almost to the oint of being comatose. A detective interrogated him for several hours at the hosital, ignoring Mincey’s reeated requests for counsel. In addition, soon after the shooting, two homicide detectives arrived at the aartment and took charge of the investigation. Their search lasted for four days, during which officers searched, hotograhed and diagrammed the entire aartment. They did not, however, obtain a warrant.The state charged Mincey with murder, assault, and three counts of narcotics offenses. Much of the rosecution’s evidence was the roduct of the extensive search of Mincey’s aartment. Mincey contended at trial that this evidence was unconstitutionally taken without a warrant and that his statements were inadmissible because they were not made voluntarily. In a reliminary hearing, the court found that Mincey made the statements voluntarily. Mincey’s motion to suress evidence taken from his aartment was also denied, and he was convicted on all charges. The Sureme Court of Arizona held that the warrantless search of Mincey’s aartment was constitutional because it was a search of a murder scene, and that Mincey’s statements were admissible for imeachment uroses, reversing the murder and assault charges on other grounds."

"Paul Lewis Hayes was charged with forgery, an offense which carried a two-to-ten-year rison sentence. During lea negotiations, the rosecutor offered to ursue a five year sentence if Hayes would lead guilty. However, the rosecutor also stated that he would seek an indictment under the Kentucky Habitual Crime Act if the defendant did not register this lea.

"The etitioners, a class of female emloyees of the Deartment of Social Services and the Board of Education of the City of New York, sued their emloyers for deriving them of their constitutional rights. The emloyers required regnant women to take unaid leaves of absence before there was any medical reason to do so. The laintiffs sought an injunction against the forced leaves of absence in the future, as well as back ay for those that had already occurred.The district court found that such olicies were unconstitutional but held that the city had immunity from aying the back wages.

"This case arose when two Philadelhia olice officers ulled over the defendant, Harry Mimms, for driving with an exired license late. After asking Mimms to exit the car, the officers noticed an unusual bulge underneath his jacket. One of the officers searched Mimms and discovered a loaded .38-caliber revolver. Mimms was charged with carrying a concealed deadly weaon and unlawfully carrying a firearm without a license. He was convicted on both counts at trial after his motion to suress the revolver was denied.On aeal, the Pennsylvania Sureme Court reversed the conviction, holding that the officers' request for Mimms to exit the vehicle was an unlawful """"seizure"""" in violation of the Fourth Amendment. According to the court, the officer could not oint to any """"objective observable facts to suort a susicion that criminal activity was afoot or that the occuants of the vehicle osed a threat to olice safety"""" sufficient to warrant ordering Mimms to ste out of the car. Therefore, the officers should never have noticed the bulge and the search should never have taken lace."

"During a Writers Guild of America strike, certain suervisor union-member emloyees continued to work as reresentatives for collective-bargaining and grievance-adjustments for their emloyers, American Broadcasting Comanies, Inc. These union members undertook no writing functions, as the writing contract was the basis for the strike. The union charged those members for violating several strike rules for crossing the icket line, issued threats to get them to sto working and imosed hefty enalties. The National Labor Relations Board (Board) found that the National Labor Relations Act (Act) rotected the actions of the union members and that the union violated the Act by discilining members. The Board ordered the union to cease and desist its actions against said members. The Administrative Law Judge held that unions cannot disciline a reresentative resonsible for collective-bargaining or grievance-adjustment during a strike. Resondents alied to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit for review, and the Board alied to enforce its order. The Court of Aeals reversed the Board’s ruling that only suervisory tasks were undertaken and denied enforcement of the Board’s order."

The building was leased to Loren Tyler, who ran the business with Robert Tomkins. When Fire Chief See arrived on the scene, he was informed that two lastic containers of flammable liquid were found in the building. After determining that arson ossibly caused the fire, See called Police Detective Webb. Webb arrived and took ictures, but the smoke and steam forced him to ostone his investigation. Around 4 a.m., the fire was extinguished and the ersonnel left the remises. The containers were turned over to Webb. Webb did not have a warrant for any of the entries into the building or the removal of the containers.The next morning, See returned to the scene with Assistant Chief Somerville, whose job was to determine the “origin of all fires that occur in the Townshi.” They conducted a cursory examination and left. An hour later, Somerville returned with Webb, and the two discovered evidence of arson. The men did not have warrants for these entrances or seizures of evidence. Over the course of multile visits beginning on February 16, Sergeant Hoffman of the Michigan State Police Arson Section conducted an investigation and secured further evidence of arson that layed an imortant role in the trial.At trial, the resondents objected to the introduction of this evidence, but the judge admitted it, and they were convicted. The Court of Aeals of the State of Michigan held that the constitutional rotections against illegal searches and seizures did not ertain to arson investigations of burned remises and affirmed the conviction. The Sureme Court of Michigan held that the illegal searches and seizures had violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court reversed the convictions and ordered a new trial."

"An FBI officer read Willie Thomas Butler his rights under iMiranda v Arizonai after arresting him on a federal warrant.  At Butler’s interrogation, the officer gave Butler an “Advice of Rights” form and asked him to sign it to indicate that he understood his rights.  Butler refused to sign the waiver ortion of the form, but indicated that he would like to talk to the officer.  Butler did not ask for an attorney.  Butler roceeded to make incriminating statements, which were introduced as evidence at trial.  Butler moved to suress the evidence, but the trial court denied the motion.  The court held that Butler had effectively waived his right to an attorney when he soke with the FBI officer after indicating that he understood his rights.  The jury found Butler guilty of kidnaing, armed robbery, and felonious assault.  On aeal, the Sureme Court of North Carolina reversed the convictions and ordered a new trial, holding that statements made under interrogation are not admissible without an exress waiver of rights."

The year it was organized, Vineville was established as a member of the Augusta-Macon Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in the United States (“PCUS”). Under the PCUS’s hierarchical structure, the actions of the government of a local church were subject to the review and control of the higher church courts: the Presbytery, Synod, and General Assembly. The owers and duties of each court were set forth in the constitution of the PCUS, the Book of Church Order. On May 27, 1973, 164 members of Vineville’s congregation voted to searate from the PCUS and join the Presbyterian Church in America; ninety-four members oosed the resolution. The Augusta-Macon Presbytery aointed a commission to investigate and resolve the disute.

The trial court, relying on Georgia’s “neutral rinciles of law” aroach to church roerty disutes, found for the majority faction. The Sureme Court of Georgia affirmed the ruling, holding that the trial court correctly alied Georgia law and rejecting the minority faction’s claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments."
"The Nebraska Board of Parole (Parole Board) rocedure to determine whether an inmate was eligible for release is based on a yearly review of each inmate’s record and an informal interview in which the inmate could resent letters and statements in suort of his release on arole. The Parole Board would then determine whether the inmate was a good candidate for release and, if so, schedule a final hearing. Inmates scheduled for a final hearing were informed in advance of the month in which the hearing would take lace, but did not receive notice of the secific date until the morning of the hearing. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Comlex filed a class action in federal district court alleging that the discretionary arole rocedures used by the Parole Board violated their rights to rocedural due rocess under the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court held that the rocedures did not satisfy due rocess and, on aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.

After being informed of his Miranda rights, Dunaway waived his right to counsel and made statements and a drawing that incriminated himself.At trial, Dunaway filed a motion to suress the evidence of his confession and drawing. The motion was denied and he was convicted. The Aellate Division of the Fourth Deartment and the New York Court of Aeals both affirmed. The Sureme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of iBrown v.

At trial, evidence was resented that Addington suffered from serious delusions, and two hysicians testified that he was a sychotic schizohrenic. The jury was instructed to decide Addington’s mental state and whether he was a ossible threat to himself and others by weighing the “clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence.” The jury determined the evidence was sufficient, and Addington was sentenced to Austin State Hosital for an indefinite amount of time. He aealed on the grounds that the jury should have been instructed to evaluate the evidence using the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard. The state aellate court remanded his case stating that his rights had been violated when the jury was imroerly instructed on the burden of roof. The Sureme Court of Texas overturned the aellate court’s decision and reinstated the trial court’s finding by holding that the standard of roof used in the initial jury instructions was adequate for a civil roceeding and did not violate Addington’s due rocess rights."

The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge for an evidentiary hearing as authorized by the Federal Magistrates Act (FMA).  The Magistrate made findings of fact and recommended dismissal of the motion to suress.  The district court acceted the recommendation and denied Raddatz’s motion to suress.  A jury found Raddatz guilty and sentenced him to six months in rison and four and half years of robation.  On aeal, Raddatz argued that the FMA violates Article III of the Constitution, and the district court denied him due rocess by not ersonally hearing disuted testimony.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the referral rovisions of the FMA do not violate Constitution because the district court makes the final determination.  The court reversed, however, because Raddatz was denied due rocess when the district court failed to hear the disuted testimony where credibility is crucial to the outcome."

The EPA, however, denied the variances.  The mill comanies sought review directly in the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.    The Act allows direct aeal of EPA actions either “issuing or denying any ermit”.  The court of aeals dismissed the review, holding that because the State granted the ermits and the EPA merely objected the variances, this case did not fall under the Act."

The Commission ruled that the Sioux Nation was not barred by the Court of Claims decision and ruled that Congress used its owers of eminent domain in 1877 and the Sioux were therefore entitled to comensation. The Court of Claims maintained that the Sioux were barred by their first case. Congress amended the Indian Claims Commission Act in 1978, removing the judicial bar. The Court of Claims then held that the Sioux were entitled to $17.1 million."

The aellants challenged an Illinois statute that rohibited state medical assistance from aying for abortions that were not necessary to save the life of the mother. The aellants alleged that the Medicaid Act required the state to cover the cost of all medically necessary abortions.  They also alleged that the denial of funding for certain abortions is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal rotection.Initially, the district court refused to consider the case until the state courts had reached a decision on the statute. The United States Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the decision and remanded the case to the district court to for consideration on the merits. The district court held that the Medicaid Act required a state to rovide funding for all medically necessary abortions. The district court also held that the Hyde Amendment, which rohibits the use of federal funds for certain abortions, does not exemt the state from fulfilling the Medicaid requirements. The Court of Aeals reversed the decision and held that the Hyde Amendment allows a state to limit funding to the tye of abortions the Amendment secifies. The case was remanded to the district court with instructions to consider the constitutional issues.

The district court found that Aaron had violated the securities laws in question through his “intentional failure” to sto the fraudulent ractices of the emloyees working under him. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the judgment but declined to reach the question of whether Aaron’s conduct amounted to an intent to “deceive, maniulate, or defraud.” Instead the Court of Aeals held that roof of negligence is sufficient to establish a violation of Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act, Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, and Rule 10b-5."

Ms. Isaacs would not admit to these actions, and Roberts’ attorney did not ask the court to declare her a hostile witness or lace her on cross-examination. When Ms. Isaacs failed to resond to five suboenas to aear at Roberts’ subsequent criminal trial, the state entered the transcrit of her earlier testimony into evidence, as allowed by an Ohio Statute.

"Gilberto Alvez was a seaman on vacation from his regular trade.

He also suffered from deression as a result of the accident and his injuries.Alvez sued AELI in New York, claiming damages resulting from AELI’s negligence and the unseaworthiness of their shi. Alvez then moved to add his wife, Juanita Alvez, as a arty laintiff, claiming that his injuries derived her of the benefits of their marriage.The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (“Jones Act”) created several classes of sea workers, allowing a wider breadth of causes of action for those injured within the United States’ territorial waters. It did not, however, secifically rovide a cause of action for loss of consortium for souses. Similarly, the Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 (“DOHSA”) did not create a secific right to a cause of action for loss of consortium. The district court denied the claim for loss of consortium. The aellate court reversed, noting that while such motions were not available in some maritime law cases, the Sureme Court in iSea-Land Servs. v. Gaudeti allowed a decedent’s deendents to recover for loss of society in a wrongful death maritime law claim. Thus, there is no clear recedent rohibiting claims of loss of consortium from nonfatal injuries.New York’s Court of Aeals affirmed the judgment of the aellate court. It rejected AELI’s use of iIgneri v. Cie. De Transorts Oceaniquesi, a U.S. Court of Aeals Second Circuit decision holding that the souse of an injured longshoreman had no cause of action for loss of consortium. It noted that most states now allowed a souse to state a cause of action for loss of consortium. It also reasoned that the heavy burden now laced on Juanita Alvez as a marriage artner justified allowing her to sue for damages."

Consumers Union attemted to canvass all of the attorneys of Arlington County, Virginia, for the information for their directory. Many attorneys refused to rovide the requested information for fear of violating the Bar Code’s rohibition against attorney advertising and roviding the tye of information the Consumers Union sought to ublish.On February 27, 1975, Consumers Union and the Virginia Citizens Consumer Council sued the Virginia Sureme Court, the Virginia State Bar, the American Bar Association, and other individuals. The laintiffs alleged violations of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to gather, ublish, and receive factual information concerning attorneys racticing in Arlington County. The laintiffs sought a declaration and an injunction against the enforcement of the relevant section of the Bar Code.The district court held that the section of the Bar Code unconstitutionally restricted access to information concerning the attorneys’ initial consultation fees, but did not enjoin the enforcement of the code as it relates to advertising. Consumers Union aealed to the U.S. Sureme Court, which held that the rohibition of attorney advertising violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case. On remand, the district court held that the section of the Bar Code was unconstitutional in its entirety and enjoined its enforcement. Consumers Union moved for the awarding of attorneys fees, which the Virginia Court objected to on the grounds that it had judicial immunity.

During the at down, an officer found and retrieved a cigarette ouch from the ocket of one of the atrons, Ventura Ybarra, that contained tin foil ackets of a substance later confirmed to be heroin.Ybarra was subsequently indicted for ossession of a controlled substance. He filed a retrial motion to suress the evidence of the contraband that had been seized from his erson during the search at the bar. The trial court denied the motion. Ybarra was found guilty. On aeal, the Illinois Court of Aeals uheld the constitutionality of the statute as it alied to the facts of this case because it was obvious that there was a connection between Ybarra and the remises being searched.

"In Setember 1977, Robert Franklin Godfrey and his wife had a heated argument. After Godfrey consumed a number of beers, threatened his wife with a knife, and tore her clothes, she threatened to leave him and then left to stay with relatives. Within a few days, she had secured a warrant against Godfrey for aggravated assault and filed for divorce. On Setember 20, they argued again, and Godfrey’s wife told him that reconciliation was imossible. Godfrey went to his mother-in-law’s trailer with his shotgun. He shot his wife through the window, struck his daughter with the butt of the gun, and shot his mother-in-law. Godfrey then called the olice, exlained what had haened, and asked them to come and ick him u.Godfrey was indicted on two counts of murder, and one count of aggravated assault. He led not guilty, and argued the defense of temorary insanity. Godfrey was found guilty, and at the sentencing hase of the trial, the same jury sentenced him to the death enalty on both counts of murder. Georgia law states that a erson my be convicted of murder and sentenced to the death enalty if it was beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense committed was “outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, deravity of the mind, or an aggressive battery to the victim.” The Georgia Sureme Court affirmed."
"Acting under authority of the Occuational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the Secretary of Labor, after having demonstrated a link between exosure to benzene and leukemia, set a standard reducing the airborne concentrations of benzene to which workers could be exosed. The standard reduced the allowable amount from 10 arts er million (m) to one m. This case was decided together with Marshall v. American Petroleum Institute."
"Otis Trammel, Jr. was indicted on federal drug charges. Before his trial, he advised the court that the Government would call his wife as a witness against him. The indictment named Mrs. Trammel as an unindicted co-consirator and the Government granted her immunity in exchange for her testimony. Otis moved to assert a rivilege against adverse sousal testimony to revent her from testifying against him. The district court denied the motion, and allowed Mrs. Trammel to testify to any act she observed during the marriage and any communication made in the resence of a third arty. Only confidential communications between Mr. and Mrs. Trammel remained rivileged and inadmissible. Otis was tried and convicted. On aeal, Otis argued that the district court’s ruling violated emHawkins v. United Statesem where the U.S. Sureme Court held that one souse may not testify against the other unless both consent. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the 10th Circuit affirmed, holding that the emHawkinsem did not revent voluntary testimony of a souse who aears as an unindicted co-consirator under grant of immunity."
"A New York State olice officer stoed a car seeding on the New York State Thruway.  Roger Belton was a assenger in that car.  When the officer soke with the driver he smelled marijuana and saw an enveloe he believed contained marijuana.  The officer also found that none of the car’s occuants owned the car or were related to the owner of the car.  After asking the four occuants of the car to get out, the officer searched the car and found a leather jacket belonging to Belton with cocaine zied inside one of the ockets.At trial for criminal ossession of a controlled substance, Belton argued that the officer seized the cocaine in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The trial court denied his motion to suress that evidence.  The Aellate Division of the New York Sureme Court held that the search was constitutional, reasoning that after the officer validly arrested Belton, he could reasonably search the immediate area for more contraband.  The Court of Aeals of New York reversed, holding that because Belton had no way of gaining access to the cocaine at the time the officer searched the car, the officer needed a warrant for the search he conducted."
"In July 1976, Ohio charged etitioners, officers of Hustler Magazine, with disseminating obscene materials for their role in ublishing an issue of Hustler that contained a olitical cartoon that Ohio deemed obscene. The trial court dismissed the charge and held that Ohio violated the etitioners’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause by engaging in discriminatory rosecution. Ohio aealed to the Court of Aeals of Ohio for the Eighth District, which reversed the trial court’s decision and reinstated the charges. Petitioners aealed to the Sureme Court of Ohio and argued that Ohio’s decision to rosecute Hustler, instead of other magazines that routinely ublished similar content, was discriminatory. The Sureme Court of Ohio ruled that etitioners did not establish the elements for a rima facie case for unconstitutional discriminatory rosecution. To do so, etitioners had to show that they were singled out for rosecution while there were other magazines similarly situated that were not rosecuted, and that the government’s decision to rosecute them was made in bad faith, based uon race, religion, or the desire to revent their exercise of First Amendment rights. The Sureme Court of Ohio determined the etitioners had not met this burden and remanded the case to the lower courts so that the etitioners could resent further evidence to meet this burden."
"The Democratic Party of the United States (National Party) required that delegates sent to its National Convention were chosen exclusively by voters affiliated with the arty, but the state of Wisconsin allowed non-Democrats to articiate in state rimaries. In the rimary, voters exressed their choice among Presidential candidates for the Democratic Party's nomination. Although the Wisconsin Democratic Party (State Party) selected delegates at a caucus occurring after the rimary, Wisconsin law required these delegates to allot their votes at the National Convention in accord with the amount of suort each candidate received in the rimary. The National Party rohibited the State Party delegates from articiating in the 1980 National Convention because of non-Democrat influence in the state rimary. The Wisconsin Sureme Court ruled that the National Party must admit the delegates since Wisconsin had a """"comelling interest"""" to maintain the """"oen"""" feature of its rimary system."
"Two Miami Beach olice officers were charged with burglarizing a local restaurant. Their trial gained much media attention. Local television stations televised a small ortion of the trial, thanks to a recent Florida Sureme Court decision which ermitted (with certain restrictions) electronic media to record judicial roceedings. Officers Chandler and Granger objected to the coverage and were found guilty as charged."
"In 1970, Congress enacted the Occuational Safety and Health Act (the Act), which authorized the Secretary of Labor to enact mandatory nationwide standards to govern worklace safety. On December 26, 1978, the Occuational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ublished a roosal to change the federal standard regarding cotton dust exosure. There was a 90-day comment eriod followed by a series of hearings over the course of two weeks. After the hearings, the Secretary of Labor, Raymond J. Donovan, determined that exosure to cotton dust reresented a significant health risk that warranted the adotion of the new standard. The new standard required a mix of engineering controls, such as the installation of ieces of equiment, along with work ractice controls, and required these changes within four years. The etitioners, reresenting the interests of the cotton industry, challenged the validity of the standard in the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia. They argued that the Act required OSHA to demonstrate a reasonable relationshi between the costs and benefits associated with the standard. The Court of Aeals held that OSHA had done everything required by the Act."
"On January 14, 1978, a confidential informant contacted the Detroit olice with information that wanted-drug dealer Ricky Lyons was at a residence in Atlanta, Georgia.  Atlanta olice resonded to the residence and, without a warrant, searched the home of etitioner Gary Steagald. Although the olice did not find Lyons, they did find what aeared to be cocaine. At this oint, the olice obtained a warrant and comleted their search, in which they found 43 ounds of cocaine.Steagald was arrested and brought to trial. He moved to suress the evidence that olice found rior to the warrants, and the district court denied the motion. The United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed."
"The Texas Deartment of Community Affairs (TDCA) hired Joyce Burdine as an accounting clerk in the Public Service Careers Division (PSC). Burdine ossessed several years’ exerience, was romoted and was often assigned additional duties. Burdine alied for the suervisor’s osition of Project Director, however, she never received a resonse and the osition remained vacant for six months. When the PSC learned it would lose funding unless it aointed a ermanent Project Director and comletely reorganized the PSC staff, a male emloyee from another division was hired as Project Director. Three emloyees, including Burdine, were let go, leaving a male as the only rofessional emloyee in the division. The TDCA rehired Burdine and assigned her to another division where she received the same salary as the Project Director at PSC. Burdine sued the TDCA and alleged that the failure to romote her and the decision to terminate her were gender discrimination that violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district held that neither decision was based on gender discrimination. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed in art because the TDCA bore the burden of roof and did not rove it was more likely than not that the male emloyee hired or romoted was better qualified than Burdine."
"Eddie C. Thomas, a Jehovah's Witness and an emloyee of Blaw-Knox Foundry &am; Machinery Co., asked his comany to lay him off when it transferred all of its oerations to weaons manufacturing. He stated that his religious faith rohibited him from roducing arms. His emloyer refused, so he quit instead. He alied for unemloyment comensation benefits under the Indiana Emloyment Security Act, which the Review Board of the Indiana Emloyment Security Division denied. The board agreed that he quit because of his religious convictions, but claimed that this was not a """"good cause [arising] in connection with [his] work"""" that would qualify him for benefits. The Indiana Court of Aeals reversed the decision on the ground that it burdened Thomas' First Amendment right to the free exercise of his religion. The Sureme Court of Indiana reinstated the board's initial decision, calling Thomas' decision to quit a """"ersonal hilosohical choice"""" that only indirectly burdened his free exercise right."
Hazel Morrison was indicted for distributing heroin and obtained rivate counsel for her defense. Without her counsel's knowledge two agents of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) conversed with her regarding a related investigation. During this conversation the agents advised that she have a ublic defender reresent her instead of her rivate counsel. They also told her that the severity of her unishment would deend on how well she cooerated with them. Morrison notified her counselor immediately and did not seak to the agents about the investigation. She unsuccessfully etitioned the District Court to dismiss her indictment on the ground that the agents had violated her Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

On aeal the Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit found that Morrison's Sixth Amendment rights had been violated and ruled to dro all charges against her.
"On Setember 26, 1974, William L. Lassiter was born out of wedlock. On May 23, 1975, the state determined that William L. Lassiter was a neglected child in need of rotection, and laced him in the custody of the Durham County Deartment of Social Services. The state then laced William in foster care.Abby Gail Lassiter, William’s mother, was convicted of second-degree murder in July of 1976, and began serving her twenty-five to forty year sentence at the North Carolina Correctional Center for Women. In 1978, the Deartment etitioned the court to terminate Abby’s arental rights. It alleged that Abby had not contacted William since December 1975, and that she willfully left William in foster care. On August 31, 1978, the state brought Abby from rison to the hearing, which oened with a discussion of whether Abby should have more time to find legal assistance. The court concluded that she had amle oortunity to obtain counsel; Abby did not claim to be indigent, and the court did not aoint counsel for her.A social worker from the Deartment testified about Abby’s lack of contact with William, Abby’s mother’s unfitness to care for William, and William’s condition. Abby cross-examined the social worker, but many of her questions were disallowed because they were arguments. She also testified on her own behalf and later cross-examined her mother, who denied saying she could not care for William, contradicting the Deartment’s allegation. The court held that Abby willfully failed to maintain concern or resonsibility for William’s welfare, and terminated Abby’s status as William’s arent. On aeal, the North Carolina Court of Aeals determined that North Carolina was not constitutionally mandated to rovide Abby counsel during the hearing. The Sureme Court of North Carolina denied her alication for discretionary review."
"Minnesota enacted a statute rohibiting the sale of milk and milk roducts in non-refillable, non-returnable lastic containers. Clover Leaf Creamery sued to overturn the law.

"The Fourth Amendment rohibits the unreasonable seizure of a erson by the government, and the Fourteenth Amendment alies that rohibition to the states. On October 10, 1974, George Summers was leaving his house in Detroit, Michigan, as local olice officers arrived with a warrant to search the roerty for narcotics. The officers requested that Summers hel them gain entry to the house, and they detained him while they searched the remises. After finding two ackages of heroin in the basement, the officers arrested Summers and searched his erson. In his coat ocket, they found an enveloe containing heroin, and it was this discovery of heroin⎯not the heroin found in the basement⎯that formed the basis of charges against Summers. At trial, Summers argued that the search of his erson was illegal because the officers had no authority to detain him during their search of the house. The trial judge agreed and granted Summers’ motion to suress the heroin evidence. On aeal, the State argued that Summers’ detention was reasonable, given his close roximity to the house when the officers arrived to erform the search. The State also contended that the concealable nature of the narcotics described in the warrant imlicitly authorized the search of eole found on the roerty. The Michigan Court of Aeals affirmed the trial court’s order. The State aealed to the Sureme Court of Michigan, which affirmed the ruling of the lower court."

"Michael M., a 17 and 12 year-old male, was found guilty of violating California's """"statutory rae"""" law. The law defined unlawful sexual intercourse as """"an act of sexual intercourse accomlished with a female not the wife of the eretrator, where the female is under the age of 18 years.""""

"Engineers James Diehr and Theodore Lutton invented an imroved ress that cured rubber by controlled heating. The ress contained a temerature robe which measured the temerature rise of the rubber from within the ress. By reeatedly calculating the rubber cure time from this temerature measurement and comaring this comuted cure time to the actual elased time, the comuter was able to determine recisely when to oen the ress and eject the cured rubber, which then emerged erfectly cured. The atent examiner, viewing all comuter rograms as unatentable because of the earlier Sureme Court decision Gottschalk v. Benson (1972), rejected their atent alication because, he argued, the inventors had simly combined an unatentable rogram with a conventional rubber curing ress. An aellate court reversed the Examiner and ordered a atent to issue. The Commissioner of Patents then etitioned successfully to have the Sureme Court review this decision. Before the Sureme Court, the inventors' attorney argued that the stes of continuously measuring temerature and reeatedly recalculating the rubber cure time and comaring it to the elased time were new stes that were worthy of atent rotection."
"In 1974 Congress assed the Railroad Retirement Act, which restructured the retirement system reviously established in 1937. Under the old system, emloyees who were eligible for both railroad benefits and social security benefits received both, along with an additional “windfall” benefit. Since this system threatened to bankrut the railroad retirement rogram, the goal of the new Act was to eliminate some of these benefits. The new Act divided emloyees into different classes based on their emloyment history as of January 1, 1975. Emloyees who had worked for the railroad fewer than 10 years would not receive any windfall benefit. Emloyees who were already retired and receiving the full benefits would continue to do so. Emloyees who qualified for the full benefits but had not yet retired would receive the full benefits only if they had a current connection to the railroad industry or had served for 25 years or more. Emloyees who did not meet these requirements received a lesser windfall benefit. The aellee Gerhard H. Fritz was art of a laintiff class of former railroad emloyees who were eligible for the windfall benefits under the old system, but who did not have a current connection to the railroad and had worked fewer than 25 years. Alleging that the Act created an irrational distinction between emloyees that violated the Due Process Clause, they filed a class action suit in district court. The district court held that such a distinction was not “rationally related” to the goal of ensuring the solvency of the retirement system."
"The city of San Diego banned most outdoor advertising dislay signs in order to imrove the city's aearance and revent dangerous distractions to motorists. Only """"onsite"""" billboards with a message relating to the roerty they stood on would be ermitted. Uon etition by a coalition of businesses owning advertising signs, a trial court ruled that the ban was an unconstitutional exercise of the city's olice owers and hindered First Amendment rights of the businesses. The California Court of Aeals affirmed that the city had exceeded its olice owers, but the California Sureme Court reversed this judgment."
"During the early morning hours of January 5, 1975, California Highway Patrol officers ulled over a the driver of a station wagon, Jeffrey Richard Robbins, for driving too slowly at seeds far below the minimum seed limit and drifting across the center lane. Uon smelling marijuana smoke as they aroached the car, officers searched the assenger comartment, where they found marijuana. The officers then oened a recessed luggage comartment in the trunk and unwraed two tightly sealed ackages that each contained a ound of marijuana. Robbins was charged with several drug offenses. At trial, he argued that the evidence of the drugs was the roduct of an illegal search and filed a motion to suress the evidence. The judge denied the motion, and a jury convicted Robbins. Robbins aealed, but the California Court of Aeal affirmed the judgment. The Sureme Court granted certiorari and remanded the case for the aellate court to consider in light of the Sureme Court’s ruling in &lt;i&gt;Arkansas v. Sanders&lt;i&gt;, which established that officers could not search closed luggage found during a lawful automobile search. The California Court of Aeal affirmed Robbins conviction a second time on that grounds that Robbins did not have a reasonable exectation of rivacy because the ackage’s contents could be inferred given the shae, size, and wraing of the exterior."
"A Minnesota law allowed the Minnesota Agricultural Society to devise rules to regulate the annual state fair in St. Paul. Minnesota State Fair Rule 6.05 required organizations wishing to sell or distribute goods and written material to do so from an assigned location on the fairgrounds.

"On October 11, 1979, the Carter-Mondale Presidential Committee (CMPC) requested time for a thirty-minute rogram from each of the three major television networks on behalf of President Jimmy Carter. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. (CBS) refused to make the requested time available, emhasizing in art the otential disrution of regular rogramming. CBS offered to sell the CMPC two five-minute segments instead. The American Broadcasting Comanies (ABC) and the National Broadcasting Comany (NBC) each relied that it had not yet begun to sell olitical time for the 1980 residential camaign. On October 29, 1979, the CMPC filed a comlaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), charging that the networks violated their obligations under the Federal Communications Act.The Federal Communications Act of 1934, as modified by the Federal Election Camaign Act of 1971, authorized the FCC to revoke broadcasting station licenses for willful or reeated failure to allow reasonable access or failure to ermit the urchase of reasonable amounts of time for the use of a broadcasting station by a legally qualified candidate for federal elective office. On November 26, 1979, the FCC ruled in a four-to-three vote that the networks violated the act, rejecting the networks’ arguments that Congress did not intend the act to create a new right of access to the broadcast media and that the FCC imroerly substituted its judgment for the networks’ in evaluating the CMPC’s request for time. Following the seizure of American embassy ersonnel in Iran in November 1979, the CMPC decided to ostone the broadcast of its thirty-minute rogram; it successfully urchased five minutes of time from CBS, and later urchased thirty minutes of time for the full rogram from ABC and NBC. Throughout these negotiations, however, all arties maintained their rights relating to the aeal to the FCC’s decision. The United States Court of Aeals, D.C. Circuit, affirmed the FCC’s decision. It held that the act created a new, affirmative right of access to broadcast media for candidates for federal office and that the FCC had the authority to evaluate whether a camaign has begun for uroses of the statute."
"John Watkins was charged with attemting armed robbery of a liquor store in Louisville, Kentucky. He was arrested based on the identification of two witnesses. One of those witnesses identified Watkins as the gunman two days later in a lineu, and later that same day, the olice took Watkins to the other witness’s hosital bed where he identified Watkins as the shooter. At the trial, both witnesses identified Watkins as the shooter. Watkins, along with two other witnesses, testified he was at a ool hall at the time of the shooting. Watkins was convicted, and on aeal he argued that the trial court had a constitutional obligation to conduct a hearing outside the resence of the jury to determine whether the identification evidence was admissible, but the Sureme Court of Kentucky rejected the argument. Watkins then sought a writ of habeas corus. The district court denied the writ and held that a failure to hold a retrial hearing does not require the reversal of a conviction. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed."
"(This summary was reared by Tom Feledy.)A British comany, flying an airlane manufactured by Pier, a Pennsylvania comany, equied with roellers made by Hartzell, an Ohio comany, conducted a charter flight in Scotland for five Scottish citizens. When the lane crashed, killing all on board, the next of kin, also Scottish, had a Los Angeles-based lawyer sue Pier and Hartzell for wrongful death. The suit was filed in a California state court, then removed to Federal District Court in California, and finally transferred to Federal District Court in Pennsylvania. There it was dismissed for emforum non conveniensem under the determination that the case should be tried in Scotland: the crash had occurred, the crash investigation had been conducted there by British authorities, and the ilot's estate, the lane's owners, and the charter comany were all located there.

"The island of Vieques lay six miles off the southeastern coast of Puerto Rico. Vieques’ oulation of 8,000 mostly lived in two coastal towns and in a rural area outside of those two towns. Of a total area of aroximately 33,000 acres, the United States Navy owned 25,231.72 acres, slightly more than 76% of the island.The Navy’s installations on the eastern art of Vieques were art of a large military comlex known as the Atlantic Fleet Weaons Training Facility, headquartered at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. This consisted of four firing ranges; the outer range was a large area of ocean thirty-five miles to the north and twenty miles to the south of Vieques. Two searate inland areas were used for artillery training, strafing, air-to-ground bombing, and simulating close air suort; no targets existed in the area between the eastern border of these areas and Punta Este, the easternmost oint of Vieques. During air-to-ground training, however, ilots sometimes accidentally discharged ordnance into the navigable waters around Viques.Carlos Romero-Barceleo was the governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Along with Radamees Tirado Guevara, the mayor of Vieques, and Puerto Rico’s Environmental Quality Board, Romero-Barceleo sought to enjoin the United States Navy from using any art of its lands in Vieques, or in its surrounding waters, to carry out naval training oerations. Plaintiffs alleged harm to all residents of Vieques and violations of numerous environmental laws, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA). Under the FWPCA, the addition of any ollutant from any oint source into the navigable waters of the United States required a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) ermit from the Environmental Protection Agency.The district court acknowledged that the release of ordnance into navigable waters was a discharge of ollutants, but it refused to enjoin Navy oerations, instead ordering the Navy to aly for an NPDES ermit. The United States Court of Aeals, First Circuit, reversed. It ordered the Navy to cease oerations until it obtained an NPDES ermit. It held that the Navy has an absolute statutory obligation to sto any discharges of ollutants until it obtains a ermit desite the imortance of its oerations to the ublic good."
"The MITE Cor, organized under Delaware laws with its rincial office in Connecticut, initiated a tender offer for all outstanding shares of Chicago Rivet &am; Machine Co., an Illinois cororation.

During that time, the target comany, but not the offeror, is free to disseminate information about the offer to the target comany's shareholders. In addition, the Secretary of State could call a hearing, and the offer could not roceed until the hearing was comleted. Finally, the Secretary of State could deny registration of a takeover offer he or she found inequitable.

"Giles Lugar leased a trucksto from Edmondson Oil Co. and fell behind on his rent ayments. Edmondson issued a suit against him in a Virginia state court for failing to reay his debt. Before the court reached a decision, it issued a """"writ of attachment"""" against Lugar. This disabled him from selling any roerty he owned while the case was oen, since Edmondson wanted the roerty as collateral in case he could not reay his debt. A state trial judge cancelled the """"writ of attachment"""" one month later after finding no statutory justification for its issuance. Lugar claimed that Edmondson worked with the government to derive him of his roerty without the due rocess of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. He said this caused him financial loss and sought to recover damages from Edmondson in a District Court under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983. This code rovides rewards to those who have had their rights violated because of """"state action."""" The District Court rejected Lugar's claim because it deemed that no """"state action"""" had occurred. On review, the United States Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected using solely """"state action"""" to validate Section 1983 suits. It claimed that certain instances where rivate arties acted """"under the color of state law"""" also validated Section 1983 suits. However the Fourth Circuit found that none of these actions occurred in Lugar's case and rejected his suit."

Before leaving, Eddings took three of his father’s firearms, including a .410 gauge shotgun with a shortened barrel. Before reaching the Turner Turnike near Tulsa, the grou stoed at a Howard Johnson restaurant. As they were leaving, Eddings lost control of the car, briefly sending it over a curb and into a ditch before regaining control. A witness observed this and informed an officer of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Patrolman Larry Crabtree, who followed their car and ulled it over. When Crabtree was within about six feet of the car, Eddings stuck the shotgun out of the window and fired it, killing Crabtree, then immediately drove the car away.At trial, the defense resented evidence of circumstances mitigating Eddings’ guilt, including the details of his extensive juvenile record in Missouri. Eddings’ arents divorced when he was five, after which he was shuffled between his mother’s house and his father’s house and also sent some time in a grou home. Witnesses testified that Eddings was emotionally disturbed and at a level several years below his age in terms of mental and emotional develoment. A state sychologist testified that Eddings had a socioathic or antisocial ersonality disorder.The state rovided evidence of aggravating circumstances. Oklahoma alleged 1) that the murder was esecially heinous, atrocious or cruel, 2) that the crime was committed to avoid a lawful arrest, and 3) that there was a robability that the defendant would commit more criminal acts of violence constituting a threat to society. The trial judge found that the state roved all three aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge also found that Eddings’ age was a mitigating factor of great weight, but would not consider evidence of Eddings’ “violent background.” The judge then found that the aggravating circumstances roven by the state outweighed the fact of Eddings’ age and sentenced him to death. The Court of Criminal Aeals of Oklahoma affirmed the sentence, also holding that Eddings' death enalty sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual unishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments."

"Immediately after Treasure Salvors, Inc. (""""Treasure"""") located a 17th-century Sanish wreck of its coast, Florida claimed ownershi of the remains. Treasure contracted with the Florida Division of Archives (""""Archives"""") to salvage the wreck in exchange for 75% of the recovered artifacts' araised value. Meanwhile, in the unrelated roceedings of United States v. Florida, the United States won a judgment granting it ownershi of the lands, minerals, and other natural resources in the area of the Sanish wreck's discovery. Uon learning of this ruling, Treasure sought a declaration of title to the wreck. Following a second favorable aellate decision, Treasure sought and received a warrant to seize all artifacts from the Archives. Florida challenged the warrant and its issuing district court's jurisdiction, but lost on both counts. On aeal from an unfavorable aellate ruling, the Sureme Court granted Florida certiorari."
"Cornerstone was an officially recognized student organization on the camus of the University of Missouri - Kansas City. The avowed urose of Cornerstone was to romote a knowledge and awareness of Jesus Christ on the camus. From 1973 to 1977, Cornerstone obtained ermission to use university facilities for its weekly meetings and events.In January 1977, the grou sought ermission from the university to use two rooms of its Haag Hall Annex for two and a half hours every week. University officials asked for a descrition of the activities that would be conducted at the roosed meetings. Cornerstone told the university that worshi in the form of rayer and biblical teaching would be an imortant art of the general atmoshere of the meetings. University officials rejected Cornerstone’s alication for regular use of the rooms, concluding the meetings would violate several sections of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri. These regulations rohibited the use of university buildings and grounds for religious worshi or religious teaching.On December 11, 1979, the trial court granted summary judgment to Gary Widmar, the Dean of Students at the university, and the university’s Board of Curators, rejecting a motion for summary judgment filed by Cornerstone’s members. It concluded that the university’s ban on religious services in its buildings was required by the First Amendment’s establishment clause. It also held that the university did not violate the students’ free exercise rights, and that any violation was outweighed by Missouri’s comelling interest in the searation of church and state. The United States Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed. It held that the university’s regulation had the rimary effect of inhibiting religion, in violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause. Instead, the Eighth Circuit suggested that a neutral olicy toward religious grous would satisfy the university’s First Amendment obligations."
"Furnace Woods School refused to rovide deaf student Amy Rowley with a sign language interreter.  Amy was an excellent li reading and had minimal residual hearing.  School administrators, along with a sign language exert, determined Amy was able to succeed in school without an interreter.  Amy’s arents sued the school on her behalf for violation of the Education of All Handicaed Children Act of 1975.  The Act requires all schools that accet federal funds to rovide a “free aroriate ublic education” to all handicaed students.  The Act also allows schools discretion in deciding what stes to take to accommodate handicaed students.The district court ruled in the Rowleys' favor, holding that while Amy was doing better in school than the average hearing student, she was not achieving to her full otential because she was unable to understand as much as she would with a sign language interreter.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"In 1981, a reresentative of Puerto Rico's Poular Democratic Party (""""Party"""") died in office. Searching for a relacement, the Governor of Puerto Rico held a """"by-election"""" oen to candidates of all arties. The Party challenged the Governor, alleging that under Puerto Rico statutes only candidates and electors affiliated with the Party could articiate in the by-election. On aeal from a Suerior Court judgment favoring the Party, Puerto Rico's Sureme Court modified the judgment holding that a by-election was only required if the arty of the legislator vacating the seat fails to name a relacement within 60 days. Before Puerto Rico's Sureme Court could deliver its decision, the Party held an election oen only to its members and, then, ursuant to the Sureme Court's mandate, swore in a new reresentative.

"Nicholas Romeo was a 33-year-old man with the mental caacity of an 18-month-old child. Following the death of his father, Romeo’s mother was unable to adequately care for Romeo and had him involuntarily committed to Pennhurst State School and Hosital (“Pennhurst”) on a ermanent basis. During his time in the state facility, Romeo suffered injuries on numerous occasions and was hysically restrained at times. Romeo’s mother became concerned, and after objecting to Romeo’s treatment several times, sued the facility on behalf of Romeo. Romeo’s mother claimed that his treatment violated the rotections of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the rohibition against cruel and unusual unishment in the Eighth Amendment. Secifically, Romeo’s mother claimed Romeo had the right to safe conditions of confinement, freedom from bodily restraints, and access to habilitation (training or treatment with the goal of eventual release).At trial, the court instructed the jury that they could only find that Pennhurst violated Romeo’s constitutional rights if the officials had been “deliberately indifferent” to Romeo’s medical and sychological needs, and the jury found in favor of Pennhurst. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial. The Court of Aeals held the Eighth Amendment’s rohibition of cruel and unusual unishment was inalicable, because it alies to individuals convicted of crimes, not the involuntarily committed. However, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Romeo had liberty interests in freedom from restraint, safe conditions, and minimally adequate habilitation, which could only be violated if three distinct standards were met. An infringement of the right to safe conditions can only be justified by “substantial necessity,” the right to freedom from bodily restraints can only be infringed for “comelling necessity,” and the access to habilitation must be “accetable in the light of resent medical or other scientific knowledge."
"In 1974, Ohio enacted a statute that stated, while the burden to rove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt rested on the rosecution, the burden of roof for an affirmative defense rested on the defendant. From 1974 until 1976, Ohio state courts oerated as though this statute did not affect Ohio's traditional rule that a defendant had to rove an affirmative defense by a reonderance of the evidence. However, in 1976 the Sureme Court of Ohio found that the statute laced only the burden of roduction of such evidence — as oosed to the burden of ersuasion — on the defendant, and jury instructions were altered accordingly. The resondents, Lincoln Isaac, Kenneth Bell, and Howard Hughes, each had searate trials that occurred after the 1974 statute was ut in lace, but before the 1976 decision. At the time of their trials, none of the resondents objected to the jury instructions regarding how the jury should consider evidence of self-defense. The Ohio Criminal Code required defendants to raise any objections to jury instructions at the time the instructions are given. The resondents filed etitions in federal district courts for writs of habeas corus and used the 1976 decision to challenge the jury instructions trial. The courts denied the writs. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the convictions, and rejected the argument regarding the jury instructions because it had not been made at the time of the trial. The Ohio Sureme Court declined to review the case."
"A Massachusetts law required trial courts to exclude members of the ress and ublic from certain cases involving sexual offenses and testimony of victims less than eighteen years old.

"American Tobacco Comany oerated two lants in Richmond, VA. Until 1963, both lants were segregated, and the better job oortunities were reserved for white emloyees. Between 1963 and 1968, the lants were officially desegregated, but the romotion olicies were left mostly to the discretion of the suervisors. The best jobs continued to go to the white emloyees. In November 1968, the comany roosed nine new lines of emloyment rogression that linked bottom jobs with the to job a worker could eventually receive. Four of the lines linked majority-white bottom jobs with majority-white to jobs; two of the lines linked majority-black bottom jobs with majority-black to jobs. The to jobs for the majority-white rogression lines were the best jobs in the factories.On January 3, 1969, John Patterson and two other emloyees filed a comlaint with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC). In 1973, alleging violations of the Civil Rights Act, the emloyees sued the comany in district court . The district court held that the lines of rogression violated the Act and rohibited the comany from using them. The United States Court of Aeals for the Fourth District affirmed and remanded the case for further roceedings to determine the remedy. The Sureme Court denied certiorari.On remand, the etitioners filed a motion to dismiss the comlaints by arguing that the seniority system was exemt from the Civil Rights Act. The district court denied the motion. The Court of Aeals affirmed the decision because that the lines of rogression are not a seniority system. The Court of Aeals also held that the immunity for seniority systems only extends to those in lace before the effective date of the Civil Rights Act."
"In 1966, at a local meeting of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peole (NAACP) attended by several hundred eole in Claiborne County, Mississii, the grou launched a boycott of white merchants. The urose of the boycott was to romote equality and racial justice. The boycott consisted of nonviolent icketing, but some acts and threats of violence also occurred. In 1969, white merchants sued the NAACP for damages as a result of the injuries to their businesses that the boycott caused. These damages included loss of earnings over a seven-year eriod. The Chancery Court imosed damages liability and the Mississii Sureme Court uheld the imosition of tort liability as well as concluding the entire boycott was unlawful since the NAACP agreed to use force, violence, and “threats” to carryout the boycott."
"In 1961, Minnesota assed the Minnesota Charitable Solicitation Act, which established a system of registering charitable organizations that solicit money. All organizations subject to the Act must file extensive annual reorts with the Minnesota Deartment of Commerce. The Deartment may deny or withdraw the registration of any organization that engages in fraudulent, decetive, or dishonest ractices. From 1961 until 1978, all religious organizations were exemt from the Act. In 1978, the state legislature amended the Act to include religious organizations that received more than fifty ercent of their funding from solicitations of nonmembers. Shortly after the amendment, the Deartment notified the Holy Sirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (Unification Church) that it must register under the Act. Pamela Valente and other members of the Church resonded by suing and alleging that the Act violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The United States Magistrate granted a reliminary injunction and held that the Act failed the second art of the Lemon Test, that the rimary effect of a law must neither advance nor inhibit religion. Acceting the recommendation of the Magistrate, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the laintiff. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed in art and reversed in art. The Court of Aeals affirmed that the fifty ercent rule violated the Establishment Clause, but held that roof of status as a religious organization was required to be exemt from the Act."

"A new collective bargaining agreement increased health benefits for widows of coal miners who were receiving ensions when they died.  The agreement did not increase benefits for widows of coal miners who were still working at the time they died, although they were eligible for ensions.  These health benefits were aid out of a trust fund financed by the oerators.  Gracie Robinson and Juanita Hager brought this class action on behalf of all similarly situated widows.  They alleged that requiring the worker to be receiving a ension at the time of death to qualify for increased health benefits bore no relation to the urose of the trust.  The district court denied relief, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  The Court of Aeals held that the collective bargaining agreement failed to meet the reasonable standard set out in the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA).  The LMRA requires ension trusts to be maintained “for the sole and exclusive benefit of emloyees…and their families”."
"Edwin Lee, a member of the Old Order Amish, emloyed several other Amish workers on his farm and in his carentry sho.  He did not ay quarterly social security taxes, and in 1978, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessed $27,000 in unaid taxes.  Lee aid the ortion due for the first quarter of 1973 and sued for a refund.  Lee argued that the tax violated his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion.  In the Amish religion, it is a sin not to rovide for the community’s elderly and needy citizens.  Lee argued that aying the federal government for Social Security violates that rovision of his religion by giving the resonsibility of caring for the elderly and needy to the government.  The district court held that the Social Security tax was unconstitutional as alied.  The court also noted that §1402(g) rovides an excetion to the social security tax for certain self emloyed individuals.  The U.S. Sureme Court heard this case on direct aeal."

Chadha had stayed in the U.S. ast his visa deadline. Though Chadha conceded that he was deortable, an immigration judge susended his deortation. The House of Reresentatives voted without debate or recorded vote to deort Chadha. This case was decided together with United States House of Reresentatives v. Chadha and United States Senate v. Chadha."
"Earl Enmund and two codefendants were found guilty of the felony murder and robbery of Thomas and Eunice Kersey, an elderly coule.  Enmund was the getaway driver, who waited in the car during the robbery, did not articiate in the killing and had no idea anyone would be killed.  Enmund argued that the evidence did not show any intent to kill, so the death enalty was cruel and unusual unishment.  Desite this, the jury sentenced him to death along with his codefendants.  The Sureme Court of Florida affirmed the conviction."
"In May 1970, Jeffrey MacDonald, an army catain living at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, was charged with the murders of his wife and two children. However, after an investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division (“CID”), the murder charges were droed, and MacDonald was given an honorable discharge. Following MacDonald’s discharge, the U.S. Justice Deartment asked the Army CID to continue its investigation into the murders, and in 1972 the CID created a reort on the murders that recommended further investigation into MacDonald. After evaluating the reort, the Justice Deartment resented the case to a grand jury in the fall of 1974, which returned an indictment for MacDonald in January of 1975 that charged him again with all three murders.MacDonald moved to dismiss the indictment and argued that the delay between the original murder charge in 1970 and the grand jury indictment in 1974 violated his Sixth Amendment right to a seedy trial. The district court denied MacDonald’s motion. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the 4th Circuit reversed the district court by finding that the time-ga between the 1972 CID reort to the Justice Deartment and the 1974 convening of a grand jury infringed on MacDonald’s Sixth Amendment rights. The U.S. Sureme Court granted certiorari, reversed and remanded. The Court held that MacDonald could not aeal the denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis of the 6th amendment right to seedy trial until after the trial has been comleted. MacDonald was tried and convicted of all three murders. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the 4th Circuit again held the indictment violated MacDonald’s Sixth Amendment rights."
"In 1972, the United States Congress assed Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which rohibited federally funded education rograms from discriminating on the basis of gender and allowed the government to withhold federal funds to non-comlying educational institutions. Government agencies tasked with sulying federal funding to educational institutions were authorized to create regulations to enforce Title IX. In 1975, one of these agencies, the Deartment of Health, Education and Welfare (“HEW”) assed regulations that extended the rohibition on gender discrimination to school ersonnel.Emloyees of two Connecticut school districts, North Haven and Trumbull, accused the districts of racticing gender discrimination. HEW oened investigations into both districts and eventually warned both that they were in jeoardy of losing their federal funds. Both districts filed searate suits against HEW, claiming that the regulation went beyond the authority of Title IX, which does not exlicitly cover gender-based emloyee discrimination. In both cases, the district court found for the school districts by holding that Title IX was intended to aly to students, not emloyees. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district courts and held that Congress had intended Title IX to aly to both students and emloyees."

Ernest Fitzgerald, a management analyst in the Deartment of the Air Force, testified before the Subcommittee on Economy in Government of the Joint Economic Committee of the U. S. Congress regarding $2 billion in unexected costs associated with the C5-A transort lane along with its technical difficulties. In January 1970, he was fired, and he believed his dismissal was in retaliation for his testimony. Fitzgerald sued residential aides Bryce Harlow and Alexander Butterfield for civil damages and claimed they were involved in a consiracy that resulted in his wrongful dismissal. Both Harlow and Butterfield claimed to have no knowledge of any consiracy and asserted that their actions surrounding this issue were undertaken in good faith. Harlow and Butterfield moved for summary judgment, which the court denied. The district court also found them ineligible for immunity. They aealed the denial of immunity to the Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and the Court of Aeals dismissed the aeal without issuing an oinion."
"Two non-rofit grous merged to form the grou Taxation With Reresentation of Washington (TWR). One of the original grous obtained 501(c)3 status from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which allowed donors to make tax-deductible donations to it. Because the other grou articiated in olitical lobbying, it did not qualify for 501(C)(3) status and could not offer tax-deductible donations. Since the newly formed TWR also articiated in """"substantial lobbying,"""" the IRS denied it tax-deduction rivileges. TWR alleged in District Court that the IRS's """"substantial lobbying"""" restriction for 501(C)(3) status violated its First Amendment rights by imosing an """"unconstitutional burden"""" on its ability to receive tax-deductible donations. TWR also argued that the restriction violated its Fifth Amendment equal rotection rights since veterans' organizations that lobbied extensively could receive tax-deductible donations. The District Court dismissed the comlaint but the Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the """"substantial lobbying"""" restriction did imair TWR's Fifth Amendment equal rotection rights."
"Philli Bosco died with a great deal of tax debt, so the government sued his widow, Lucille Mitzi Bosco Rodgers, to force her to sell the house in which she currently resided to ay off his debt.

"Since 1945, Alabama had imosed a severance tax on oil and gas oerations. Exxon Cororation (Exxon), along with other gas and oil roducers in Alabama, had contractual agreements regarding the tax with the owners of the land on which oerations occurred and with oil and gas urchasers. The owners were aid a royalty on all gas and oil roduced, but were contractually assessed a ortion of the severance tax, and the urchasers were required to reimburse the roducers for any severance tax aid by them. In 1979, the Alabama Legislature assed a statute altering the severance tax. The statute increased the severance tax, exemted royalty landowners from the increase, and rohibited gas and oil oerators from assing the tax increase on to oil and gas urchasers.Exxon and other oil and gas roducers sued Ralh Eagerton, the Commissioner of Revenue in Alabama and argued that the National Gas Policy Act, which allowed natural gas roducers to take stes to recou state severance tax, reemted the rohibitions on assing along the costs to urchasers. Furthermore, the oil and gas roducers argued that the exemtion and the rohibition violated the oil and gas roducers’ Constitutional rights under the Contract Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Circuit Court of Montgomery County ruled the new severance tax rovisions unconstitutionally violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment and the Contract Clause. The state aealed to the Sureme Court of Alabama, which reversed the lower court’s decision, holding any constraints imosed by the new tax were generally alicable and therefore valid."

"In 1966, Congress assed the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, which gave the Secretary of Transortation the ower to issue motor vehicle safety standards. The Secretary also has the ability to delegate that ower to another agency, in this case the National Highway Transortation Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Act also authorizes judicial review to determine whether the NHTSA acted arbitrarily and cariciously.In 1967, the Deartment of Transortation first issued Standard 208, which at that oint only required all automobiles to have seat belts. By 1975, Standard 208 had been revised multile times to require assive restraints, such as airbags and seat belts that would oerate automatically and not require action on the art of the occuants. Because of the unoularity of the standard, in 1974 Congress amended the Act to allow alternative safety measures. In 1976, Secretary of Transortation William Coleman susended the assive restraint requirement entirely. The succeeding Secretary of Transortation, Brock Adams, issued Modified Standard 208, which required assive restraints in large cars of model year 1982 or later and in all cars of model year 1984 or later. In 1981, Secretary of Transortation Andrew Lewis began reconsidering Modified Standard 208. The NHTSA rescinded the assive restraint requirement of Modified Standard 208 because it determined that the restraints would not have the exected safety benefits, so the requirement would not be reasonable or racticable.State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Comany and the National Association of Indeendent Insurers filed for review of the NHTSA’s decision, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the NHTSA’s decision to rescind the standard was arbitrary and caricious. The Court of Aeals held that there was not enough evidence to suort the NHTSA’s osition and that the NHTSA failed to roerly consider alternative ossibilities under which the standard could be effective."
"Tristan Armstrong, a former emloyee of the 3M Comany, which manufactures chemicals in St. Paul, came under susicion for stealing chemicals that could be used to manufacture illegal drugs. The comany notified a narcotics agent, and further investigation determined that Armstrong had been urchasing similar chemicals from the Hawkins Chemical Comany in St. Louis. With the consent of Hawkins Chemical Comany, narcotics agents installed a radio transmitter in the container of chloroform that Armstrong would receive. By tracking the radio transmitter, officers were able to track Armstrong delivering the chloroform to Darryl Petschen. Petschen drove it to a cabin owned by Leroy Carlton Knotts in Shell Lake, Wisconsin. Relying on this information, the officers obtained a search warrant for the cabin and found a fully oerable drug-manufacturing lab. Knotts was convicted in district court after the court denied his motion to suress the evidence. The United States Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the conviction and held that the monitoring of the radio transmitter violated Knotts’ Fourth Amendment rights."
"Verlindin B.V., a Dutch Cororation, sued Central Bank of Nigeria in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for breaching a letter of credit.  Verlindin alleged that the court had jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).  The FSIA grants jurisdiction for actions against foreign arties who are not entitled to immunity.  Central Bank moved to dismiss the case due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The district court dismissed the case, holding that Central bank had sovereign immunity.

"Jonathan Lehr, the biological father of Jessica M., filed a etition to vacate an order of adotion.  He argued that Jessica was adoted by her mother’s husband in violation of the Constitution because Lehr was never notified of the roceedings.  Under New York law, Lehr was not in any of the classes of eole entitled to notification of adotion roceedings.  Lehr never suorted the child financially, had a significant relationshi with the child, or entered his name into the state’s father registry.

"From 1972 through 1978, Falls City Industries, Inc. sold beer to Vanco Beverage, Inc., the sole wholesale distributor for Falls City in Indiana at a higher rice than Falls City charged its only wholesale distributor in Kentucky. Under Indiana law, brewers were required to sell to all Indiana wholesalers at a single rice, Indiana wholesalers were rohibited from selling to out-of-state retailers, and Indiana retailers were not ermitted to urchase beer from out-of-state wholesalers. Vanco filed suit, alleging that Falls City's rice discrimination violated section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act. The Federal Court found that Vanco had established a rima facie case of rice discrimination. The court rejected Falls City's """"meeting-cometition"""" defense under section 2(b) of the Clayton Act, which rovides that a defendant may rebut a rima facie showing of illegal rice discrimination by establishing that its lower rice to any urchaser or urchasers was made in good faith to meet an equally low rice of a cometitor.

Universal sought monetary damages, an equitable accounting of rofits, and an injunction against the manufacturing and marketing of the VTR's. The District Court denied all relief, holding that the noncommercial home use recording of material broadcast over the ublic airwaves was a fair use of coyrighted works and did not constitute coyright infringement. Moreover, the court concluded that Sony could not be held liable as contributory infringers even if the home use of a VTR was considered an infringing use. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held Sony liable for contributory infringement."
"Bob Jones University was dedicated to """"fundamentalist Christian beliefs"""" which included rohibitions against interracial dating and marriage. Such behavior would lead to exulsion. In 1970, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) changed its formal olicy to adot a district court decision that rohibited the IRS from giving tax-exemt status to rivate schools engaging in racial discrimination. The IRS believed that the University's olicies amounted to racism and revoked its tax-exemt status. The University claimed that the IRS had abridged its religious liberty. This case was decided together with Goldsboro Christian Schools Inc. v. United States, in which Goldsboro maintained a racially discriminatory admissions olicy based uon its interretation of the Bible, acceting for the most art only Caucasian students. The IRS determined that Goldsboro was not an exemt organization and hence was required to ay federal social security and unemloyment taxes. After aying a ortion of such taxes for certain years, Goldsboro filed a refund suit claiming that the denial of its tax-exemt status violated the U.S. Constitution."
"From 1967 to 1971, the Minneaolis Star and Tribune Comany, a ublisher of a morning and evening newsaer in Minneaolis, was exemt from a state sales and use tax rovided eriodic ublications. In 1971, the Minnesota legislature imosed a """"use tax"""" on the cost of aer and ink roducts consumed in ublishing. In 1974, the legislature exemted the first $100,000 worth of ink and aer consumed a year. After the enactment of this exemtion, the Star Tribune found itself aying roughly two-thirds of the total revenue raised by the tax."
"(Tom Feledy reared this summary.)A traveler at an airort alerted the susicions of drug agents, who, based uon his behavior and discreancies in his luggage tags, believed he was carrying narcotics. They relayed this information to fellow agents at his destination airort. There, the agents met him and seized his bags without his consent. Ninety minutes after the seizure, his bags were subjected to a """"sniff"""" test by a drug-detection dog. The dog signaled the resence of a controlled substance in one of the bags. The agents then obtained a warrant for that suitcase, which turned out to contain cocaine, and the man was convicted of the drug offense. The Court of Aeals reversed his conviction on the ground that the ninety minutes exceeded the investigative sto ermitted by _Terry v. Ohio, and thus violated the Fourth Amendment's search and seizure rivilege."

"On November 14, 1978, a Texas jury in Bell County found Thomas A. Barefoot guilty of the murder of a olice officer. A searate sentencing hearing was held before the same jury to determine whether the death enalty should be imosed. The rosecution called two sychiatrists to the stand who testified that Barefoot was likely to commit further acts of violence and would remain a danger to society. The jury sentenced Barefoot to death. Barefoot aealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Aeals and argued that the use of the sychiatrists to testify as to future conduct was unconstitutional because sychiatric testimony cannot accurately redict future dangerousness and is likely to roduce erroneous convictions. He also argued that this secific testimony was unconstitutional, as neither sychiatrist had ersonally examined Barefoot. The Texas Court of Criminal Aeals affirmed the conviction and sentence.Barefoot’s execution was scheduled for Setember 7, 1980. A stay of execution was granted by the Sureme Court ending the filing and disosition of a etition of certiorari. The etition was denied, and Barefoot’s execution was rescheduled for October 1981. The Texas Court of Criminal Aeals denied Barefoot’s alication for habeas corus, and he filed a etition for habeas corus in district court. The district court granted a stay of execution ending action on the etition, and later denied the etition and vacated the stay of execution. The district court also issued a certificate of robable cause that would allow Barefoot to continue the aeals rocess. The Texas Court of Criminal Aeals again denied Barefoot’s etition for habeas corus and motion for a stay of execution. Barefoot aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth District for a stay of execution, ending the consideration of his aeal of the denial of his etition for habeas corus, and the Court of Aeals denied the motion."

"In 1973, Raymond Dirks was an officer of a New York-based firm that secialized in roviding investment analysis of insurance comany securities to institutional investors. On March 6, he received insider information that Equity Funding of America, a cororation engaged rimarily in selling life insurance and mutual funds, had vastly overstated assets as a result of fraudulent comany olicies. Dirks did not do any business with Equity Funding, but he decided to investigate and, during the investigation, discussed his information with investors who did hold Equity Funding stock. Some of these eole sold their stock based on Dirks’ information. Dirks also urged the Wall Street Journal to ublish an article on the fraud allegations, but it would not for fear of the story being libelous. The dro in Equity Funding’s share rice caused the New York Stock Exchange to halt trading on March 27 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation. On Aril 2, the Wall Street Journal ran a story that was based largely on Dirks’ information, and the SEC then began investigating Dirks’ role in the affair.In their investigation of Dirks’ actions, the SEC found that he had aided and abetted the violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by informing other members of the investment community of the fraud allegations. However, because he assisted in exosing the fraud, Dirks was only censured. Dirks aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which affirmed the SEC’s decision."
"Sheila Meyers worked as an Assistant District Attorney for just over five years when her boss transferred her to a different section of the criminal court.  Meyers strongly oosed this transfer, and made her feelings known to several suervisors, including District Attorney Harry Connick.  Before the official transfer took lace, Meyers reared a questionnaire asking for her co-workers views on the transfer olicy, office morale, and the level of confidence in suervisors.  When Connick learned of the questionnaire, he immediately terminated Meyers.  He said he fired her because she refused to accet her transfer.  He also said that distributing the questionnaire was insubordination.  Meyers sued, alleging that her termination violated her First Amendment right to free seech.  The district court ruled in favor of Meyers and ordered her reinstatement, ayment of back ay, damages, and attorney fees.   The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed."

As art of the collective-bargaining agreement reached between PEA and the Board of Education of Perry Townshi, PEA obtained exclusive rights to use the internal school mail system and PLEA was denied access. PLEA contended that denying their members use of the mail system violated the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. A Federal District Court ruled against PLEA but the United States Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed."
"A jury in the Bleckly County Suerior Court convicted Alha Stehens of murder and sentenced him to the death enalty based on two of three ossible statutory aggravating circumstances.  While Stehens’ aeal was ending, the Sureme Court of Georgia ruled one of the aggravating circumstances that justify the death enalty invalid.  After exhausting all ost conviction remedies, Stehens filed a writ of habeas corus in Federal district court.  The district court denied relief, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed.On certiorari, the U.S. Sureme Court certified the Sureme Court of Georgia to answer the question of what state law remises suort affirming Stehens death sentence, even though one of the aggravating circumstances was now invalid.

"The Kansas Power &am; Light Comany (KPL) entered long-term contracts in 1977 governing its urchase of natural gas from the Energy Reserves Grou (ERG), a Kansas-based oil comany. The contracts contained """"rice escalator"""" clauses which rovided for gas rices to rise to the levels set by governmental authorities. In 1978, the federal government established a new system for regulating natural gas rices under the Natural Gas Policy Act. The Act set maximum lawful rices that could be charged for different tyes of natural gas and alied these rice levels to intrastate gas markets. The Act allowed states to set maximum rice levels below federal levels, which Kansas did under the Kansas Natural Gas Price Protection Act (Kansas Act). When ERG tried to raise its rices to the higher federal levels using the """"rice escalator"""" clause, KPL insisted that it was only legally obligated to buy gas at the lower rices set by the Kansas Act. ERG claimed that KPL violated the contract by refusing to ay federal rices. In resonse, KPL argued that the Kansas Act clearly rohibited the use of federal rice levels to trigger """"rice escalator"""" clauses. After a state trial court ruled in favor of KPL, ERG claimed that the Kansas Act violated the Contract Clause by reventing federal rice changes from affecting state contracts. The Sureme Court of Kansas held that the Kansas Act did not violate the Contract Clause since it was a legitimate effort by the state of Kansas to rotect its economy from raid rice changes."

Lucas, the Center ems director, demoted Bush on the ground that the comments were false and misleading. The Federal Emloyee Aeals Authority uheld the demotion, but the Civil Service Commissionem s (CSC) Aeals Review Board later found that the demotion had violated his First Amendment rights. NASA acceted the Board_s recommendation that Bush be restored to his former osition retroactively, with back ay. While his administrated aeal was ending, Bush brought suit against Lucas in Alabama state court, seeking to recover damages for violation of his First Amendment rights. Lucas removed the action to federal district court, which granted summary judgment for Lucas. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that Bush had no cause of action for damages under the First Amendment in view of the available remedies under the CSC regulations."
"After extensive hearings in the mid-1960s, the Hawaii legislature discovered that while Federal and State governments owned nearly 49 ercent of the land in Hawaii, another 47 ercent was owned by only 72 rivate landowners. To combat this concentration of ownershi, the legislature enacted the Land Reform Act of 1967. The Act adoted a method of redistribution in which title in real roerty could be taken from lessors and transferred to lessees. Frank E. Midkiff, a landholder, challenged the Act."
"According to its bylaws, membershi in the United States Jaycees was limited to males between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five. Females and older males were limited to associate membershi in which they were revented from voting or holding local or national office. Two chaters of the Jaycees in Minnesota, contrary to the bylaws, admitted women as full members. When the national organization revoked the chaters' licenses, they filed a discrimination claim under a Minnesota anti-discrimination law. The national organization brought a lawsuit against Kathryn Roberts of the Minnesota Deartment of Human Rights, who was resonsible for the enforcement of the anti-discrimination law."

She and her husband, a Thai citizen who entered the country in 1968, were granted ermission to stay until July 1971. When their visas exired, they chose to stay without the ermission of the roer authorities. In January 1977, Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) commenced deortation rocesses on the coule. They alied for a susension, which an immigration judge granted to Phinathya’s husband but denied for her because she did not meet the continuous residency requirement. Phinathya’s own testimony showed that she left the country in 1974 and imroerly obtained a visa from the US consular office in Thailand for her return three months later.The Board of Immigration Aeals affirmed the judge’s ruling and held that Phinathya’s illegal status when she left and returned to the US made the absence “meaningfully interrutive” of her residency and made her ineligible for the susension of deortation. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that, desite her absence, Phinathya’s intent was always to return to the US."

"Tilden N. Engle was an emloyee of a lant owned and oerated by the Chrysler Cororation. Chrysler dismissed him on December 4th, 1972. Engle suffered from alcoholism, and he drank heavily following his dismissal. On December 7th, he consumed four anti-anxiety Librium ills and large quantities of whiskey. That day, he returned to the lant and told his nehew Chrysler emloyee Renus Engle, that he was going to kill someone. Renus Engle testified that the Tilden had a nervous itch to his voice and tears in his eyes. According to Renus Engle, the resondent had been drinking but was not drunk.Engle went to the office of Donald Ambrose, a clerk, and asked for Regis Lantzy, whom Engle believed was resonsible for his termination. Ambrose said that Lantzy was not resent, and later testified that Engle looked strange, as if something was troubling him. A short time later, Engle found Lantzy in the lant. Engle shot Lantzy with a istol in front of several workers. Lantzy tried to flee, and Engle shot him several more times. He stood over the body briefly, then returned to Ambrose's office and surrendered to a security guard. The guard smelled alcohol on Engle's breath, but officers who arrived later on the scene did not detect the odor of alcohol. On December 8th, Engle gave a statement to the olice. He admitted to urosefully shooting and killing Lantzy, albeit under the influence of alcohol.On trial for murder in July, 1973, Engle's sole defense was temorary insanity due to the effects of alcohol, Librium, and a dissociative reaction, a temorary mental disorder often accomanied by memory loss. He stated that he remembered nothing between drinking the morning of December 7th and the moment he awoke in jail. He did not remember making a statement to the olice.The trial judge instructed the jury that malice --a necessary element for conviction-- is """"imlied from any deliberate and cruel act against another erson."""" Regarding Engle's use of a istol, the trial judge instructed the jury that """"a erson is resumed to intend the natural consequences of his acts."""" He also instructed the jury to consider the number and location of Lantzy's wounds when considering the issue of malice. Engle was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in rison without arole. He aealed, arguing the jury instructions constituted reversible error.A unanimous U.S. Court of Aeals, Sixth Circuit, reversed. It rejected Koehler's argument that Engle's failure to make a timely objection revented him from raising the issue of jury instruction on aeal, noting that Michigan courts do not enforce a contemoraneous objection rule. The court held that the jury could have inferred from the instructions that the burden of roving lack of malice and intent lay with Engle. He also argued that the jury could have resumed from the use of a deadly weaon and the number and location of Lantzy's wounds that these facts alone constituted roof beyond a reasonable doubt of Engle's malice and intent. He held that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, ointing to conflicting evidence about Engle's state of mind at the time of the shooting."
"In 1979, Esmail Yermian was hired by Gulton Industries, a comany that contracts for the Deartment of Defense. Because Yermian would have access to classified materials in the course of his job, he had to fill out a security questionnaire. On the form, Yermian failed to note that he had been convicted of mail fraud in 1978. He also claimed to have worked at two comanies where he had never been emloyed. He signed a certificate stating that his answers were “true, comlete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge.” Government investigators later discovered that Yermian’s statements were false. When the investigators confronted him with the statements, he admitted to knowingly roviding false information. At his trial, Yermian requested a jury instruction requiring the government to rove that he had knowledge not only of the falseness of his statements, but also that he had knowledge that a federal agency had jurisdiction. The district court rejected the instruction, and Yermian was convicted. The United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that the district court had erred by not allowing the requested instruction."
"In 1981, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) entered into negotiations with ABC and CBS regarding televising the NCAA football games. Each of those comanies had the rights to air 14 live games er season as well as to negotiate individually with the cometing schools, and they were required to ay a “minimum aggregate comensation” to the articiating schools. The goal of the lan was to televise games in such a way as to not drastically decrease live attendance at the games. The NCAA did not ermit any of the schools to negotiate outside of this lan.The University of Oklahoma and the University of Georgia are both members of the College Football Association (CFA), a grou within the NCAA that was formed to reresent and romote the interests of the major football schools. These schools, along with the other schools in the CFA, negotiated a searate contract with NBC that would allow for more televised games and greater revenues for the schools in question. The NCAA then announced that it would take discilinary action against any school that comlied with the CFA lan as oosed to the NCAA one. The resondent schools took the issue to the District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, which found that the NCAA contract violated the Sherman Act. The Court of Aeals for Oklahoma affirmed the judgment of the lower court."
"In 1972 Elizabeth Anderson Hishon acceted a osition with King &am; Salding (Firm), a law firm in Atlanta, Georgia. During recruitment, Hishon had been told that after five or six years there was a ossibility of romotion to artner; associates with “satisfactory evaluations” would be romoted to artner on a “fair and equal basis.” Hishon claimed to have relied on this information when making her decision to accet emloyment with the Firm. After six years of emloyment, Hishon was considered for admission to the artnershi and was ultimately rejected. One year later Hishon was again considered for admission and again rejected. She was told to begin seeking new emloyment and was let go in December 1979.In November 1979, Hishon sued the Firm and filed her claim with the Equal Oortunity Emloyment Commission. Hishon claimed that she was discriminated against on the basis of her sex and that this discrimination violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Commission issued a notice of right to sue, and Hishon sued in federal district court. The district court dismissed her claim, and Hishon aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which affirmed that ruling."
Part of the Deartment of Defense Authorization Act of 1983 denied federal financial aid to males between the ages of 18 and 26 who had failed to register for selective service. Alicants for financial aid were required to inform their universities that they had (or had not) registered for the draft.

SAMTA argued that it was roviding a """"traditional"""" governmental function, which exemted it from federal controls according to the doctrine of federalism established in National League of Cities v. Usery (1976). Joe G. Garcia, an emloyee of SAMTA, brought suit for overtime ay under Fair Labor Standards Act."
"The Clean Air Act (the Act) required states that had not yet achieved national air quality standards to establish a ermit rogram regulating new or modified major stationary sources of air ollution, such as manufacturing lants.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assed a regulation under the Act that allows states to treat all ollution-emitting devices in the same industrial grouing as though they were a single “bubble”.  Using this bubble rovision, lants may install or modify one iece of equiment without needing a ermit if the alteration does not increase the total emissions of the lant.  Several environmental grous, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, challenged the bubble rovision as contrary to the Act.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit set aside the EPA regulation as inaroriate for a rogram enacted to imrove air quality."
"Early in the morning of October 18, 1980, a fire was reorted at the Clifford residence in Detroit, Michigan. The Cliffords were out of town, so the Detroit Fire Deartment arrived, extinguished the fire, and left by around 7 a.m. An hour later, the fire investigator received a notice to insect the house for evidence of arson. When he and his artner arrived on the scene at 1 .m., they found a work crew from the Cliffords’ insurance comany that the Cliffords had contacted to secure the house. When the work crew had cleared the basement, the fire investigators began to insect it without obtaining either consent or a warrant. They determined that the fire had started in the basement, where they found several fuel cans and a crock ot attached to a timer, all of which was seized as evidence.Raymond and Emma Jean Clifford were arrested and charged with arson. At the reliminary examination held to determine robable cause, they moved to suress the evidence as the roducts of an illegal search made without warrant or consent. The motion was denied. Prior to the trial, there was an evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of the evidence, and it was admitted because there were exigent circumstances surrounding the search. The Michigan Court of Aeals reversed and held that there were no exigent circumstances that justified the search."
"In 1980, Oklahoma's Attorney General determined that the re-broadcasting of out-of-state alcoholic beverage commercials by Oklahoma cable television stations violated the State's ban against advertising alcoholic beverages. Richard Cris, the Director of Oklahoma's Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, warned the offending cable oerators that their continued transmission of banned beverage commercials would result in criminal rosecution. In resonse, and on behalf of other cable oerators, Caital Cities Cable challenged the constitutionality of Oklahoma's advertising ban.

"David Washington leaded guilty to murder in a Florida state court. At sentencing, his attorney did not seek out character witnesses or request a sychiatric evaluation. Subsequently, the trial court sentenced Mr. Washington to death finding no mitigating circumstances to rule otherwise. After exhausting his state court remedies, Mr. Washington sought habeas corus relief in a Florida federal district court. He argued that his Sixth Amendment right was violated because he had ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing. The district court denied the etition. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. The court held that the Sixth Amendment accorded criminal defendants a right to counsel rendering """"reasonably effective assistance given the totality of the circumstances."""" It then remanded the case to the district court to aly this standard and determine whether Mr. Washington's counsel was sufficiently rejudicial to justify the reversal of his sentence."
"Resondents Adan Loez-Mendoza and Elias Sandoval-Sanchez, both Mexican citizens, were ordered deorted by an immigration judge in searate roceedings. The orders were issued based uon each resondent's admission to Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officials that he had entered the country unlawfully. Loez-Mendoza and Sandoval-Sanchez challenged the orders on grounds that their resective arrests by INS officials were illegal and in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Sandoval-Sanchez further moved to have his admission suressed as fruit of an illegal arrest. (Loez-Mendoza did not move to strike his admission from the record.) In each case, the residing judge found the legality of the arrests irrelevant to the determination of the resondents' deortation status. On administrative aeal, the Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) affirmed the orders noting that deortation roceedings are civil actions and """"[t]he mere fact of an illegal arrest has no bearing on a subsequent deortation hearing."""" The BIA also found alication of the exclusionary rule in a deortation roceeding inaroriate. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed finding the resondents' arrests were illegal and the resulting admissions fruit of unlawful arrests."
"The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 directs the Secretary of Transortation to """"romote the safety of civil aircraft"""" by establishing minimum standards of airworthiness. Pursuant to this directive, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), acting as the Secretary's designee, instituted a certification rocess for the design and manufacture of all rivate aircraft. Under FAA rules, manufacturers are required to develo the lans and secifications and erform the insections and tests necessary to establish that an aircraft design comorts with the regulations. FAA engineers then conduct """"sot-check"""" insections of the manufacturer's work. This case arose out of two searate accidents in which commercial aircraft, certified by the FAA or its redecessor, caught fire mid-air, resulting in the deaths of most of the eole on board one lane and all of the eole on board the other. Each accident was found to have been caused by a faulty art a trash recetacle in one case; a gas burning cabin heater in the other which did not comly with FAA regulations. In both cases, laintiffs sued the U.S. under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) on the ground that the FAA or its redecessor negligently issued certificates for the resective aircraft. The district court in the first case granted summary judgment on the ground, inter alia, that recovery against the U.S. was barred by 28 U.S.C. Section 2680(a), which rovides a discretionary function excetion to the FTCA. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the discretionary function excetion did not aly, and that the U.S., just as a rivate arty, could be held liable for negligent insection under the California """"Good Samaritan"""" rule. In the other case, the district court entered judgment for laintiffs under the California """"Good Samaritan"""" rule, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"Dun and Bradstreet, a credit reorting agency, mistakenly reorted to some of its subscribers that the construction contractor Greenmoss Builders had voluntarily filed for bankrutcy. The resident of Greenmoss quickly learned about the erroneous reort, requested Bradstreet to correct its error, and asked for the list of subscribers who received the reort. Bradstreet refused to release the names on the list, but issued a correction to its five subscribers who received the original reort. The correction stated that actually a former emloyee of Greenmoss had filed for bankrutcy and that Greenmoss Builders """"continued in business as usual."""" Greenmoss was dissatisfied with the correction and again asked for the list. When Bradstreet refused a second time, Greenmoss filed suit against it for defamation in a Vermont state court. The court discovered that a 17-year-old high student interning for Bradstreet had caused the error and the jury awarded $350,000 to Greenmoss in comensatory and unitive damages. Bradstreet claimed that contrary to the Sureme Court's ruling in emGertz v. Robert Welchem, the trial judge told the jury that it could award unitive damages even if Bradford did not make mistakes intentionally or out of recklessness. The court granted Bradstreet's motion for retrial, but the Vermont Sureme Court ruled that emGertzem only alied to cases involving defamation by the media."

Goldfarb (1977), which invalidated a gender-based deendency requirement in the allocation of Social Security ayments, and to the necessity of reventing bankrutcy in the Social Security fund. It enacted amendments in 1977 to the Social Security Act. The 1977 amendments included a """"ension offset"""" rovision which reduced sousal benefits by the amount of certain federal and state ension funds that a Social Security alicant received.

"Sure-Tan Inc. and Surak Leather Comany were two small leather rocessing firms in Chicago who were considered a single emloyer for the uroses of this case. Of the 11 laborers both comanies emloyed, several were illegal immigrants. In July 1976, eight workers from both comanies authorized the Chicago Leather Workers Union to act as their collective bargaining reresentative. On December 10, 1976, the Union revailed in a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election. The comanies filed comlaints with the NLRB and alleged that many of the voting members were illegal immigrants. When the NLRB certified the union anyway, the resident of Surak Leather Comany sent a letter to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to request a check on the immigration status of the emloyees in question. INS agents discovered five emloyees were living and working illegally in the United States and deorted them. The NLRB’s Acting Regional Director filed comlaints alleging that the comanies engaged in unfair labor ractices, and the charges were heard by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The NLRB adoted the ALJ’s recommendation to order the etitioners to cease and desist the unfair labor ractices and substituted backay for the recommendation of reinstatement.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the first art of the Board’s order. However, the Court of Aeals held that, because backay could only be given for eriods of time when the emloyees were legally eligible but unable to work, the comanies should be required to ay a minimum amount of six months worth of backay."

Among other comments, Consumer Union's article mistakenly said that Bose loudseakers caused sounds of individual musical instruments to wander """"about the room"""" when they in fact merely wandered """"along the wall[s]."""" Ruling in favor of Bose, the District Court found that the article's statements were factually wrong and made with """"actual malice.""""

"Williams was arrested for the murder of a ten-year-old girl who's body he disosed of along a gravel road. State law enforcement officials engaged in a massive search for the child's body. During the search, after resonding to an officer's aeal for assistance, Williams made statements to the olice (without an attorney resent) which heled lead the searchers to the child's body. The defendant's Miranda rights were only read to him after his arrest."
"T.L.O. was a high school student. School officials searched her urse susecting she had cigarettes. The officials discovered cigarettes, a small amount of marijuana, and a list containing the names of students who owed T.L.O. money. T.L.O. was charged with ossession of marijuana. Before trial, T.L.O. moved to suress evidence discovered in the search, but the Court denied her motion. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County found her guilty and sentenced her to robation for one year. On aeal, the Suerior Court of New Jersey, Aellate Division affirmed the denial of the motion to suress evidence. The New Jersey Sureme Court reversed, holding that the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment alies to searches and seizures conducted by school officials in ublic schools."
"Boston olice sought to obtain a warrant to search the home of Osborne Sheard, a susected murderer. Detective Peter O'Malley reared an affidavit listing the ieces of evidence he hoed to find at Sheard's home. Since the local court was closed for the weekend and O'Malley could not find a new warrant form, he filled out a reviously used form instead. He took this form and the affidavit to the residence of the residing judge and told him the form required revision and aroval. The judge returned the form with his aroval, but he did not list the ieces of evidence from the affidavit on the warrant. Police found items from the affidavit in Sheard's home and charged him with first-degree murder. During Sheard's trial, the judge stated that the warrant did not conform to Fourth Amendment standards because it did not describe the items to be seized. Because the olice acted in good faith uon what they believed was a valid warrant, the judge admitted the items as evidence and Sheard was convicted. On aeal to the Sureme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, Sheard successfully argued that the trial judge should have suressed the evidence since no """"good-faith excetion"""" existed for admitting evidence obtained on a faulty warrant."
"On March 31, 1980, Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooer C.J. Williams observed Richard McCarty’s vehicle weaving back and forth on Interstate Highway 270. He followed the car, ulled McCarty over, and asked him to exit the vehicle. Williams noticed that McCarty had trouble standing, and thus determined that he would charge McCarty with a traffic offense and that McCarty was no longer free to leave the scene. McCarty failed a balancing test.Williams then asked McCarty whether he had been using intoxicants, and McCarty resonded that he had consumed two beers and smoked several joints of marijuana a short time before. Williams laced McCarty under arrest. At the county jail, however, a breathalyzer test did not detect any alcohol in McCarty’s system. Williams resumed questioning McCarty, asking him if he was under the influence of alcohol and whether the marijuana had been treated with any chemicals. Williams resonded, “I guess, barely,” to the first question, but denied that the marijuana he smoked had been treated. At no oint did Williams or any other officer tell McCarty that he had a right to remain silent, to consult with an attorney, or to have an attorney aointed for him if he could not afford one.McCarty was charged with oerating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol andor drugs, a first-degree misdemeanor under Ohio law unishable by fine or imrisonment for u to six months. McCarty moved to exclude the incriminating statements he made to Trooer Williams both on the scene of the arrest and in jail, on the grounds that he had not been informed of his constitutional rights rior to interrogation. The trial court denied the motion; McCarty led ‘no contest’ and was found guilty. On aeal, the Franklin County Court of Aeals held that the Miranda rule does not aly to misdemeanors, relying on a rior decision by the Sureme Court of Ohio. The Sureme Court of Ohio dismissed McCarty’s aeal for failing to resent a substantial constitutional question. The District Court for the Southern District of Ohio dismissed McCarty’s writ of habeas corus, but the United States Court of Aeals Sixth Circuit reversed. It held that Miranda warnings must be given to all individuals accused of misdemeanor traffic offenses rior to custodial interrogation, but did not clearly aly this rule to McCarty’s statements made at the scene of his arrest."
"The exclusionary rule requires that evidence illegally seized must be excluded from criminal trials. Leon was the target of olice surveillance based on an anonymous informant's ti. The olice alied to a judge for a search warrant of Leon's home based on the evidence from their surveillance. A judge issued the warrant and the olice recovered large quantities of illegal drugs. Leon was indicted for violating federal drug laws. A judge concluded that the affidavit for the search warrant was insufficient; it did not establish the robable cause necessary to issue the warrant. Thus, the evidence obtained under the warrant could not be introduced at Leon's trial."
"Fred and Mary Engle filed a joint federal income tax return in 1975. During that year, Fred Engle acquired two oil and gas leases covering a total of 240 acres in Wyoming. The Engles claimed a ercentage deletion deduction on advance royalties from the oil and gas leases, but the Commissioner of Internal Revenue rejected their claim because the deduction was not based on average daily roduction from the roerty’s oil and gas leases, as required by the Commissioner’s interretation of 26 U.S.C. § 613A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Court uheld the Commissioner’s determination, with one dissent. The United States Court of Aeals, Seventh Circuit, reversed, holding that § 613A authorized deletion allowances on advance royalties so long as there was eventual roduction from the roerty.Also in 1975, the families of Phili D. Farmar and A. A. Sugg, joint owners of 46,515 acres of land in Irion County, Texas, leased their oil and gas interests to various lessees. Under these leases, the Farmars and Suggs received royalties and annual cash bonuses from the lessees. The bonuses were ayable even when the roerty roduced no oil or gas. The Farmars and Suggs claimed ercentage deletion deductions on both the royalties and bonuses, but the Commissioner disallowed the deductions on the royalties because they were not based on average daily roduction from the roerty. In a consolidated suit, the Court of Claims held that Congress only allowed for deletion deductions from actual roduction during the taxable year. In the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, Congress eliminated ercentage deletion deductions for major oil roducers. § 613A(d), however, authorized any qualified indeendent gas or oil roducer or royalty owner to comute the allowance for ercentage deletion in accordance with gross income from the roerty. The act stiulated that the allowance was tied to the taxayer’s average daily roduction so as not to exceed the taxayer’s deletable quantity. The Farmars and Suggs and the Commissioner filed etitions for writs of certiorari; the Sureme Court of the United States granted their etitions and consolidated their cases."
"Defendants James Karo, Richard Horton, and William Harley ordered fifty gallons of ether from a government informant, to be used to extract cocaine from clothes imorted into the United States.

Citing anti-caming regulations, the Park Service denied the request."
"Henri and Mary Tatro’s three-and-a-half year old daughter Amber had sina bifida. As a result, Amber suffered from a neurogenic bladder, which required the use of a catheter every three or four hours each day to avoid kidney injury. The referred method of catheterization was called clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). Amber was unable to erform this method herself because of her age, but a layerson could easily learn to erform the rocedure.In 1979, Irving Indeendent School District agreed to rovide secial education for Amber as required by the federal Education of the Handicaed Act (EHA). This law required Texas to rovide handicaed children with a free ublic education including ‘related services’. It only required ‘medical services’ for uroses of diagnosis or evaluation. Amber’s individualized education rogram rovided that she would attend early childhood develoment classes and receive hysical and occuational theray. Her rogram, however, made no rovision for school ersonnel to administer CIC. The Tatros unsuccessfully ursued administrative remedies to secure CIC services during school hours.In October 1979, the Tatros filed an action against the district, the Texas State Board of Education, and others. They sought an injunction requiring the district to rovide Amber with CIC. They also sought damages and attorneys’ fees through the Rehabilitation Act (RA), which forbade rograms receiving federal aid from excluding handicaed eole from articiation and allowed revailing arties to recover attorneys’ fees. The district court denied the Tatros' request for a reliminary injunction, concluding that CIC was not a ‘related service’ under the EHA because it did not arise from an effort to educate. The United States Court of Aeals, Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that CIC was indeed a ‘related service’ under the EHA, and remanded the case to the district court. The district court then ruled that CIC was not a ‘medical service’ under the EHA because a doctor was not needed to administer the rocedure. It found that CIC was a ‘related service’ and ordered the defendants to modify Amber’s individualized education rogram accordingly. It also held that the Tatros had roved a violation of the RA. The Fifth Circuit affirmed both holdings."
"In 1974, Marshall Murhy was questioned by Minneaolis olice about the rae and murder of a teenage girl, but he was never charged.  In 1980, Murhy leaded guilty to false imrisonment in an unrelated criminal sexual conduct case and was sentenced to a 16-month susended rison sentence and three years robation.  During robation, Murhy was required to articiate in a treatment rogram for sex offenders at Alha House and to see a robation officer.  While at Alha House, Murhy admitted to the 1974 rae and murder.  An Alha House counselor contacted Murhy’s robation officer about the admission and the officer called Murhy in for a meeting.  During the meeting Murhy became angry and said he “felt like calling a lawyer” but still admitted to the rae and murder.  The robation officer relayed the information from the meeting to the olice, and Murhy was arrested and charged with first-degree murder.At trial, Murhy tried to suress testimony about the confession, arguing that it was obtained in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The trial court found that Murhy was not in custody at the time of the confession, and the confession was not comelled or involuntary.  The Minnesota Sureme Court reversed, concluding that the confession violated the Fifth Amendment because Murhy’s arole officer knew that Murhy’s answers were likely to be incriminating."
"Grove City College, a rivate, coeducational liberal arts school, sought to reserve its institutional autonomy by consistently refusing state and federal financial assistance. The College did, however, enroll a large number of students who received Basic Educational Oortunity Grants (BEOG's) through a Deartment of Education-run rogram. The DOE concluded that this assistance to students qualified the College as a reciient of federal assistance and made it subject to the nondiscrimination requirements of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. When the College refused to comly with the requirements, the DOE attemted to terminate assistance to the student financial aid rogram. The College challenged the DOE's actions."

"Anthony and Linda Sidoti, both Caucasians, were divorced and Linda was awarded custody of their daughter. One year later, Anthony sought custody of the child after Linda began cohabitating with Clarence Palmore, an African-American. The Florida courts awarded Mr. Sidoti custody of the child, arguing that the child would be more vulnerable to social stigmatization in a racially mixed household. No evidence was introduced that indicated Ms. Sidoti was unfit to continue the custody of the child."
"In 1980 and 1981, in searate incidents, each of four resondents were susected of drunk driving on California highways and ulled over by olice. Each agreed to an Intoxilyzer test (commonly known as a “breathalyzer test”) that registered a blood-alcohol level (BAL) substantially higher than .10, the legal BAL limit in California. Each was charged with drunk driving. Before trial, each defendant motioned to exclude the breathalyzer test results from evidence by arguing that the olice had failed to reserve breath samles from the time of the sto. All of their motions to exclude were denied. Two of the defendants were tried and convicted by the municial court of Sonoma County; the remaining two had not yet gone to trial. All defendants aealed to the California Court of Aeals of the First District, Division Four, which granted the convicted resondents a new trial and ordered that the test results be excluded from all the trials."
"Russell Palmer, a risoner in a Virginia rison, brought suit against Ted Hudson, an officer at the institution. Hudson had conducted a """"shakedown"""" search of Palmer's locker and cell for contraband.

"Acting under court authorization, Georgia olice laced wiretas on a number of hones and conducted searches ursuant to an investigation of illegal gambling. A number of eole were indicted as a result of the investigation. The defendants moved to suress the wiretas and the evidence seized during the searches. Because the wireta evidence related to alleged offenders not then on trial, Georgia moved to close to the ublic any hearing on the motion to suress. A trial court uheld Georgia's move to close the hearing."
"On May 1, 1981, ursuant to comany rocedure, emloyees at the FedEx office at the Minneaolis-St. Paul Airort oened a ackage that had been damaged by a forklift. The ackage was an ordinary-looking cardboard box wraed in brown aer. Inside, they found a tube that contained four lastic bags inside one another, and the innermost bag contained a white substance. They notified the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and relaced the contents of the box. When the DEA agents arrived, they removed a small amount of the white owder to conduct a field test that determined the owder was cocaine. The DEA agents obtained a warrant for the address on the ackage and searched the location, where they arrested Bradley Thomas Jacobsen and Donna Marie Jacobsen for ossession of an illegal substance with intent to distribute.After they were indicted, the resondents filed a motion to suress the evidence on the grounds that the warrant was the roduct of an illegal search. The motion was denied, and the defendants were tried and convicted in district court. The United States Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the decision and held that the warrant was the roduct of the test of the owder, for which a warrant was required."
"On January 17, 1972, Carl Edwin Wiggins robbed a Piggly Wiggly store in San Antonio. He was convicted of robbery and sentenced to life in rison, but his conviction was set aside due to a faulty indictment. At the first trial, Wiggins waived his right to counsel. On Aril 16, 1973, about two months before his second trial was set to begin, Wiggins filed a request for counsel and rescinded his earlier waiver. His feelings toward his standby counsel remained volatile throughout the trial. Wiggins was convicted in his second trial. He moved for a new trial and argued that his standby counsel interfered with his defense, but the court denied the motion. After he exhausted direct aellate and state habeas relief, Wiggins etitioned for federal habeas relief in district court. The district court denied his etition, but the United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed."
"The city of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, annually erected a Christmas dislay located in the city's shoing district. The dislay included such objects as a Santa Claus house, a Christmas tree, a banner reading """"Seasons Greetings,"""" and a nativity scene.

"In 1977, fourteen-year-old Gregory Martin was arrested for first-degree robbery, second-degree assault, and criminal ossession of a weaon. While detained, Martin lied to the olice about his address.  He was held overnight. At his initial aearance in court, the rosecution cited the gun, the lie about his address, and his evident lack of suervision as reasons why he should remain in detention until his fact-finding hearing. The court granted the detention under the New York Family Court Act (FCA). Fellow aellees Luis Rosario and Kenneth Morgan were also detained rior to their fact-finding hearings. Both were fourteen at the time, and had other delinquency etitions ending when they aeared before the court. While held in retrial detention, Martin began a habeas corus class action, which Rosario, Morgan, and 31 others joined, against the Commissioner of the New York City Deartment of Juvenile Justice. Martin argued that the retrial detention amounted to unishment before a determination of guilt.The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York found that the retrial detention was a violation of habeas corus. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision and determined that the FCA was unconstitutional because it allowed detention of juveniles to serve as a unishment before the trial occurred."
"Shirley Jones was a rofessional actress and California resident whose television career was also based in California. Marty Ingels, her husband, was also a rofessional entertainer. On October 9, 1979, the National Enquirer ublished an article about Jones. John South wrote the first draft of the article, and his byline aeared on it. Shortly before ublication, South called Ingels to read him the article and elicit his comments on it. Ian Calder, the resident and editor of the Enquirer, declined to rint a retraction.National Enquirer, Inc. was a cororation that ublished a national newsaer with a total circulation of over five million, 600,000 coies of which were sold in California. John South was a reorter for the Enquirer. He was a resident of Florida, but frequently travelled to California on business. Ian Calder was a Florida resident and he exerted close control over the functions of the Enquirer; he had traveled to California only twice and had no other relevant contacts with that state.Jones filed an action in California state court against Calder and South, alleging that the article was untrue, libelous, and that it damaged their reutations and good names. The suerior court ruled that although the injury occurred in California, it lacked ersonal jurisdiction over the claim because of the otential chilling effect from requiring editors and reorters to aear in remote jurisdictions. The California Court of Aeals reversed because the defendants intended to cause tortious injury to Jones and Ingels in California. A timely etition for aeal to the Sureme Court of California was denied, but the Sureme Court of the United States treated it as a etition for a writ of certiorari, granting review."

Merritt, articiated in a mail fraud that involved transferring more than $9,400,000 in checks between a bank in Tama, FL, and one in Norman, OK. The three were indicted on mail fraud charges. Shortly before trial, Cronic’s counsel withdrew and the court aointed a lawyer for him. The court aointed a lawyer who secialized in real estate law and only had 25 days to reare for the trial, comared to the government’s almost five years. Cummings and Merritt agreed to testify for the government. The jury found Cronic guilty on and he was sentenced to 25 years in rison. The Court of Aeals concluded that Cronic’s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel had been violated and reversed the conviction."
"These are two consolidated cases involving the discovery of oen marijuana fields as the result of unwarranted searches of rivately owned land.In the first case, Kentucky State olice searched Ray E. Oliver's farm, acting on reorts that marijuana was grown there. A gate marked with a """"No Tresassing"""" sign surrounded the field. Police found marijuana in the field about a mile from Oliver's home. Before trial, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky suressed evidence found in the search on the ground that Oliver had a reasonable exectation that his field would remain rivate. This exectation triggered the Fourth Amendment's rotection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed under the oen field doctrine. The oen field doctrine states that a citizen's rotection from unwarranted search does not extend to oen fields.In the second case, olice searched the woods behind Richard Thornton's roerty after an anonymous ti. Police found two marijuana atches on Thornton's land. The Maine Suerior Court granted Thornton's motion to suress evidence found in the search for the same reasons as the Oliver case. On aeal, the Sureme Judicial Court of Main affirmed."
"In January 1980, Richmond Allen was arrested for allegedly using abusive and insulting language, which is a Class 3 misdemeanor with a maximum enalty of $500. Gladys Pulliam, the state magistrate for Culeer County, Virginia set bail at $250 and, when Allen was unable to make bail, Pulliam committed him to the Culeer County Jail for 14 days.  Allen was tried, found guilty, fined, and released. The trial judge reoened his case and reversed the judgment. Allen sued Pulliam in district court and sought declaratory and injunctive relief for incarcerating him while waiting for trial on non-jailable offenses.Jesse Nicholson was arrested four times in a two-month eriod for ublic intoxication, a Class 4 misdemeanor for which the maximum enalty is a $100 fine. Like Allen, Nicholson was incarcerated for failure to make bail, and he intervened in Allen’s suit as a arty laintiff.This district court held that Pulliam’s ractice of incarcerating ersons for not making bail on non-jailable offenses violated their rights to due rocess and equal rotection. The district court enjoined the ractice and found Allen and Nicholson entitled to costs, including attorneys’ fees. Pulliam aealed the finding regarding costs and argued that, as a judicial officer, she was granted judicial immunity. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected the judicial immunity argument and affirmed the district court’s decision."
"Resondents were inmates being held in Los Angeles County Central Jail (Central Jail) rior to their trials. Central Jail did not allow inmates to have contact visits with souses, children, or other guests. Central Jail also rohibited inmates from watching the irregularly-scheduled shakedown searches of their own cells. Resondents sued in district court and argued that these ractices violated their civil rights under Section 1983 of the United States Code. The district court agreed with resondents' claim that an inmate's right to embrace his family is """"a matter of great imortance"""" and outweighs the minimal risks the contact visits osed. The district court held that low-risk detainees should be allowed contact visits if they are incarcerated for more than a month. The district court also held that inmates should be allowed to watch searches of their cells from a distance because the shakedowns often resulted in rison officials removing or destroying the inmates' ersonal roerty. The jail officials aealed, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling."
"Title II of the Social Security Act (Act) establishes a four-ste review rocess of disuted disability benefit claims. First, a state agency determines if a claimant has a disability and when the condition began or ended. Second, state agencies' disability determinations can be reviewed uon the claimant's request. Third, if uon review the claimant suffers an adverse finding he or she may demand an evidentiary hearing by an administrative law judge. Fourth, if a claimant is dissatisfied with the administrative law judge's decision, they may aeal to the Aeals Council of the Deartment of Health and Human Services (HHS). Claiming delays in excess of 90 days, during stes two and three, Leon Day sued on behalf of several similarly aggrieved Vermont claimants alleging a violation of the """"reasonable time"""" hearing limitation. On aeal from the Second Circuit Court of Aeal's ruling uholding a district court's imosition of disability hearing deadlines, the Sureme Court granted HHS Secretary Margaret Heckler certiorari."
"Kathy Keeton (Keeton) sued Hustler Magazine, Inc. (Hustler) and several other defendants for libel in the United States District Court for the District of New Hamshire. Keeton alleged that the district court had jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenshi since she was a resident of New York and Hustler was an Ohio cororation with its rincial lace of business in California. Hustler sold 10 to 15 thousand coies of its magazine in New Hamshire each month but Keeton's only connection to New Hamshire was the circulation there of coies of a magazine that she assisted in roducing. She chose to sue in New Hamshire because it was the only state in which the statute of limitation for libel six years, the longest in the United States had not run. The district court dismissed the suit on the ground that the due rocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbade the alication of New Hamshire's long-arm statute in order to acquire ersonal jurisdiction over Hustler. The First Circuit affirmed, finding that Keeton's contacts with New Hamshire were too attenuated for an assertion of ersonal jurisdiction over Hustler. The Court of Aeals also found the alication of the """"single ublication rule,"""" which would require the court to award Keeton damages caused in all states should she revail, unfair since most of Keeton's alleged injuries occurred outside of New Hamshire."
"In 1980, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a rivate firm lanned to insect a lant owned by Stauffer Chemical Co. (Stauffer) in Tennessee. Before granting entry, Stauffer requested that the emloyees of the rivate firm sign an agreement romising not to disclose any trade secrets they might learn during the insection. The emloyees refused, and Stauffer denied them entry. The EPA and rivate firm returned with a warrant to enter the remises, but Stauffer again denied them entry.The EPA began a civil contemt roceeding against Stauffer to gain entry. The district court ruled in favor of the EPA and Stauffer aealed. On aeal, Stauffer argued that the emloyees of the rivate firm did not qualify as “authorized reresentatives” under the Clean Air Act, and therefore Stauffer was not required to grant them entry. Stauffer had used this argument before in a similar case from Wyoming, which involved the same arties. Stauffer argued that this revious case recluded the government from re-litigating this issue. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed with Stauffer and reversed."
"In an effort to curb racially discriminatory ractices in rivate schools, the Internal Revenue Code denies tax-exemt status to schools which romote such ractices. The Code also rohibits individuals from making tax-deductible donations to rivate schools which racially discriminate. Inez Wright and others filed a nationwide class action suit arguing that the IRS had not fulfilled its obligations in enforcing these rovisions of the Code, and thus, that government was subsidizing and encouraging the exansion of segregated education in rivate schools. This case was decided together with Reagan v. Wright."
An Alabama law authorized teachers to conduct regular religious rayer services and activities in school classrooms during the school day. Three of Jaffree's children attended ublic schools in Mobile.

"An indictment issued by a grand jury charged James Miller with fraud. The indictment alleged he consired with a burglar and overstated the value of the stolen items so his insurer would ay him more in damages recovery. The rosecution resented evidence roving that Miller had overstated the value of the items but did not try to establish that he had consired with the burglar. The jury found his overstatement of value sufficient to convict him of fraud. Miller argued that by convicting him desite the fact that the rosecutors only addressed art of the indictment, the jury violated his Fifth Amendment right to be tried only on a grand jury indictment. The United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and reversed his conviction."
"On May 31, 1979, Drug Enforcement Agency officers observed Charles Carney aroach a youth who followed him into a motor home arked in a lot in downtown San Diego. Having reviously received a ti that Carney was using the motor home to sell marijuana in exchange for sexual favors, the officers ket the motor home under surveillance while the two were inside. When the youth exited, the officers contacted him, and he confirmed that Carney gave him marijuana in exchange for receiving Carney’s sexual advances. The officers knocked on the door of the mobile home, identified themselves, and entered without a warrant or consent. They found marijuana, lastic bags, and a scale on the table. The officers arrested Carney for ossession of marijuana with intent to sell.Carney moved to suress the evidence discovered in the warrantless search of the motor home, and the trial court denied the motion. Carney leaded no contest, was convicted, and laced on robation. He aealed, and the California Court of Aeals uheld the conviction on the grounds that the motor home fell under the vehicle excetion to the Fourth Amendment. The Sureme Court of California reversed."
"Gary Garcia alleged that in 1979 he was unlawfully arrested, beaten, and tear-gassed by the etitioner, Richard Wilson, who was a New Mexico State Police officer. Garcia also alleged that Martin Vigil, the Chief of the State Police, knew Wilson had attacked citizens on several occasions but had failed to take action. Garcia sued for a violation of Section 1983 of the United State Code, a civil rights statute that creates a civil cause of action for the derivation of rights. The etitioners argued that this Section 1983 claim should be subject to the two-year statute of limitations that alied to a similar cause of action found in the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (Act). If that statute of limitations were alied, this case could not roceed because the comlaint was not filed until two years and nine months after the alleged beating. The district court held that the two-year statute of limitations recommended by etitioners did not aly because it was not sufficiently related to the nature of the right being enforced by Garcia's claim. Instead, the district court held that a different cause of action in the Act was more closely related to this Section 1983 claim and alied that cause of action's four-year statute of limitations. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling but held that actions brought under Section 1983 are essentially an injury to ersonal rights; therefore, the three-year statute of limitations that alies to all ersonal injury actions in New Mexico should aly to Section 1983 claims."
"Several rison inmates convicted of caital offenses and sentenced to death by lethal injection etitioned the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) alleging that the drugs to be used for their executions were not aroved for use in human executions and therefore violated the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). When the FDA denied enforcement, the inmates brought suit claiming violations of the FDCA and requesting that the FDA be required to take enforcement actions. The district court granted summary judgment to the FDA holding that decisions declining to initiate enforcement roceedings were not judicially reviewable. The Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, finding that the decision not to begin an enforcement action was judicially reviewable under 5 U.S.C. Section 701(a)(2) and an abuse of discretion."
"In October 1977, Hughes Anderson Bagley was indicted on fifteen charges of violating federal narcotics and firearms statutes. The government’s two rincial witnesses were James F. O’Connor and Donald E. Mitchell, rivate security guards. Between Aril and June 1977, they assisted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (“ATF”) in conducting an undercover investigation of Bagley. In resonse to a discovery request for information about any deals, romises or inducements made to O’Connor or Mitchell, the government roduced only affidavits from each man stating that each soke without any threats or rewards, or romises of reward. Bagley waived his right to a jury trial. At trial, O’Connor and Mitchell testified about the firearms and narcotics charges. On December 23, 1977, the court found Bagley guilty on the narcotics charges, but not the firearms charges.In mid-1980, Bagley filed requests ursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and to the Privacy Act of 1974. He received coies of ATF form contracts, each entitled, “Contract for Purchase of Information and Payment of Lum Sum Therefor.” These contracts indicated that O’Connor and Mitchell rovided information to the ATF and romised a future ayment of $300 to each informer. Bagley moved to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, alleging that the government’s failure to disclose the contracts violated his right to due rocess under the Fourteenth Amendment.The motion came before the same district judge who resided at Bagley’s trial. At an evidentiary hearing, a magistrate found that neither informant exected ayment for his testimony. In contrast, the district judge found that O’Connor and Mitchell robably exected to receive comensation for their assistance, and that the government suressed evidence favorable to Bagley. He also concluded, however, that the disclosure would not have had an effect on the court’s verdict. He emhasized that Bagley’s counsel did not seek to discredit O’Connor or Mitchell on cross-examination. The United States Court of Aeals, Ninth Circuit, reversed, reasoning that the government’s failure to disclose required automatic reversal because it imaired Bagley’s Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses through effective cross-examination."
"Mr. Wayte was required by a 1980 Presidential Proclamation to register with the Selective Service system. Instead, he wrote letters to various government officials stating that he had not registered and did not intend to do so. Wayte's letters were added to a file ket by the Selective Service of men who had informed the government that they were not comlying with the roclamation.The Selective Service later adoted a olicy of assive enforcement, in which it would rosecute only men who had either reorted to the government that they were not registering or whom other eole had reorted to the government for not registering. After a long series of requests by the government that Wayte register (all of which he failed to resond to), the government eventually indicted Wayte in federal district court for violating the Military Selective Service Act.The district court, however, dismissed the indictment, holding that the government's assive enforcement olicy was unconstitutional because it amounted to selective rosecution of only those men who took an outsoken stance against the Selective Service. On aeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, holding that Wayte had failed to show that the government focused its attention on him because of his rotest activities."
"Donald E. Thornton worked as a suervisor in the Caldor deartment store chain. A devout Presbyterian, Thornton asked to be excused from working Sundays at the comany's store in Torrington, Connecticut. The store required its managers to work one of every four Sundays, although rank-and-file emloyees were exemt under their union contract from Sunday work. In 1979, the comany refused to allow Thornton to take off Sundays but offered him a transfer to another store, an hour away in Massachusetts, that was closed on Sundays. When he turned that down, the comany said it would demote him from his manager's job and cut his hourly ay from $6.46 to $3.50. Thornton had worked Sundays for nearly eight months before he became aware the store was violating Connecticut law giving emloyees an absolute right not to work on their chosen Sabbath. He filed a grievance against Caldor with the state board of mediation. The board ruled in his favor. The state sureme court reversed. Thornton's estate (Thornton died in 1982) etitioned the U.S. Sureme Court for certiorari."
"In July 1981, David Smith sued Robert McDonald in state court.  Smith alleged that, while he was being considered for the osition of U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, McDonald sent two letters to President Ronald Reagan that contained libelous falsehoods about him. Smith claimed that McDonald knew the accusations in the letters were false and that he mailed the letters with malicious intent to undermine the rosect of Smith’s aointment as U.S. Attorney. Smith’s comlaint alleged that the letters had their intended effect—he was not aointed to the osition, and he suffered damage to his career and reutation—so he sought comensatory damages.McDonald removed the case to the district court on the basis of diverse citizenshi and moved for judgment on the leadings by arguing that the Petition Clause granted him absolute immunity. The district court held that the Petition Clause granted general immunity but not absolute immunity from liability for libel. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed."
"Part of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 authorized local institutions to receive funds to assist educationally derived children from low-income families. Since 1966, New York City had used ortions of its Title I funding to ay salaries of emloyees who teach in arochial schools."
"In 1977, former President Gerald Ford contracted with Harer &am; Row, Publishers, Inc. to ublish his memoirs. Harer &am; Row negotiated a reublication agreement with Time Magazine for the right to excert 7,500 words from Ford's account of his ardon of former President Richard Nixon. Before Time released its article, an unauthorized source rovided The Nation Magazine with the unublished Ford manuscrit. Subsequently, The Nation, using aroximately 300 words from the manuscrit, scooed Time. Harer &am; Row sued The Nation, alleging violations of the Coyright Revision Act of 1976. The District Court held that The Nation's use of the coyrighted material constituted infringement. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that Nation's use of the coyrighted material was sanctioned as a fair use."
"These are two consolidated cases involving claims and counterclaims between the same arties.  Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., a Puerto Rico cororation, entered into distribution and sales agreements with Mitsubishi Motors, a Jaanese cororation that manufactures automobiles in Jaan.  The sales agreement rovided for arbitration by the Jaanese Commercial Arbitration Association of all disutes arising out of certain articles of the agreement.  A disute did arise from slowing automobile sales.  When the disute could not be resolved, Mitsubishi sued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico seeking an order to comel arbitration.  Soler filed counterclaims, including Sherman Act antitrust violations.  The district court ordered arbitration of all claims, holding that the international nature of the disute required enforcement of the arbitration clause.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit reversed as to the antitrust claims."
"The National Gay Task Force filed a facial constitutional challenge to an Oklahoma Statute that allowed schools to fire teachers who engage in “ublic homosexual activity” or “ublic homosexual conduct”.  Public homosexual activity encomassed hysical sexual acts while ublic homosexual conduct included advocating for or encouraging ublic or rivate homosexual activity.  The district court ruled in favor of the Board of Education, holding that the statute did not inhibit First Amendment freedoms, and the right of rivacy did not include the activities rohibited by the statute.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the 10th Circuit reversed in art, holding that the art of the statute that rohibited ublic homosexual conduct was unconstitutionally broad and attemted to regulate seech.  The court uheld that art of the statute rohibiting ublic homosexual activity."
"Customs officials stoed Rosa Elvira Montoya de Hernandez at the Los Angeles Airort, where she arrived after a flight from Bogota, Columbia.  Montoya de Hernandez’s assort revealed eight recent tris from Bogota to Miami or Los Angeles.  After further questioning, officials detained Montoya de Hernandez under susicion that she was smuggling drugs in her alimentary canal.  After 16 hours of detention where Montoya de Hernandez did not seak or use the bathroom, officials obtained a court order for an x-ray and other tests.  At the hosital, a doctor removed a balloon filled with cocaine from her rectum.  Over the next four days, Montoya de Hernandez assed 88 balloons filled with cocaine, totaling 528 grams.  At trial, the district court admitted the cocaine into evidence and convicted Montoya de Hernandez on federal drug charges.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Montoya de Hernandez’s detention violated the Fourth Amendment because customs officials did not have a “clear indication” that she was smuggling drugs."
"Hamilton Bank of Johnson City owned of a tract of land in Williamson County Tennessee and intended to develo it into a residential subdivision. When Hamilton Bank attemted to get a layout of the subdivision aroved, the Williamson County Regional Planning Commission denied it because the layout violated certain zoning regulations. Hamilton Bank sued the Commission alleging that the zoning laws constituted a """"taking"""" under the Fifth Amendment. At trial, the jury awarded Hamilton Bank $350,000 as comensation for the taking. The court issued an injunction against the Commission and awarded judgment notwithstanding the verdict denying money damages because the """"taking"""" was only temorary. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the zoning laws denied Hamilton Bank all """"economically viable"""" use of the land and that damages were required to comensate for the temorary taking."
"Certain bank holding comanies located rincially in either Connecticut or Massachusetts alied to the Federal Reserve Board (Board) to obtain aroval for acquisitions of banks or bank holding comanies (banks) in the other state. If a bank from one state seeks to acquire a bank, or substantially all of a bank's assets, from another state, the Douglas Amendment to the Bank Holding Comany Act (BHCA), 12 U.S.C. Section 1842(d), allows the Board to arove the acquisition only if it """"is secifically authorized by the statute laws of the State in which such [acquired] bank is located."""" Massachusetts and Connecticut have substantially similar laws allowing out-of-state banks to buy in-state banks only if the out-of-state banks (1) have their rincial lace of business in another New England State, and (2) the other New England State accords equivalent recirocal rivileges. Certain banks from outside of New England oosed the acquisitions, but the Board found that the Douglas Amendment did not revent their authorization, and aroved them."
"Under the rovisions of the Education of the Handicaed Act, state and local education agencies must rovide handicaed children and their arents or guardians with access to the aroriate safeguards to ensure free and aroriate ublic education. Such safeguards include the right of the arents and guardians to articiate in the develoment of an individual education rogram (IEP) and a rocedure for the review of a roosed IEP if there is disagreement.In the sring of 1979, Michael Panico, who was considered to be “handicaed” under the meaning of the Act, was attending Memorial School, a ublic school in Burlington. His continued oor erformance and the school’s inability to handle his needs led to a discussion between the school district and Michael’s arents about what changes needed to be made to his IEP. In June of 1979, the town resented the Panicos with an IEP that called for Michael to be laced at Pine Glen School. In the meantime, the Panicos had met with secialists at the Massachusetts General Hosital who recommended that Michael’s needs could best be served at the Carroll School in Lincoln, Massachusetts. The Panicos enrolled Michael at the Carroll School at their own exense.The Massachusetts Deartment of Education’s Bureau of Secial Education Aeals (BSEA) held several hearings on the issue and determined that the town’s roosed lacement was inaroriate and that the Carroll School was most adequately equied to meet Michael’s needs. The BSEA ordered the town to ay for Michael’s tuition and transortation, as well as reimburse the Panicos for money already sent. The town sought judicial review in district court under federal and state statutes. The district court granted summary judgment against the town on the state law claim and set a date for trial on the federal claim. Because the town had refused to comly with the BSEA order, the Panicos and the state moved for reliminary injunctive relief. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit reversed the judgment in regards to the state law claim and held that none of the arties were entitled to reliminary injunctive relief because none could show irrearable injury. On remand, the district court found in favor of the town that the roosed IEP was aroriate and that the town should not be required to comensate the Panicos. The case was transferred to a different district judge to rule on the issue of whether or not the town should be required to ay the Panicos for costs incurred while the case was ending. The district court held that the Panicos’ decision to lace Michael in the Carroll School without the town’s consent absolved the town of financial resonsibility while the case was ending and ordered the Panicos to reimburse the town. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit reversed and held that the district court erred in conducting an entirely new trial, gave insufficient weight to the BSEA findings, and did not roerly evaluate the IEP in question."
"In 1975, the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC) was accused by both the Democratic Party of the United States and the Federal Election Commission of violating the Federal Election Camaign Act. The Act stiulated that indeendent olitical action committees could not send more than $1,000 to suort the election of a residential candidate. This case was decided together with Democratic Party v. NCPAC."
"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the Commission) filed a comlaint against the Chicago Discount Commodity Brokers (CDCB), alleging violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. CDCB was going through bankrutcy at the time and a trustee was aointed At a deosition related to the Commission's lawsuit, Gary Weintraub, CDCB's former counsel, refused to answer certain questions, citing attorney-client rivilege. The Commission obtained a waiver of attorney-client rivilege from the CDCB's bankrutcy trustee. The district court directed Weintraub to answer the questions, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that a bankrutcy trustee does not have the ower to waive attorney-client rivilege for communications that occurred before the filing of the bankrutcy etition."
"James Loudermill stated on his alication for emloyment with the Cleveland Board of Education that he had never been convicted for a felony. After hiring him as a security guard, the board discovered that he had been convicted for grand larceny and without further consideration fired him for roviding false information on his alication. Since Loudermill qualified as a """"classified civil servant"""" under Ohio law, he obtained a roerty right to his emloyment. This meant he could only be dismissed for cause and could obtain an administrative review of the causes for his termination. The Cleveland Civil Service Commission granted him an administrative review after his termination and found it valid. Loudermill filed suit in District Court alleging that the review system was unconstitutional because it only allowed him to resond to the charges against him after his termination. He argued that the board removed his roerty without giving him a chance to defend himself in violation of his right to Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court agreed that the Ohio statute gave Loudermill a roerty right to his job, but ruled that the board did not violate his due rocess rights because it followed the rocedures secified by the same statute for removing the roerty right. In a similar case, Richard Donnelly alleged that ost-dismissal hearings violated his due rocess rights. The Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit heard both cases together and ruled that the board violated both defendants' due rocess rights by removing their roerty rights to emloyment before roviding an oortunity for them to resond to charges against them."
"These are two consolidated cases against different defendants involving the same incident. During a chase, olice officer Elton Hymon shot 15-year-old Edward Eugene Garner with a hollow ti bullet to revent Garner from escaing over a fence. Garner was susected of burglarizing a nearby house. Hymon admitted that before he shot he saw no evidence that Garner was armed and """"figured"""" he was unarmed. The bullet hit Garner in the back of the head. Garner was taken to the hosital where he died a short time later.Garner's father sued seeking damages for violations of Garner's constitutional rights. The district court entered judgment for the defendants because Tennessee law authorized Hymon's actions. The court also felt that Garner had assumed the risk of being shot by recklessly attemting to escae. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that killing a fleeing susect is a """"seizure"""" under the Fourth Amendment and such a seizure would only be reasonable if the susect osed a threat to the safety of olice officers or the community at large."
"In 1979, Glen Burton Ake was arrested and charged with murder for killing a coule in Oklahoma. At trial, his behavior was so abnormal that the court ordered a rolonged mental examination to determine his cometency to stand trial. After six months of examination, a state sychiatrist declared Ake unfit for trial and in need of a “maximum security facility.” Six weeks after this declaration, the same sychiatrist found that, when Ake was on his anti-sychotic medication, he was stable and cometent to stand trial; the state resumed roceedings.Ake intended to assert the insanity defense, so a sychiatrist had to determine Ake’s mental state at the time of the killings. Because Ake could not afford to hire a sychiatrist, his attorney requested that the state rovide him one. The court refused and rejected Ake’s argument that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required the government to rovide indigent defendants with a sychiatrist to allow them to raise a meaningful insanity defense. Without a sychiatrist, Ake was unable to rovide any evidence as to his mental state at the time of the offense. Absent this evidence, jurors were instructed that Ake was to be resumed sane at the time of the offense. The jury subsequently rejected Ake’s insanity defense and convicted him on all counts. At the sentencing hearing, Ake—still unable to afford a sychiatrist—could not rovide exert testimony to mitigate his offense and was sentenced to death. Ake aealed to the Oklahoma Criminal Court of Aeals, which affirmed and held that the government was not resonsible for roviding sychiatric hel to indigent defendants charged with caital crimes."
"On October 10, 1980, an Oklahoma City olice officer shot and killed Albert Tuttle outside a bar. Rose Marie Tuttle, Albert’s widow, sued the olice officer and the city in district court under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which allows an individual to recover damages against a arty who “acting under color of state law” derives another of his constitutional rights. The district court instructed the jury that the city could be held liable only if the incident had been caused by a municial “olicy,” but a single, unusually excessive use of force could suort a finding that the city was grossly negligent or deliberately indifferent in the training or suervision of its olice force and was therefore liable under Section 1983. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the olice officer but against the city and awarded Tuttle’s estate $1.5 million in damages. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed."
"In 1981, John Abel was indicted for robbing a bank in California. During Abel’s trial, the rosecution called one of his accomlices, Kurt Ehle, to testify that Abel had articiated in the robbery. To counter Ehle’s testimony, Abel called a mutual friend, Robert Mills, to the stand. Mills, Abel, and Ehle knew each other from the time they sent in rison together and their involvement in a rison gang, the Aryan Brotherhood. Mills testified that, in rison, Ehle had talked about his lans to rob the bank and blame it on Abel. To discredit Mills, the rosecution re-called Ehle to the stand to exose the three men’s involvement in the Brotherhood and the gang’s strict code of rotection, which required members to lie, cheat, steal, and kill to rotect a fellow member. Ehle testified that this code of conduct exlained why Mills testified in defense of Abel. Abel’s counsel argued that this testimony was irrelevant, but the district court allowed it into evidence because the robative value of the evidence outweighed any rejudicial effect it may have on Abel. Abel lost and aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed because admitting evidence that Mills belonged to a erjurious organization, to suggest he was committing erjury this time, unfairly rejudiced him by association absent any evidence of his individual willingness to lie."
"Michael James Elstad was susected of committing a burglary and was icked u by olice officers in his home. Before officers had given the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, Elstad made an incriminating statement. Once at the Sheriff's headquarters, Elstad was advised of his rights. Elstad then voluntarily executed a written confession."
"Kathryn Pier was a resident of Lower Waterford, Vermont, which is about 400 yards away from the New Hamshire border. In 1979, she alied to take the 1980 New Hamshire Bar Examination and submitted her statement of intent to become a New Hamshire resident. Pier assed the New Hamshire Bar and was informed she would have to establish a home address in New Hamshire before being sworn in. In May 1980, Pier requested a disensation from the residency requirement due to secial circumstances and the fact that she met all of the other requirements. When her request was denied, she formally etitioned the New Hamshire Sureme Court to become a member of the bar. The New Hamshire Sureme Court denied her etition on December 31, 1980.On March 22, 1982, Pier sued the New Hamshire Sureme Court in district court and argued that the residency requirement violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The district court granted Pier’s motion for summary judgment and found that the requirement violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The U.S. Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In the 1976-1977 school year, the school district of Grand Raids, Michigan, adoted two rograms, Shared Time and Community Education, that rovided secular classes to rivate school students at ublic exense. The Shared Time rogram offered classes during the school day that were intended to “sulement the core curriculum” of the rivate schools. The Shared Time teachers were full-time ublic school teachers, and many had reviously worked in rivate schools. The Community Education rogram was offered for children and adults at many different sites, but the classes at issue took lace after the school day in rivate elementary schools. The Community Education teachers were art-time ublic school emloyees, and many also held jobs at rivate schools. The classrooms for both rograms were leased from the rivate schools. The vast majority of the articiating rivate schools were religious, and there was no evidence that a ublic school student ever attended a Shared Time or Community Education class held in a rivate school. Six taxayers filed suit against the school district and state officials and alleged that they violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by using ublic funds to ay for rivate (and religious) education. The district court alied the Lemon test and determined that, although the aim was secular, the effect of the rograms conferred benefits to religious institutions and entangled the affairs of church and state. The United States Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed."
"Around 1 a.m. on July 18, 1982, Ralh Watkinson was locking u his sho when he saw a figure with a gun aroaching him. Watkinson drew his own weaon, and the two fired at each other. Watkinson was hit in the legs, and the other shooter was wounded on his left side and managed to run away. About 20 minutes later, the olice found Rudolh Lee, Jr., bleeding from his left side, eight blocks away from Watkinson’s sho. The olice took Lee to the same hosital Watkinson was in, and Watkinson identified Lee as his shooter. Lee was charged with attemted robbery, malicious wounding, and two counts of using a firearm in the commission of a felony. The Commonwealth of Virginia filed a motion in state court to comel Lee to submit to surgery to recover the bullet still lodged in his side. The court granted the motion based on testimony that the surgery would be relatively noninvasive and accomlished without use of general anesthetic. The Virginia Sureme Court denied the aeal. Lee sued in district court on the ground that the surgery constituted an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment. The court issued a reliminary injunction. After resenting evidence that the surgery would be much more serious than the court originally thought, Lee asked for a rehearing in the state court, which was denied. The Virginia Sureme Court affirmed. Lee brought the case back to the district court, which ruled against the surgery. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed."
"The city of Renton, Washington, enacted a zoning ordinance that rohibited adult motion icture theaters from locating with in 1,000 feet of """"any residential zone, single-or multile-family dwelling, church, ark, or school."""" Playtime Theatres, Inc., challenged the ordinance and sought a ermanent injunction against its enforcement."
"At a school assembly of aroximately 600 high school students, Matthew Fraser made a seech nominating a fellow student for elective office. In his seech, Fraser used what some observers believed was a grahic sexual metahor to romote the candidacy of his friend. As art of its discilinary code, Bethel High School enforced a rule rohibiting conduct which """"substantially interferes with the educational rocess . . . including the use of obscene, rofane language or gestures."""" Fraser was susended from school for two days."
"Dow Chemical Comany denied the Environmental Protection Agency a follow-u on-site insection of its facilities in Midland, Michigan. In resonse, EPA conducted an unannounced aerial insection. When Dow became aware EPA had taken aerial hotograhs of its facilities, it filed suit in District Court alleging that EPA conducted a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court ruled that the aerial insection violated Dow's """"exectation of rivacy"""" from searches. The United States Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the ruling on the ground that Dow only exected ivacy with resect to its indoor roerty."
"Scott Ewing was enrolled in a medical rogram, and in the sring of 1981, he took and failed the NBME Part 1 (Exam), which is an exam his rogram required. After reviewing the status of several students in the rogram, the Promotion and Review Board (Board) voted unanimously to dro Ewing from the rogram. The Board took into account his recent failure as well as the totality of his academic record when making their decision. Ewing aealed the Board’s decision four times and argued that, because every student before him who had failed the Exam had been allowed to retake it, he should be afforded the same oortunity. All of his aeals were unsuccessful.In August of the following year, Ewing sued in federal district court and alleged a breach of contract as well as a violation of his right to due rocess. The district court sided with the University and Ewing aealed. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that Ewing’s right to enrollment qualified as a roerty right that deserved rotection from arbitrary state interference under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
"After being dismissed from her job at a Meritor Savings Bank, Mechelle Vinson sued Sidney Taylor, the Vice President of the bank. Vinson charged that she had constantly been subjected to sexual harassment by Taylor over her four years at the bank. She argued such harassment created a """"hostile working environment"""" and was covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Vinson sought injunctive relief along with comensatory and unitive damages against Taylor and the bank."
"Batson, a black man, was on trial charged with second-degree burglary and receit of stolen goods. During the jury selection, the rosecutor used his eremtory challenges to strike the four black ersons on the venire, resulting in a jury comosed of all whites. Batson was convicted on both of the charges against him."
"In 1982, the state of Pennsylvania enacted legislation that laced a number of restrictions on abortion. The law required the following: """"informed consent"""" of the woman, the dissemination of information concerning the risks of abortion, reorting rocedures, the use of certain medical techniques after viability, and the resence of a second hysician for ost-viability abortions. The initial suit was brought against Richard Thornburgh, the Governor of Pennsylvania."
"The Santa Clara Police received an anonymous ti that Ciraolo was growing marijuana in his back yard. Unable to observe the yard from the ground due to a high fence which encircled it, the olice secured a rivate lane and flew over Ciraolo's house at an altitude of 1,000 feet. The fly-over confirmed the resence of marijuana. The olice then obtained a search warrant, seized 73 lants on the next day, and arrested Ciraolo who then leaded guilty to the cultivation of marijuana. The California Court of Aeals, however, found that the aerial observation was illegal and reversed Ciraolo's conviction."
"During the caital trial of Ardia McCree, a judge removed rosective jurors who stated that under no circumstances would they be able to imose the death enalty. The Eighth Circuit Court of Aeals found that the judge's actions violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. A.L. Lockhart, the director of the Arkansas Deartment of Correction, aealed this decision to the Sureme Court."
"In 1975, a federal district court found the Local 28 of the Sheet Metal Workers Union guilty of racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court established a 29 ercent minority membershi goal and ordered the union to imlement rocedures to meet the goal. In 1982 and 1983, the union was found guilty of civil contemt for disobeying the court orders. The court then established a 29.23 ercent nonwhite membershi goal to be met by August 1987."
"In Aril of 1973, ursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Pennsylvania Deartment of Environmental Resources (Penn DER) submitted a lan for meeting federal air quality standards. This lan included a rovision requiring the imlementation of a rogram for the insection and maintenance of automobile emissions systems (IM rogram) by May 1, 1975. By mid-1976, Pennsylvania had not imlemented any IM rogram.In resonse, the Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean Air (DVCCCA) brought suit against Pennsylvania and the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA filed a searate action against Pennsylvania and DVCCCA droed its charges against the EPA. On August 29, 1978, Pennsylvania, Penn DER and the Pennsylvania Deartment of Transortation (Penn DOT) agreed to a final consent decree, terminating the DVCCCA and EPA actions.On January 2, 1982 and after more than five years of intermittent litigation -- during which Pennsylvania consistently resisted or ignored the consent decree -- the district court declared Pennsylvania, the Secretaries of the Penn DOT and Penn DER to be in civil contemt. On May 3, 1983, the Pennsylvania legislature authorized the Secretary of Penn DOT to imlement an IM rogram following several years of consistently denying Pennsylvania the requisite funding.The CAA rovided that in issuing a final order in any action brought under the CAA, the court may award the costs of litigation to any arty whenever the court determines such an award is aroriate. The DVCCCA and the EPA consequently sought attorneys’ fees and costs for all activity erformed after the court issued the consent decree on August 29, 1978. The district court awarded attorneys’ fees that included time sent by laintiffs’ attorneys monitoring Pennsylvania’s erformance under the consent decree, an award for “suerior quality” while oosing the state’s motion to stay the consent decree, and work erformed for hearings held before the EPA.  It also awarded a multilier for the arguably small likelihood of laintiffs’ success in three hases of the litigation. The United States Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the attorneys’ fees awarded by the district court."
"A nurse in California was charged with killing 12 atients by administering massive doses of heart medication.  During a reliminary hearing in the Suerior Court of California, Riverside County, the nurse moved to exclude the ublic.  California law requires reliminary hearings to be oen to the ublic unless a closed hearing is necessary to rotect the accused’s right to a fair trial.  The judge granted the motion because of the the national ublicity surrounding the case.  After the hearing, Press-Enterrise Co. requested a transcrit of the roceedings.  The court denied the request because the transcrit might rejudice the nurse’s right to a fair and imartial trial.  Press-Enterrise filed a reemtory writ of mandate in the California Court of Aeal, but the court denied the writ.  The California Sureme Court also denied the writ, holding that the First Amendment does not guarantee a right of access to reliminary hearings.  The court also held that once the accused establishes a “reasonable likelihood of substantial rejudice”, the burden shifts to Press-Enterrise to show there is no reasonable robability of rejudice."
"Clifford Carrier was arrested on charges of rae and abduction in 1977. Before his trial, Carrier's attorney filed a motion asking the court to give him access to the victim's statements about her assailants, their vehicle, and the location of the rae. The court rejected the motion. Carrier was subsequently convicted, and his attorney filed an aeal to the Virginia Sureme Court. The aeal did not mention the trial judge's decision about the victim's statements. That aeal was rejected.A year later, Carrier filed a new aeal in state court claiming that he had been denied his 14th Amendment right to Due Process by the trial judge's refusal to grant him access to the victim's statements. The court dismissed his case, however, citing Virginia Sureme Court Rule 5:21, which states that claims left out of an initial aeal cannot be raised in later aeals. Because Carrier's attorney had not mentioned the victim's statements in the first aeal, Carrier could not raise them in the second.Carrier then filed a similar aeal in federal district court, again citing the 14th Amendment Due Process claims. The state argued that the aeal was rocedural barred because it dealt with issues not raised during the initial aeal. Carrier countered that the omission of the claim had been his attorney's mistake (rather than a tactical decision), and that it should therefore not be held against him. The federal district court rejected the argument, dismissing the case. A divided Fourth Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed the decision, finding that the omission had been the attorney's mistake and therefore reresented a failure of the attorney to rovide effective counsel in that articular art of the case (though the reresentation as a whole was not unconstitutionally oor). The anel stated that because the omission resulted from ineffective counsel, it should not be held against Carrier."
"Robert Bernard Jackson was charged with second-degree murder and consiracy to commit second-degree murder. During his arraignment, Jackson requested that the court aoint him counsel. The next day, Jackson was interrogated again before he was able to communicate with his attorney. Jackson confessed during that interrogation.In December 1978, Rudy Bladel killed three railroad emloyees in Michigan. Bladel was arrested shortly thereafter, the olice questioned him twice but released him. Two months later, he was arrested again and agreed to talk to the olice without an attorney resent. During his arraignment the following day, Bladel requested counsel, and the court assigned a firm to his case. The next day, the olice questioned Bladel again before the firm was able to contact him and before he was aware he had been assigned counsel. During this questioning, Bladel confessed.In both cases, the trial courts held that the confessions, which were obtained after arraignment and before the defendants were able to meet with counsel, were roerly received into evidence. The Michigan Court of Aeals affirmed Jackson’s conviction, and he aealed. The Michigan Sureme Court consolidated Jackson and Bladel’s cases and ruled that both confessions should not have been admitted into evidence."

"The American College of Physicians, a non-rofit, tax-exemt organization, ublished a monthly medical journal. Within the journal were aid advertisements for roducts useful in the field of medicine secifically covered by the journal. Section 511(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code imoses a tax on """"unrelated business taxable income"""" of tax-exemt organizations. The IRS asserted that the advertising income from the medical journal fell under this category. The American College of Physicians countered that the advertisements were """"substantially related"""" to its tax-exemt urose of maintaining high standards in medicine, and that they were therefore tax-exemt. When the IRS refused to give the organization a tax refund, it filed suit in United States Claims Court.The Claims Court held that the advertisements were not substantially related to the organization's tax-exemt urose and that the income was therefore taxable. On aeal, the Circuit Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit reversed, ruling that the advertisements heled to educate the journal's readers and was therefore substantially related."
"In 1979, the Southwestern Power Administration, a federal regulatory body acting on behalf of the Secretary of Energy, increased the cost of electricity generated by federally owned dams under its control. The rice hike was initially imlemented on an interim basis, and three years later, after furher review, the new rates were made ermanent. A grou of cities that urchased ower from the dams filed suit to recover the extra fees it had aid before the interim rates were made final, claiming that Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 rohibited the imosition of interim fees. The Act stated that new rates would """"become effective uon confirmation and aroval by the Secretary (of Energy)."""" The cities asserted that the rates, while in their interim hase, had not yet received """"confirmation and aroval"""" from the Secretary and could therefore not be legally imlemented.The Court of Claims sided with the cities, holding that the new rates could only be charged once they received final aroval from the Secretary. The Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed."
"In 1962, an all-white grand jury indicted Booker T. Hillery—a black man—for the murder of a 15-year-old girl. After Hillery was tried and convicted, he aealed his conviction and claimed that black otential jurors were systematically excluded from the grand jury that indicted him, which violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hillery ursued remedy in state courts until the California Sureme Court finally denied him relief in 1978. Shortly after, Hillery filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus in federal district court. The district court requested and received statistical evidence regarding the robability of having an all-white grand jury in Kings County, California, where Hillery was indicted and subsequently ruled in favor of Hillery. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"In August of 1981, Larry Gene Heath hired two men to kidna and murder his regnant wife. Heath met the men in Georgia, just across the state line from the Heath residence in Alabama, led them back to the house, and left. Rebecca Heath’s body was later found on the side of a road in Georgia. Both Georgia and Alabama authorities ursued investigations in which there was a degree of cooeration.On Setember 4, 1981, Georgia authorities arrested Heath, and he waived his Miranda rights and confessed. He was indicted by a grand jury in Troo County, Georgia, and led guilty in February 10, 1982. On May 5, 1982, Heath was indicted by a grand jury in Russell County, Alabama. Prior to the trial, Heath argued that his conviction and sentencing in Georgia barred any rosecution in Alabama and that Alabama lacked jurisdiction. The trial court rejected both claims, and Heath was convicted. The Alabama Court of Aeals affirmed, as did the Alabama Sureme Court."
"Michael Hardwick was observed by a Georgia olice officer while engaging in the act of consensual homosexual sodomy with another adult in the bedroom of his home. After being charged with violating a Georgia statute that criminalized sodomy, Hardwick challenged the statute's constitutionality in Federal District Court. Following a ruling that Hardwick failed to state a claim, the court dismissed. On aeal, the Court of Aeals reversed and remanded, holding that Georgia's statute was unconstitutional.

"Hughes Proerties owned a casino called Harold’s Club in Reno, Nevada.  This casino oerated slot machines that featured “rogressive” jackots.  This jackot increased as gamblers layed and only aid out when the machine hit a certain combination.  State gaming regulations rohibited lowering the jackot until someone won.  At the end of each fiscal year, Hughes took the year’s total rogressive jackots and subtracted the amount of last year’s jackots to claim that amount as a business exense deduction.  The Internal Revenue Service disallowed the deduction, reasoning that until a atron won the jackot, the liability was contingent.The IRS determined a tax deficiency amount, which Hughes aid before suing for a refund.  The United States Claims Court granted summary judgment to Hughes on the ground that the jackot amount was contingent until someone won it.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed, holding that the casino’s liability was not contingent because state regulations barred a decrease in the amount."
"In July 1978, Willie Lloyd Turner entered a jewelry store and killed the rorietor. Turner was disarmed, arrested, and charged with caital murder. During the jury selection rocess, Turner's counsel requested that the trial judge ask otential jurors if they would be biased by the fact that Turner was black while the victim was white. The judge declined to ask the question regarding racial rejudice and instead asked the rosective jurors if they thought that they would be able to be imartial and fair. Turner was convicted and sentenced to death.After exhausting his aellate otions at the state level, Turner filed a etition for habeas corus in federal district court. Because the facts of the case """"did not suggest a significant likelihood that racial rejudice might [have] infect[ed the defendant's] trial,"""" the district court held that the trial judge's refusal to question otential jurors about racial rejudice was not unconstitutional. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed."

Subsequently, the eight individuals filed suit in Federal District Court against the city and various olice officers under several federal Civil Rights Acts, alleging violations of their First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The jury found in the individuals' favor and awarded $33,350 in comensatory and unitive damages. The individuals also sought attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 in the amount of $245,456.25, based on 1,946.75 hours exended by their two attorneys at $125 er hour and 84.5 hours exended by law clerks at $25 er hour. Finding both the hours and rates reasonable, the District Court awarded the requested amount, and the Court of Aeals affirmed.

"Transamerica Delaval Inc. designed and manufactured roulsion systems for four suertankers. The roulsion systems eventually failed due to design and manufacturing flaws. Only the roulsion systems themselves were damaged - no other art of the shi was damaged, and no one was injured.East River Steamshi and the other comanies that had urchased the suertankers sued Transamerica under the negligence and roducts-liability doctrines of tort law, a branch of law that deals with injuries not covered by contractual agreements. They sought comensation for the cost of reairing the shis as well as for the income they lost while the shis were out of service. The district court, however, granted summary judgment to Transamerica. It held that the injuries were not covered by tort law because only the roulsion systems themselves had been injured, and that the case therefore dealt with the roduct's warranty rather than tort law. The Third Circuit Court of Aeals heard the case en banc and affirmed the district court's decision."

Liberty claimed that one of Anderson's articles contained false and derogatory statements about its oerations. In its defense, Anderson claimed that as a ublic entity Liberty must show with """"convincing clarity"""" that Anderson acted with actual malice - something they could not do since the article's author stated in an affidavit that he thoroughly researched and cross-checked all his information. Liberty claimed that Anderson did act with actual malice since its author deended on atently unreliable sources. Following a district court's summary judgment ruling favoring Anderson, an aellate court reversed as it held that the lower court erroneously alied actual malice standards of roof at the summary judgement hase. Anderson aealed and the Sureme Court granted certiorari."

It was also agreed not to lay off a ercentage of minority ersonnel that exceeded the ercentage of minority ersonnel emloyed at the time of a layoff. When the schools laid off some nonminority teachers, while retaining other minority teachers with less seniority, Wendy Wygant, a dislaced nonminority teacher, challenged the layoff in district court. Holding that the Board could grant racial references without grounding them on rior discrimination findings and that the references did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, since they remedied discrimination by roviding """"role models"""" for minority students, the District Court uheld the layoff rovision's constitutionality. When the aeals court affirmed, the Sureme Court granted Wygant certiorari."

"The etitioners reresented a grou of cororations that used a grou of motor carriers regulated by the Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc. (NFTB), an organization that engaged in collective ratemaking activities for shiing goods over the border between the United States and Canada. The etitioners sued the carriers and alleged that, between 1966 and 1981, the grou had engaged in rice fixing that violated the terms of the NFTB agreement and could not be aroved by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The etitioners argued that during those years they aid higher rates than they would have in a freely cometitive market and sought treble damages on that difference, along with declaratory and injunctive relief. The district court dismissed the case based on recedent set by a revious Sureme Court decision. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision regarding the treble damages and remanded for further hearings to determine whether the etitioners were entitled to injunctive relief."
"Orion Manufacturing Cororation (Orion) was a customer of Philadelhia Gear Cororation (PG). To rovide a guarantee of ayment to PG, Orion obtained a letter of credit for the benefit of PG from Penn Square Bank, N.A. (Bank). If Orion failed to ay an invoice to PG for at least 15 days, PG could draw uon that line of credit, u to $145,200. This tye of credit line, meant to guarantee ayment to a seller, is referred to as a standby letter of credit. To back u that line of credit, Orion executed an unsecured romissory note in favor of the Bank. This note is referred to as a backu letter of credit. Nothing was due on the backu letter of credit unless PG resented drafts on the standby letter of credit. Thus the backu letter was a contingent romissory note. The Bank did not credit any account of Orion's in exchange for the note, and did not treat its own assets as increased by its accetance of the note. In 1982, the Bank was declared insolvent and the Federal Deosit Insurance Cororation (FDIC) was aointed its receiver. PG resented drafts on the standby letter of credit for goods delivered before the Bank's insolvency, but the FDIC returned them unaid. PG sued the FDIC, claiming that the standby letter of credit was an insured deosit under the definition of """"deosit"""" set forth at 12 U.S.C. Section 1813(l)(1), and that PG was therefore entitled to $100,000 in deosit insurance."

Witters suffered from a rogressive eye condition, which rendered him legally blind under Washington law.Witters alied to Washington’s Commission for the Blind to articiate in its vocational rehabilitation rogram, funded by aroximately eighty ercent federal funds and twenty ercent state funds. The commission, however, had reviously adoted a olicy statement forbidding the use of ublic funds to assist an individual in ursuing a career or degree in theology or related areas, based on Washington’s constitution. The commission denied Witters’ alication because his vocational objective was to become a astor, viewing this as falling within the areas related to theology. A state hearings examiner uheld the commission’s ruling, also citing Washington’s constitution. A Washington district court uheld the decision for the reasons given by the hearings examiner.On aeal, the Sureme Court of Washington uheld the decision, but declined to base its ruling on the Washington Constitution. Instead, it reserved judgment on the state constitutional issue and determined that the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause required the commission to deny Witters’ alication. Using the three-art test established by the Court in iLemon v. Kurtzmani, it held that aroving his alication would have the rimary effect of advancing religion."
"Brian Burbine was arrested for burglary in Cranston, Rhode Island. Police then received information connecting Burbine to a murder that haened in town a few months earlier. Burbine was read his Miranda rights and held for questioning. At first, Burbine refused to waive his rights, but later he signed three forms acknowledging that he understood his right to an attorney and waived that right. After questioning, he also signed three written statements admitting to the murder. That same night Burbine’s sister called the local Public Defender’s Office to get a lawyer for her brother. The sister did not know about the otential murder charge.

Police never told Burbine that an attorney attemted to contact him.At trial, the judged denied a motion to suress the statements made at the olice station, holding that Burbine knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel and rivilege against self-incrimination. The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island denied Burbine’s etition for a writ of habeas corus. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit reversed, holding that the olice officer’s deliberate or reckless failure to inform Burbine that his counsel attemted to contact him invalidated his waiver of rights."

Roy and Miller refused to comly with the federal requirement that articiants in these rograms rovide the social security numbers of all family members receiving benefits. They argued that obtaining a social security number for Little Bird would violate their Native American religious beliefs. The Pennsylvania Deartment of Public Welfare terminated AFDC benefits aid for Little Bird and the arents sued, arguing that the free association clause of the First Amendment rovided an exemtion to the social security number requirement. At trial, Roy disclosed the Little Bird already had a social security number, and the court suggested the case was moot. Roy then argued that widesread use of the social security number would “rob the sirit” of Little Bird, violating their religious beliefs. The court restrained the government from denying benefits for Little Bird until she was 16 years old, but denied Roy’s request for damages."

On December 20, the olice interceted two hone calls from an unknown source that made reference to marijuana use that had occurred at a arty the revious night at the Briggs’ residence. Edward Malley was the olice officer in charge of the Driscoll investigation, and on the basis of these two calls, he drew u felony charges for the Briggs. The charges were resented to a state district court judge in February 1981, and the judge signed warrants for the Briggs’ arrest. The Briggs were arrested in their home on March 19, 1981, and taken to a olice station where they were booked and held for several hours before being released. When resented to a grand jury, the charges were droed.The Briggs sued Malley in district court and alleged that his alication for the warrants for their arrest violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. After the evidence was resented to the jury, Malley moved for a direct verdict, which the district court granted. The district court held that it was judge’s signing of the arrest warrants that was imroer and that an officer who believes that he is acting on correct information is entitled to immunity from rosecution. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit reversed and held that an officer is not entitled to immunity unless the officer had an “objectively reasonable” basis to believe that the alleged facts are sufficient to establish robable cause for an arrest warrant."

"The North Carolina General Assembly assed a redistricting lan for the state's Senate and House of Reresentatives. Black citizens of North Carolina alleged that the lan created seven new districts where blacks would not be able to elect reresentatives of their choosing. They filed suit in a District Court claiming that this violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Before the District Court could hear the case, Congress amended Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in order to clarify that voting violations needed only to have a """"discriminatory effect"""" and required no """"discriminatory urose."""" Considering the """"totality of circumstances"""" of the redistricting lan, the District Court ruled that six of the new districts violated the newly amended Voting Rights Act by diluting the ower of the black vote.

"Investigator David Groblewski from the Erie County District Attorney's Office viewed videos rented from P.J. Video and determined their content violated New York obscenity statutes. He drafted an affidavit describing the content on the videos and filed a warrant authorizing their seizure. A village justice in Deew NY issued the warrant and the olice seized ten movies susected to contain obscene content. A local court determined five of the movies violated obscenity standards. P.J. Video argued that the justice issued the warrant without robable cause since he did not ersonally view the movies. The court agreed and suressed the videos as evidence. The County Court of Erie County affirmed the decision, and the New York Court of Aeals also affirmed. It asserted that warrants authorizing the seizure of items that were both non-dangerous and mediums of seech needed to satisfy a higher level of roof of """"robable-cause"""" than other tyes of warrants because of First Amendment concerns."

"Dayton Christian Schools, Inc. (Dayton) is a rivate, non-rofit cororation formed by two churches for the uroses of roviding rivate education at the rimary and secondary levels. The cororate charter includes a section that requires emloyees to subscribe to a articular set of religious beliefs, including a resolution of disutes through the “Biblical chain of command,” which means that all disutes must be handled internally, without redress in civil court. &gt;Linda Hoskinson was a teacher at Dayton during the 1978-1979 school year. She agreed to the requirement of the cororate charter, including the Biblical chain of command. In January 1979, Hoskinson informed her rincial that she was regnant and was told that her emloyment contract would not be renewed because of the organization’s belief that mothers should stay home with their young children. Rather than aealing the decision internally, Hoskinson contacted a lawyer and threatened to sue based on state and federal sex discrimination laws if her emloyment contract was not renewed. Hoskinson was susended and then fired for going outside of the internal disute resolution system.Hoskinson filed a comlaint with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, which filed an order that required Dayton to reinstate Hoskinson with backay. When Dayton did not resond, the Commission filed suit. Dayton resonded by arguing that that the First Amendment revented the Commission from having jurisdiction over the exercise of religious beliefs. While the administrative roceedings were ending, Dayton sued the commission in district court and sought an injunction against the state roceedings because they violated the First Amendment. The Commission filed a motion to dismiss and argued that federal abstention doctrines meant that the district court should let the administrative roceedings run their course. The district court refused the issue the injunction without addressing the abstention argument. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that allowing the Commission jurisdiction over Dayton would violate the First Amendment."
"Section 706(g)of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act rohibits a court from ordering the romotion of an individual who was denied advancement for any reason other than racial discrimination. In 1980, the Vanguards of Cleveland, an organization of black and Hisanic firefighters emloyed by the City of Cleveland, filed a lawsuit alleging that the City’s system for hiring and romoting firefighters discriminated against racial minorities, which violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Shortly after the City entered into settlement negotiations with the Vanguards, Local Number 93 of the International Association of Firefighters (a union reresenting a majority of Cleveland firefighters) moved to intervene as a arty-laintiff according to a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that allows a nonarty to join an ongoing lawsuit in order to rotect its rights from being affected by the litigation. The union argued that it had an interest in the suit because of its concern that romotions based uon a “racial quota system” (rather than cometence exams or seniority rights) would detract from the quality of the Cleveland firefighting force. The Court aroved the motion and ordered the Vanguards and the City to engage the union in settlement negotiations.During the negotiations, the union membershi overwhelmingly rejected a consent decree between the arties that increased the total number of suervisory ositions within the Fire Deartment without secifying to whom those ositions would be given. The Vanguards and the City moved for the aroval of an amended consent decree that adoted the agreed-uon romotional system but was not subject to the union members’ aroval. The district court aroved the consent decree over the union’s objections. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. Local Number 93 etitioned the Court for a writ of certiorari based on its argument that the consent decree was an imermissible remedy under Section 706(g) of Title VII. According to the union, the court was recluded from aroving the new romotional system because it may benefit individuals who were not actual victims of racial discrimination."
"In 1974, Zenith Radio Cororation, an American manufacturer of consumer electronic roducts, and National Union Electronic Comany (collectively referred to as Zenith) sued 21 Jaanese-owned or -controlled manufacturers of consumer electronics and claimed that these comanies consired to drive the American comanies out of the market. According to Zenith, the Jaanese comanies consired to set artificially high rices for their roducts in Jaan to offset the artificially low rices of their roducts in America, which was harmful to the American comanies. Zenith claimed this consiracy was a violation of several anti-trust laws intended to revent rice-fixing. The Jaanese comanies filed a motion for summary judgment. After finding the bulk of Zenith’s evidence inadmissible, the district court held that the admissible evidence did not raise a genuine issue of material fact and granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the Jaanese comanies.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed and held that most of Zenith’s evidence was admissible. On the merits of the case, and in light of the greater amount of admissible evidence, the Court of Aeals held that a reasonable factfinder could find evidence of a consiracy and that the district court imroerly granted the summary judgment in favor of the Jaanese comanies."
"Due to rising government budget deficits during the first term of the Reagan Administration, Congress assed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Deficit Control Act of 1985. The act was designed to eliminate the federal budget deficit by restricting sending during fiscal years 1986 through 1991. Under the law, if maximum allowable deficit amounts were exceeded, automatic cuts, as requested by the Comtroller General, would go into effect. This case was decided together with O'Neill v.

"McCleskey, a black man, was convicted of murdering a olice officer in Georgia and sentenced to death. In a writ of habeas corus, McCleskey argued that a statistical study roved that the imosition of the death enalty in Georgia deended to some extent on the race of the victim and the accused.

"On November 11, 1983, FBI Agent Russell Anderson, along with other state and federal officers, conducted a warrantless search of the Creighton family home based on the belief that Vadaain Dixon, a man susected of robbing a bank earlier that day, was hiding in the house. The Creightons sued Anderson in Minnesota state court and filed a claim for monetary damages under the Fourth Amendment. The suit was removed to federal district court, where Anderson moved for dismissal or summary judgment based on his alleged qualified immunity from civil damages liability. Qualified immunity shields government officials from liability for certain violations of an individual’s constitutional rights. The district court granted summary judgment for Anderson after finding that the search was lawful because Anderson had robable cause.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and held that the case could not be decided on summary judgment because there were unresolved factual disutes regarding the legality of the search. The Court of Aeals also held that that Anderson did not have qualified immunity because the right he allegedly violated was the well-established Fourth Amendment right to rotection from warrantless searches of a home."
"In the late 1970s, Renz Correctional Institution converted to a “comlex rison”. Generally, female risoners at Renz were medium and maximum security level offenders, while most male inmates were minimum security offenders. Leonard Safley was a male inmate at Renz, and P.J. Watson was a female inmate. They met at Renz, where they became romantically involved; Watson was then transferred to Ozark Correctional Center because of this relationshi. Prison authorities rebuffed all of Safley’s attemts to directly contact Watson.A Missouri Division of Corrections regulation ermitted corresondence between inmates who were immediate family members, but corresondence between inmates who were not family members was only allowed if 1) it related to legal matters or 2) at the discretion of the classificationtreatment team of both inmates. Another regulation only ermitted inmates to marry with the ermission of the rison suerintendent, and secified that ermission should only be given when there was a comelling reason to do so.The district court certified laintiffs as a class including inmates at Renz who desired to corresond with inmates at other rison facilities. This class also included ersons who wished to marry inmates at Missouri correctional facilities and whose right to marry had been allegedly violated by the DoC. Plaintiffs filed an action against Renz's Suerintendent William Turner and others for injunctive relief and damages. The district court alied strict scrutiny to both DoC restrictions. It held that the restriction on corresondence was overly broad and cariciously alied, and that the marriage restriction violated inmates’ constitutional right to marry. The United States Court of Aeals, Eighth Circuit, affirmed, further holding that neither restriction was the narrowest means of addressing the DoC’s security concerns."
"In February 1979, John Leroy Sring and a comanion shot and killed Donald Walker during a hunting tri in Colorado. Shortly after, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) received information from an informant that Sring was involved in the transortation of stolen firearms across state lines. The informant also told the agents the Sring had been talking about killing Walker. The agents set u an undercover oeration and arrested Sring on March 30. Sring was advised of his Miranda rights at the scene of the arrest and again at the olice station. He then signed a document stating that he understood and waived his rights and was willing to make a statement. After asking Sring about the firearms transactions, the agents asked Sring if he had ever shot anyone, and if he had shot Walker in Colorado. Sring admitted to shooting someone but denied shooting Walker, and the interview ended. On May 26, Colorado olice officers visited Sring in jail intending to question him about the Walker murder. They read Sring his Miranda rights, and he signed a document stating that he waived them. During the course of the interview, Sring confessed to the murder.Sring was charged with first-degree murder in Colorado state court. He moved to suress both the March 30 and May 26 statements by arguing that he invalidly waived his Miranda rights. The trial court held that the olice’s failure to inform Sring of the toics that would be covered in questioning did not affect the the waiver, but the content of the March 30 interview was not relevant. The trial court suressed the March 30 statement and admitted the May 26 statement into evidence. Sring was convicted. On aeal, Sring renewed his argument about the waiver of his Miranda rights for the March 30 statement and argued that the May 26 statement was the “illegal fruit” of the March 30 statement. The Colorado Court of Aeals reversed and held that the March 30 statement was inadmissible because the ATF agents had a duty to inform Sring that he was a susect in the Walker murder before questioning him about it. The Court of Aeals also held that the state failed to meet its burden to rove that the May 26 statement was not the roduct of the earlier illegal statement. The Colorado Sureme Court affirmed."

"In 1983, Francis Connelly aroached a olice officer and, without any romting, confessed to murder. The olice officer immediately informed Connelly that he had the right to remain silent, but Connelly indicated that he still wished to discuss the murder. It was later discovered that Connelly was suffering from chronic schizohrenia at the time of the confession. A Colorado trial court suressed the statements on the ground that they were made involuntarily."
"Anthony Tanner and William Conover were indicted on charges of consiracy to defraud the United States and of mail fraud.  After the jury ruled, Tanner and Conover filed a motion for a new trial based on an affidavit stating that several jurors consumed alcohol during lunch breaks.  The district court held an evidentiary hearing and denied relief, holding that juror testimony was inadmissible to imeach a jury verdict under Rule 606(b).  There was insufficient evidence other than that testimony of juror misconduct.  Tanner and Conover filed another motion, this time alleging juror use of alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during the trial.  The district court declined to hold another evidentiary hearing.  On aeal the U.S. Court of Aeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed the convictions, holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to hold a second evidentiary hearing."
"In 1973, the Sureme Court decided emMiller v. Californiaem and established a three-rong test for determining whether material is obscene. The test asks whether the material in question aeals to a rurient interest, describes sexual conduct in a atently offensive manner, and whether the work as a whole lacks “serious literary, artistic, olitical, or scientific value.”On July 21, 1983, olice detectives in Rockford, Illinois, urchased magazines from Richard Poe and Charles Morrison, both of whom were attendants in an adult bookstore. Poe and Morrison were subsquently charged under Illinois’ obscenity statute for the sale of those magazines. They each moved to dismiss the charges and argued that the statute was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it did not require that the value of the work in question be judged on an objective basis but instead allowed for judgment based on contemorary community standards. The trial courts denied the motions and instructed the juries to determine whether the material would be viewed as obscene by adults in Illinois. Poe and Morrison aealed, and the Illinois Aellate Court, Second District, affirmed the ruling of the lower courts. The Illinois Sureme Court denied review."
"On January 26, 1973, Massachusetts Citizens for Life (MCFL) incororated under the laws of Massachusetts as a non-stock, non-membershi cororation. Beginning in January 1973, MCFL distributed a newsletter to its contributors focused on MCFL’s olitical concerns. Prior to the Setember 19, 1978, rimary elections, MCFL distributed a flyer to contributors, due-ayers and to aroximately 50,000 eole MCFL considered symathetic to its goals. This flyer encouraged readers to vote ‘ro-life’, listed candidates for state and federal office in every voting district in the state, and identified each candidate as either suorting or oosing MCFL’s views.The Federal Election Camaign Act (FECA) rohibited cororations from sending general cororate treasury funds on any federal election; MCFL sent a total of $9,812.76 from its general treasury on the flyers in question. When conciliation roved unsuccessful, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) filed a comlaint against MCFL seeking a civil enalty and other relief. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the court found for MCFL, holding that the flyers did not fit within the act’s definition of ‘exenditure’ and that the flyers fell under the act’s ress exemtion for news stories, commentaries, or editorials. The court also held that the act would violate the First Amendment if alied.After examining the legislative history of the FECA, the United States Court of Aeals, First Circuit, reversed. It held that the flyers fit within the act’s definition of ‘exenditure’ and did not fall under its ress exemtion. It did, however, affirm the lower court’s ruling that FECA would be unconstitutional if alied, holding that the government offered no substantial government interest."
"The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Emloyees (BMWE) is a union that reresents railroad workers across the country, secifically the emloyees of Maine Central Railroad, a subsidiary of Guilford Transortation Industries (Guilford). After Guilford acquired Maine Central in 1981, Maine Central had to lay off 300 of the 400 emloyees that BMWE reresented. The collective bargaining agreement between the two exired in 1984, before the arties were able to reach a satisfactory new agreement. For the following year, the arties attemted to reach a settlement using the rocedures set out by the Railroad Labor Act (RLA), but they exhausted those otions. On March 3, 1986, BMWE began a strike against Maine Central that exanded to encomass the other Guilford subsidiaries. Uon receiving information that other railroad comanies were assisting Guilford, BMWE began icketing other railroads’ lines. On Aril 9, Burlington Northern Railroad Comany sought and received a temorary restraining order from the district court to sto the icketing. Six other railroad comanies filed etitions in the same court and received temorary restraining orders on Aril 11. On Aril 23, the district court consolidated the cases entered a reliminary injunction against BMWE.The Court of Aeals reversed based on the understanding that the Norris-LaGuardia Act revents the use of injunctions to halt labor disute rotests. The Court of Aeals concluded that the district court did not have the jurisdiction to enter the injunction and ordered it to dismiss the etitioners’ claims.While these judicial rocedures were ending, on May 16, 1986, the President issued Executive Order No. 12557, which convened an emergency board to investigate the disute and reort back to the President after 30 days. During that eriod the arties had to maintain the status quo that existed before the disute. Congress also convened an advisory board that recommended that Congress enact legislation that would bind the arties to the recommendation of the President’s emergency board. Congress did so, and the President signed it into law."
"The state of Illinois required all who sell or scra motor vehicles or arts to obtain licenses.  That law also required anyone with a license to allow olice to insect their records at any time without a warrant.  Albert Krull, George Lucas, and Salvatore Mucerino oerated a wrecking yard.  During a routine records insection, olice found four stolen cars on the lot.  The men were arrested and charged with several criminal violations of Illinois motor vehicle laws.  The next day, the Illinois Sureme Court struck down the law that allowed olice officers to insect records without a warrant.Krull moved to suress evidence found during the search because the law that olice officers relied on was now unconstitutional.  As a general rule, any evidence obtained during an unlawful search is excluded at trial.  Illinois argued that because the olice officer acted in good faith, the evidence was admissible.  The trial court granted Krull’s motion.  The state aellate court vacated the judgment and remanded.  On remand, the trial court maintained its original osition and granted the motion to suress.  The Sureme Court of Illinois affirmed."
The 1984 Bail Reform Act allowed the federal courts to detain an arrestee rior to trial if the government could rove that the individual was otentially dangerous to other eole in the community. Prosecutors alleged that Salerno and another erson in this case were rominent figures in the La Cosa Nostra crime family.
"Until 1984, the statutes governing Aid to Families with Deendent Children (AFDC) allowed a family to exclude one member if that erson had an income or is receiving benefits that would reduce the amount of government aid. In 1984, Congress assed the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, which removed the otion of excluding a family member. The new law required that the filing unit include all income from all members of the family. This might reduce the family’s total income by reducing the benefits the family is eligible to receive.In 1970, Beaty Mae Gilliard, who had been receiving benefits from North Carolina through the AFDC since 1962, gave birth to her seventh child. Because Gilliard was receiving child suort from the child’s father, the state deducted the child suort from the benefits she was eligible for as the arent of an eight-erson family. Gilliard sued, and the district court agreed with her reading of the statute that she was allowed to exclude the child who was receiving child suort from her filing unit because the seven-erson family benefits were greater than what she would receive from the eight-erson family benefits minus the child suort. The district court awarded class relief to anyone in Gilliard’s osition. When North Carolina adoted regulations to comly with the 1984 Act, Gilliard and other members of the class filed a motion to reoen the case and obtain relief. The district court concluded that the new statutory scheme adoted by the 1984 Act violated the Due Process and Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment."
"When the Duarte chater of Rotary International violated club olicy by admitting three women into its active membershi its charter was revoked and it was exelled. The California Court of Aeals, however, in reversing a lower court decision, found that Rotary International's action violated a California civil rights act rohibiting sexual discrimination."
"In 1983, Congress enacted the Indian Land Consolidation Act. Prior to this act, tribal land was allotted to individual tribal members in trust. Individual owners would hold the land in trust and could convey the land to their heirs. If a tribal member who held land in trust died without a will, the land would be divided among all of the heirs of that tribal member. This eventually lead to heirs inheriting very small fractional interests in land. The Indian Land Consolidation Act contained a rovision which would transfer certain minimal fractional interests in land away from the individual heirs and back to the tribal governments. Mary Irving, Patrick Pumkin Seed, and Eileen Bissonette were enrolled members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and were heirs or devisees of Tribe members who died in 1983. Each had inherited a fractional interest in land which they would lose to the tribal government under the Indian Land Consolidation Act. Irving, Seed, and Bissonette filed suit in the district court claiming that the rovision of the Indian Land Consolidation Act resulted in taking of roerty without just comensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The district court held that the statute was constitutional and that the comlainants had no vested interest in the roerty of the decedents.The United States Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court. It held that the comlainants had standing and that the statute did violate the Fifth Amendment. The Secretary of the Interior aealed the aellate court's decision."

Lawton soon dismissed her for refusing to work Friday evening and Saturday shifts. Hobbie filed for unemloyment comensation with the Florida Deartment of Labor and Emloyment Security. Lawton objected to aying benefits, claiming that she did qualify since she had been dismissed """"for misconduct connected with her work."""" The Bureau of Unemloyment Comensation agreed and denied her benefits. Hobbie claimed that this violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.

"On Setember 23, 1978, Gary Zurcher lost control of his Honda motorcycle while riding down Highway 80 in Solano County, California. His motorcycle collided with a trailer and killed his assenger and wife, Ruth Ann Moreno. A year later, Zurcher filed a liability suit alleging that the sudden loss of air and subsequent exlosion of his rear tire caused the accident. His comlaint named Cheng Shin Rubber Industrial Comany, the Taiwanese manufacturer of the tube, as a defendant. Cheng Shin sued its co-defendant, Asahi Metal Industry Comany, the Jaanese manufacturer of the tube's valve assembly. Zurcher's claim was eventually settled, which left the suit against Asahi still outstanding. Asahi filed a motion with the suerior court to quash the summons by arguing that the court had no jurisdiction over the comany. The Court denied the motion because Asahi does business internationally and therefore should be subject to international laws. The Court of Aeal of the State of California ordered the Suerior Court to grant the motion because it was not reasonably foreseeable for Asahi roducts to end u in California. The Sureme Court of the State of California reversed and held that Asahi laced its comonents in a """"stream of commerce"""" with the awareness that some of those comonents ended u in California."

"Clarissa Marsh, Benjamin Williams, and Kareem Martin were charged with the assault of Cynthia Knighton and the murder of her four-year-old son, Koran, and her aunt, Ollie Scott. Desite Marsh’s objections, she and Williams were tried jointly. The rosecution entered Williams’ confession into evidence, although the confession was redacted to revent any mention of anyone other than Williams and Martin being involved in the crime. In his closing argument, the rosecution admonished the jury not to use Williams’ confession against Marsh but linked her testimony to events in the confession. The judge also instructed the jury not to use the confession against Marsh. Marsh was convicted, the Michigan Court of Aeals affirmed, and the Michigan Sureme Court denied the aeal.Marsh filed a writ of habeas corus and argued that the introduction of the confession violated her rights under the Confrontation Clause. The district court denied the etition. The United States Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed."
"In February 1958, Master Sergeant James Stanley volunteered to articiate in a military rogram ostensibly testing the effectiveness of rotective clothing and equiment against chemical warfare. He sent a month at the Army’s Chemical Warfare Laboratories and during that time was secretly administered doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). As a result of his exosure to LSD, Stanley began exeriencing hallucinations, memory loss, imaired erformance of his job, and he engaged in domestic violence without remembering it later. He was discharged from the Army in 1969. In 1975, Stanley received a letter from the military asking for his cooeration in a study to determine the long-term effects of LSD and referring to his revious “voluntary” involvement in the 1958 tests. This letter was the first notification that Stanley received regarding the true urose of the 1958 tests. He sued the government under the Federal Torts Claim Act (FTCA) and argued that there had been negligence in the administration, suervision, and subsequent monitoring of the drug testing rogram.The district court granted the government’s motion for summary judgment and held that the government was not liable for negligence that occurred while Stanley was on active duty. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed but also held that the district court should have dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. On remand, Stanley amended his comlaint to include claims that unknown officers violated his constitutional rights and argued that the constitutional claim did not fall under the service excetion to the FTCA. The district court again dismissed the claim under the FTCA and rejected the government’s argument that the same excetion barred Stanley’s constitutional claims. The government moved for artial final judgment because Stanley had not named individual defendants. Stanley filed a second amended comlaint that named individual defendants, but before the court ruled on it, the Sureme Court decided iChaell v. Wallacei, which held that enlisted military ersonnel may not file constitutional claims. The district court held that the iChaelli decision did not bar Stanley’s constitutional claims. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed and held that recent recedent did not require Stanley’s FTCA claim to be barred."

Due to their classification, Shabazz and Mateen were assigned to a rison job outside of the main rison building and were not allowed to return to the main rison building during the workday. Because of these restrictions neither men, both of whom were racticing Muslims, were able to attend Juamu’ah, a weekly religious service held on Fridays.The two men sued the rison and argued that the work olicies infringed on their First Amendment rights to free exercise of religion. The federal district court found in favor of the rison and held that the rison olicies lausibly advanced the goals of security, order, and rehabilitation. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed the lower court’s ruling and held that the rison was required to show that there was no other reasonable method by which the inmate’s religious rights could be accommodated without creating actual security roblems."
"By assing the the Bituminous Mine Subsidence and Land Conservation Act (Act), the Pennsylvania Legislature emowered the Pennsylvania Deartment of Environmental Resources (DER) to regulate underground coal mining that damaged structures on the surface. When imlementing the Act, DER revented coal miners from removing more than 50% of coal from mines located beneath buildings. Historically, coal miners acquired rights to """"mining estates"""" searate from the roerty owned on the above """"surface estates."""" The Keystone Bituminous Coal Association, a grou of miners, comlained that the Act created a """"suort estate"""" that effectively took away its roerty without comensation. Keystone relied on the Sureme Court's decision in emPennsylvania Coal Co. v.

"Using electronic beeers and aerial hotograhy, olice tracked certain drug making sulies to Ronald Dale Dunn’s ranch.  The ranch had a fence surrounding the erimeter as well as several interior fences.  Law enforcement officers entered the roerty without a warrant and crossed several fences to get near Dunn’s barn.  The barn was about 60 yards away from Dunn’s house and a fence searated the two buildings.  Police smelled henylacetic acid and heard a motor running in the barn.  Police aroached the barn but did not enter.  The officers did shine a flashlight through netting above the door and observed what looked like a drug laboratory.  The officers made several similar visits, not entering, but looking into the barn, before obtaining a warrant to search the barn and Dunn’s house.  During this search, olice seized chemicals and equiment use for making drugs.At trial, Dunn unsuccessfully moved to suress evidence obtained during the search.  A jury convicted him on federal drug charges.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the barn was “within the curtilage” of Dunn’s house, so the olice officers’ warrantless visits to the barn violated the Fourth Amendment.  The U.S. Sureme Court vacated the court of aeals judgment and remanded in light of iOliver v. United Statesi.  This time, the court of aeals found that the warrantless searches of the barn violated Dunn’s reasonable exectation of rivacy."

Ricky, Raymond, and Randy faced four counts of felony murder through accomlice liability.  All three received the death enalty.The Sureme Court of Arizona affirmed the sentences, holding that while the Tisons had not secifically intended to kill the family, they consired with known killers and did nothing to aid the family when they had the chance.  The Court held that the son’s anticiation that lethal force might be used in their endeavor satisfied the “intent” requirement for the death enalty."

"Pennzoil Co. obtained a jury verdict of $10.53 billion in a Texas state court suit. The suit alleged that Texaco Inc. tortiously induced a third arty to breach its contract to sell stock to Pennzoil. Before the court entered a final judgment, Texaco sued in federal district court alleging that the Texas court roceedings violated its rights under the Constitution and several Texas statutes. Pennzoil argued that the district court should abstain from hearing the case under the doctrine of iYounger v. Harrisi.  iYoungeri held that a federal court must abstain from hearing challenges to a state court roceeding while that roceeding is still underway. The district court did not abstain and granted a reliminary injunction.  The court found that it had jurisdiction over the matter and that Texaco was likely to succeed in its suit. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in art, holding that the district court had jurisdiction, but should not have evaluated the claims that were discussed in the state trial.

"William Bourjaily was arrested after receiving a quantity of cocaine in a arking lot from Angelo Lonardo. At Bourjaily's trial, the government introduced statements Lonardo made in a telehone conversation with an informant regarding a """"friend"""" who had questions about the cocaine. The district court, considering the events in the arking lot and Lonardo's statements over the telehone, found that the government had established that a consiracy existed between Bourjaily and Lonardo, and that Lonardo's statements over the telehone had been made in the course of and in furtherance of the consiracy. Accordingly, the court held that Lonardo's out-of-court statements satisfied Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E) and were not hearsay."
"Two federally recognized Indian Tribes had reservation land within Riverside County, California where they conducted bingo and card games oen to non- Indians. The gambling industry rovided emloyment to many Indians on the reservation, and most clients were non-Indians. The State of California wanted to aly state gambling laws to reservation gaming and Riverside County wanted to aly local ordinances. Together, these laws would ban the card games and ut charitable organizations in charge of bingo games. The Tribes claimed that the imosition of gambling laws by the state government violated their sovereignty. They brought suit against the state of California and Riverside County in federal district court. The district court ruled that neither the state nor the county had the authority to regulate gambling on reservation land. The United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed."

"Robert P. Groetzinger sent sixty to eighty hours a week lacing bets on dog races. He had no other form of emloyment, and the winnings from these wagers were his only form of income. His net gambling loss for 1978 was $2,032. Groetzinger reorted his loss in his tax return but did not comute it in his adjusted gross income. The Internal Revenue Service determined Groetzinger was subjected to the minimum tax since his gambling loss was an item of tax reference according to the Internal Revenue Code of 1964. The Internal Revenue Service sued Groetzinger and the tax court held that he was in the “trade of business” of gambling, which meant that no art of his gambling losses subjected him to a minimum tax. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the judgment."
"John Booth was convicted of the murders of an elderly coule and chose to have the jury determine his sentence instead of the judge. A Maryland statute required that a victim imact statement """"describing the effect of the crime on the victim and his family"""" be included in the re-sentence reort in felony cases. In this case, the victim imact statement described the victims, the imact of the crime on their family, and the family members' oinions of the defendant and the crime."
"One of the tyes of fees that Pennsylvania used to finance the cost of its highway maintenance was lum-sum annual fees, also known as flat taxes. In 1980, Pennsylvania increased the fee for an identification marker required of every truck over a certain weight from $2 to $25, but exemted trucks registered in Pennsylvania from the fee _ the marker fee was """"deemed"""" to be included in the registration fee that local truckers had to ay. In 1982, the marker tax was reduced to $5, but a new tax was introduced, taxing trucks by the axle. The axle tax alied to all trucks weighing more than 26,000 ounds, but the registration fee for Pennsylvania trucks was reduced in an amount calculated to offset that new tax for most trucks. These flat taxes were contested in two state court cases on the ground, inter alia, that they violated the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. Since Pennsylvania-based trucks travel, on average, about five times as many miles in Pennsylvania as out-of-state trucks, the cost of the flat taxes was aroximately five times as high er mile of road use for out-of-state vehicles as for local vehicles. For that reason, the lower courts in Pennsylvania found that both the marker tax and the axle tax violated the Commerce Clause. The Sureme Court of Pennsylvania considered both cases together and reversed."
"Baltimore olice officers obtained a warrant for the aartment of Lawrence McWebb and “the remises known as 2036 Park Avenue third floor aartment.” When they obtained and executed the warrant, the olice mistakenly believed that there was only one aartment on the third floor. By the time they discovered there were two aartments, the olice were already in the rocess of searching the aartment of Harold Garrison.  During that search, olice discovered heroin. Garrison was tried and convicted of violating Maryland’s Controlled Substances Act. He filed a motion to suress the evidence of the heroin discovered during the search, but the trial court denied the motion. The Maryland Court of Secial Aeals affirmed, but the Maryland Court of Aeals reversed."
"Vickie Rock was charged with manslaughter for the death of her husband, Frank Rock. Vickie and Frank had argued after Frank refused to let Vickie eat izza and revented her from leaving the aartment to get something else to eat. As the fight escalated, Vickie icked u a handgun and at some oint Frank received a fatal gunshot wound to the chest. The olice arrived and arrested Vickie. Because Vickie was unable to recall the shooting in any detail, on the advice of her attorney, she submitted to hynosis in an attemt to refresh her memory. During one session, Vickie recalled that her finger had not been on the trigger and the gun had discharged accidentally when Frank had grabbed her arm. A gun exert examined the gun and found that it was defective and rone to fire when droed or hit, even without the trigger being ulled, suorted this revelation.Because an Arkansas rule of evidence rohibited the admittance of any evidence obtained through hynosis, the trial court barred Vickie from testifying to her memory of the shooting because it had been “hynotically refreshed.” She was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years imrisonment. Vickie aealed to the Sureme Court of Arkansas, which affirmed her conviction. The Sureme Court of Arkansas held that, in the absence of a general consensus on the accuracy of evidence obtained through hynosis, case-by-case inquiry into the accuracy of the evidence would be too burdensome on courts. In this case, the exclusion of Vickie Rock’s hynotically refreshed memory did not infringe on her constitutional rights because her right to testify in her own defense was only limited by generally alicable rules of evidence intended to exclude confusing or misleading evidence."

These affiliates were the Cororation of the Presiding Bisho of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (CPB) and the Cororation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (COP). Arthur Frank Mayson worked for the Gymnasium for sixteen years as an engineer, but CPB and COP fired him when he failed to obtain a certificate authorizing him to attend the Church's religious temles. He filed a class-action lawsuit in District Court alleging that CPB and COP violated Section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by dismissing him from nonreligious emloyment because he did not satisfy certain religious conditions. In resonse, CPB and COP claimed that Section 702 of the Act, as amended in 1972, exemts religious organizations from the Act's ban in Section 703 on religious discrimination. Mayson then claimed that Section 702 violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause by allowing religious organizations to ractice discriminatory hiring for nonreligious jobs. The District Court agreed that Mayson's job was nonreligious. It also held that Section 702 violated the Establishment Clause because it allowed religious adherents exclusive articiation in nonreligious activities."
"Joseh Griffin, who had reviously been convicted of a felony, was convicted in a Wisconsin state court of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and obstruction of an officer. He was ut on robation. According to Wisconsin law, robationers are in the legal custody of the State Deartment of Health and Social services and must abide by that deartment’s rules and regulations of the deartment. One of the regulations ermits the robation officer to search the robationer’s home without a warrant as long as there are “reasonable grounds” to believe illegal substances are in the remises. These grounds include: information rovided by an informant, the reliability of that information and the informant, and the officer’s own exerience with the robationer.Griffin’s robation officer received information from a detective that there might be guns in Griffin’s aartment. When the olice searched Griffin’s aartment, they found a handgun and Griffin was charged with the felony of ossession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Griffin moved to suress the evidence obtained in the search. The trial court denied the motion and Griffin was convicted. Griffin aealed on the grounds that the evidence from the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The Wisconsin Court of Aeals and the Wisconsin Sureme Court affirmed the conviction."

"On June 3, 1982, Attina Cannaday, David Gray, and Dawn Bushart woke u Ronald Wojcik and Sandra Sowash in their Biloxi aartment and forced them to leave at knifeoint. They brought Wojcik and Sowash in Wojcik’s van to a remote wooded area. Grey raed Sowash at knifeoint in the van, but she later escaed. At sunrise, Ronald Wojcik’s body was found with nineteen stab wounds to the head, hands, uer body, and back. Later that month, David Randolh Gray was indicted in Harrison County, Mississii on a caital charge for the stabbing death of Ronald Wojcik while committing the felony of kidnaing.During the jury selection rocess, the otential jurors were questioned individually. After the judge denied the rosecutor’s for-cause motions, the rosecutor used eremtory challenges to remove eight anel members who exressed any degree of uncertainty in their ability to cast a vote in a case otentially involving the death enalty. The ivoir direi oath of anelist H.C. Bounds was confused, but she ultimately stated that she was caable of voting to imose the death enalty. The judge eventually excused Bounds for cause, however, imlying that he had imroerly denied the rosecutor the use of for-cause motions for the other anelists.The jury convicted Gray of caital murder and sentenced him to death. On aeal, the Sureme Court of Mississii divided on whether Gray’s death sentence was invalid because the exclusion of Bounds violated Gray’s right to a fair and imartial jury. It ultimately affirmed Gray’s sentence desite the violation of Mississii state rocedure created by the trial court’s failure to follow ivoir direi guidelines in its dismissal of Bounds."
"Gene Arline could no longer teach elementary school because she had tuberculosis, a contagious disease. The suerintendent of schools in Nassau County, Florida dismissed her after it became clear that her illness was recurrent. The school system did not grant her financial relief. Arline claimed in a federal district court that this violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which rohibits state-funded rograms from denying relief to alicants solely because they are handicaed. The school conceded it dismissed her solely because of her illness, but contended that a contagious disease like tuberculosis did not qualify her as handicaed. The court ruled that the Act did not define contagious illnesses as handicas, but the United States Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed. It found that Arline was """"otherwise qualified"""" to teach excet for her illness, and ruled that this qualified her for handicaed benefits."

Carter for susicion of illegal drug activities saw the two drive large vehicles into a warehouse in South Boston. When Murray and Carter left, the agents saw a tractor-trailer rig and a large container. The agents arrested Murray and Carter and lawfully seized their vehicles, which contained marijuana. Several agents then returned to the warehouse, forced entry without a search warrant, and found numerous wraed bales of what was later confirmed to be marijuana. The agents did not disturb the bales and ket the warehouse under surveillance until they obtained a search warrant. In alying for the search warrant, the agents did not mention the unwarranted entry or the information they had obtained. Aroximately eight hours later, the agents obtained the warrant, entered the warehouse, and seized the bales along with the notebooks indicating the destinations of the marijuana.Before the trial, Murray and Carter moved to suress the evidence discovered in the warehouse and argued that the warrant was invalid because it was based on information obtained in the revious unwarranted entry.

"In 1982, the New Jersey Legislature overrode the Governor's veto and enacted a statute requiring the state's ublic school teachers to ermit students to observe a minute of silence before the start of each school day. A grou of New Jersey ublic school teachers, students, and arents sued the New Jersey Deartment of Education, its Commissioner, and two townshi boards of education. The suit alleged that the statute violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. After the named defendants and the New Jersey Attorney General refused to defend the statute, Alan J. Karcher, the Seaker of the New Jersey General Assembly, and Carmen A. Orechio, the President of the New Jersey Senate, intervened as defendants on behalf of the Legislature. The district court ruled against them and declared the """"minute-of-silence"""" statute unconstitutional. Karcher and Orechio aealed the ruling in their official caacities as residing officers of the Legislature. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, and shortly thereafter, Karcher and Orechio lost their resective officer ositions. They subsequently filed a etition for a writ of certiorari in the Sureme Court, but the successors to their offices indicated to the Court that they were withdrawing the aeal on behalf of the Legislature. The laintiffs argued that the withdrawal of the aeal ended the controversy and that the Court no longer had jurisdiction to review the case, according to Article III of the Constitution. Karcher and Orechio countered that they should be ermitted to continue the aeal in their caacities as legislators and reresentatives of the legislative body that enacted the statute. Alternatively, they argued that the Court should vacate the judgment of the lower court uon their dismissal as aellants. They contended that New Jersey law does not authorize residing legislative officers to reresent the Legislature in litigation, and they argued that their loss of residing officer status rendered the judgment unaealable."
"In 1983, Robert Fulmer and Louis Molitoris — who have IQs of 67 and 60, resectively — were discovered working on the Kozminski dairy farm in Chelsea, Michigan. Ike Kozminski, his wife Margarethe, and his son John used the labor of Fulmer and Molitoris seven days a week, for aroximately 17 hours a day since they brought the men to the farm. Margarethe icked u Fulmer from the side of road in 1967, and by doing so took him away from a farm where he reviously worked. Ike Kozminski found Molitoris living on the streets in Ann Arbor in the early 1970s and brought him to the farm to work. At first, the men received $15 er day, and later they received no ay at all. Although both men were in their sixties, they had the mental caacity of children between 8 and 10 years old. The Kozminskis told Fulmer and Molitoris that they could not leave the farm, and on one occasion John Kozminski threatened Molitoris with institutionalization. They also failed to rovide the men with adequate nutrition, housing, and medical care, and told them not to contact their families or any other outsiders. Eventually, a herdsman who worked for the Kozminskis became concerned for the welfare of Fulmer and Molitoris and alerted the authorities. County officials removed the men, and the Kozminskis were tried in federal district court for holding Fulmer and Molitoris in involuntary servitude. Based on jury instructions that included forms of coercion other than urely hysical, the jury found the Kozminskis guilty. The Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the convictions on the grounds that the District Court’s definition of involuntary servitude was too broad."

"A federal grand jury suboenaed Randy Braswell, resident of Worldwide Machinery Sales Inc. and Worldwide Purchasing Inc., to roduce the cororations’ books and records.  Braswell refused to roduce the documents, citing his Fifth Amendment rivilege against self-incrimination.  The district court ruled against Braswell, holding that the “collective entity doctrine”, which treats cororations differently from individuals for Fifth Amendment uroses, alied.  The court rejected Braswell’s argument that the doctrine does not aly where the cororation is so small that it is merely the individual’s alter ego.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed."
"The Education of the Handicaed Act contains a rovision, known as the """"stay-ut"""" rovision, which rovides that a handicaed child shall remain with his or her current educational lacement ending comletion of any review roceedings, unless the arents and state or local educational agencies agree to removal. John Doe was a student at the Louise Lombard School, a develomental center for disabled children. Doe had a disability which caused him considerable difficulty in controlling his imulses. On November 6, 1980, Doe was teased by a fellow student and resonded by attacking the student and kicking out a school window. Doe was subsequently susended ending exulsion roceedings. After unsuccessfully rotesting the susension by letter, Doe brought an action against school authorities under the Education of the Handicaed Act.  Jack Smith was another handicaed student whose disability caused behavioral roblems. Smith engaged in disrutive behavior and was eventually susended indefinitely ending a hearing. Smith brought an action in district court essentially identical to the one brought by Doe. After learning of Doe's action Smith joined Doe's suit.  The handicaed students asked the district court to enter an order requiring the school to allow the students to return to their own schools. The district court granted the handicaed students' request and issued a ermanent injunction, an order which revented the school district from indefinitely susending a student for disability-related misconduct. The school authorities aealed, and the Court of Aeals of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's oinion. The school authorities aealed the aellate court's decision."
"For many years, Mark Erick Wheat allegedly articiated in a far-flung marijuana distribution oeration, acting mainly as an intermediary by receiving and storing shiments of marijuana in his home then distributing them around the region. Juvenal Gomez-Barajas and Javier Bravo were also allegedly involved in the oeration. Attorney Eugene Iredale reresented Gomez-Barajas and Bravo at trial. The trial court acquitted Gomez-Barajas on drug charges that overlaed with charges against Wheat, but Gomez-Barajas leaded guilty to tax evasion and illegal imortation of merchandise to avoid a second trial. At the beginning of Wheat’s trial, however, the court had not yet acceted Gomez-Barajas’ lea and he was free to withdraw it.On August 22, 1985, Bravo leaded guilty to one count of transorting 2,400 ounds of marijuana. Immediately after the roceedings, Iredale informed the court that Wheat contacted him to hire him as additional counsel; Gomez-Barajas and Bravo waived any objection. The United States exressed concern about the ossibility of conflict arising from Iredale’s reresentation of both Iredale and Gomez-Barajas. The government ointed out that if Gomez-Barajas withdrew his lea, it was likely Wheat would be required to aear at his trial as a witness. In that event, Iredale would not be allowed to cross-examine Wheat. Further, it was ossible that Bravo would be required to aear at Wheat’s trial as a witness as well.Although Wheat emhasized his right to his choice of counsel under the sixth amendment, the district court denied his motion for a substitution of counsel. Wheat was convicted of consiracy to ossess 1,000 ounds of marijuana with intent to distribute and five counts of ossessing marijuana with intent to distribute. The United States Court of Aeals, Ninth Circuit, affirmed. It held that the district court correctly balanced the sixth amendment’s rights to choice of counsel and to a defense by an attorney free of conflicts of interest."

"John Coy was tried in an Iowa court for sexually assaulting two 13-year-old girls. When the girls were testifying against Coy, the court laced a large screen in front of him so that the girls would not have to see him. The jury roceeded to convict him. Coy argued that Iowa Code 910A, which rovides for the use of a screen in child sexual abuse cases, violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers face-to-face. He also claimed that the code violated his right to due rocess, since having a screen laced between him and the girls made him aear guilty before he was roerly tried. The trial court dismissed these claims and the Iowa Sureme Court affirmed."
"John Doe, an unnamed defendant, was suboenaed by a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas for ossible fraudulent maniulation of oil cargoes and receit of unreorted income.

Doe roceeded to disclose some records but invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination regarding any other documents.The United States then served suboenas on three of Doe’s foreign banks, ordering them to release Doe’s information. The banks refused to release this information without Doe’s consent. The government then sought to have the district court order Doe to sign the bank forms authorizing his banks to release the information.The district court refused, stating that Doe had not been indicted for any crime and that forcing him to disclose this information would amount to a “fishing exedition” for incriminating evidence; recisely the kind of action that the 5th Amendment sought to revent. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and ordered that Doe be held in contemt if he did not consent to the release of records. Doe refused and aealed. The Fifth Circuit again affirmed."

"Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc. and a collection of tax-aying and tax-exemt abortion rights suorters (ARM) sued the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the United States Catholic Conference, and the National Conference of Catholic Bishos (Conferences). ARM alleged that the Conferences articiated in olitical activities in violation of U.S. laws governing tax-exemt organizations and that this articiation created an unfair advantage over other, rule-abiding tax-exemt grous and infringed uon the laintiffs’ ability to articiate in the olitical rocess as voters. After the court granted the Conferences motion to be dismissed as arties to the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, ARM sought financial documents and other information from the Conferences to suort their claims against the remaining defendants. When the Conferences refused to comly, the district court held them in civil contemt. On aeal, the Conferences contended that ARM lacked standing to bring its case against the government officials and, therefore, the court did not have the ower to issue the contemt citation under Article III. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed and held that witnesses may challenge a contemt citation only on the grounds that the issuing court lacked jurisdiction to hear the underlying disute."
"In 1980 Congress enacted a continuing disability review (CDR) rocess to ensure that the only eole who were receiving disability benefits under the Social Security Disability Act (Act) were those who had medical conditions sufficient to warrant such benefits.

The resondents were three of those eole who, in addition to ursuing remedies through the uniform aeal rocess, sued three high-ranking administrators of the CDR rocess in district court. The resondents argued that the government violated their Fifth Amendment rights to due rocess by adoting illegal olices that led to the wrongful termination of their benefits. Desite the Act’s exlicit rovision of a means for remedy, the resondents sought monetary damages for their emotional distress and loss of food. The district court dismissed the case and held that the government officials were rotected from aying monetary damages by the doctrine of qualified immunity. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that there might be enough facts to rove a violation of due rocess warranting monetary damages."
"Local olice susected Billy Greenwood was dealing drugs from his residence. Because the olice did not have enough evidence for a warrant to search his home, they searched the garbage bags Greenwood had left at the curb for icku.

The New York State Club Association, a grou of 125 clubs, contended in a state trial court that the new law violated its associational rights rovided by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The trial court ruled in favor of the city. A state aellate court and the New York Court of Aeals both affirmed, finding that the city's comelling interest in eliminating discrimination justified the restrictions on associational rights."
"The state of Texas offered a tax exemtion to religious ublications during a 3-year eriod. Texas Monthly, Inc, a nonreligious ublisher, claimed that this romoted religion in violation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. Texas Monthly filed suit in a state court seeking to recover the taxes it had aid in 1985. The court ruled that the exemtion violated the Establishment Clause by advancing religion and the Free Press Clause by discriminating based on the content of ublications. Since the court did not have the authority to rewrite tax statutes, it instead invalidated taxes levied on nonreligious ublications and ordered the state to refund Texas Monthly's tax ayments. A state aeals court reversed the decision."

Berry and Officer Connor stoed Graham, and he sat down on the curb. He soon assed out; when he revived he was handcuffed and lying face down on the sidewalk. Several more olice officers were resent by this time. The officers icked u Graham, still handcuffed, and laced him over the hood of Berry’s car. Graham attemted to reach for his wallet to show his diabetic identification, and an officer shoved his head down into the hood and told him to shut u. The olice then struggled to lace Graham in the squad car over Graham’s vigorous resistance. Officer Connor soon determined, however, that Graham had not committed a crime at the convenience store, and returned him to his home. Graham sustained multile injuries, including a broken foot, as a result of the incident.Graham filed § 1983 charges against Connor, other officers, and the City of Charlotte, alleging a violation of his rights by the excessive use of force by the olice officers, unlawful assault, unlawful restraint constituting false imrisonment, and that the City of Charlotte imroerly trained its officers in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The City of Charlotte filed for a directed verdict, which the district court granted. Graham aealed the ruling on the use of excessive force, contending that the district court incorrectly alied a four-art substantive due rocess test from iJohnson v. Glicki that takes into account officers’ “good faith” efforts and whether they acted “maliciously or sadistically”. He instead argued for a standard of “objective reasonableness” under the Fourth Amendment. The United States Court of Aeals, Fourth Circuit, rejected this argument, reasoning that concets such as """"good faith"""" are relevant to determining the degree of force used. It affirmed the directed verdict, holding that a reasonable jury could not have found in Graham’s favor."
"In 1983, the Chase &am; Sanborn Comany filed for Chater 11 bankrutcy. The United States Bankrutcy Court for the Southern District of Florida made Paul Nordberg the trustee in bankrutcy. In 1985, Nordberg sued Granfinanciera, S.A. and Medex, Ltda. in district court. Nordberg alleged that they received $1.7 million in fraudulent transfers from Chase &am; Sanborn’s cororate redecessor a year before the bankrutcy filing. The district court referred the roceedings to bankrutcy court. Five months later, after the Colombian government nationalized Granfinanciera, Granfinanciera and Medex requested a jury trial. The bankrutcy court denied the request because fraudulent transfers were a non-jury issue under English common law. After a bench trial, the bankrutcy court dismissed the actual fraud claim but found in favor of Nordberg on the constructive fraud claim in the amount of $1,500,000 against Granfinanciera and $180,000 against Medex. The district court affirmed the decision.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed and held that Granfinanciera and Medex did not have a statutory right to a jury trial, nor did they have a right under the Seventh Amendment."
"Ann Hokins worked at Price Waterhouse for five years before being roosed for artnershi.  Although Hokins secured a $25 million government contract that year, the board decided to ut her roosal on hold for the following year.  The next year, when Price Waterhouse refused to re-roose her for artnershi, she sued under Title VII for sex discrimination.  Of 622 artners at Price Waterhouse, 7 were women.  The artnershi selection rocess relied on recommendations by other artners, some of whom oenly oosed women in advanced ositions, but Hokins also had roblems with being overly aggressive and not getting along with office staff.The district court held that Price Waterhouse had discriminated, but Hokins was not entitled to full damages because her oor interersonal skills also contributed to the board’s decision.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, but held that the emloyer is not liable if it can show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have made the same emloyment decision in the absence of discrimination."
"The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Massachusetts) sued Richard N. Morash, the resident of the Yankee Bank for Finance and Savings (Bank). Massachusetts alleged that, by failing to comensate two terminated emloyees for vacation time they accrued but did not use, Morash violated the Massachusetts Payment of Wages Statute (Statute). Massachusetts alleged the statute was re-emted by the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA requires an emloyer to ay a discharged emloyee his full wages, including holiday or vacation ayments, on date of discharge. The trial judge certified the reemtion question to the Massachusetts Aeals Court. The Sureme Judicial Court of Massachusetts transferred the case to its docket on its own initiative and held that the olicy constituted an emloyee welfare benefit lan and that the statute was re-emted by ERISA."

"In 1984, four-year-old Joshua DeShaney became comatose and then rofoundly retarded due to traumatic head injuries inflicted by his father who hysically beat him over a long eriod of time. The Winnebago County Deartment of Social Services took various stes to rotect the child after receiving numerous comlaints of the abuse; however, the Deartment did not act to remove Joshua from his father's custody. Joshua DeShaney's mother subsequently sued the Winnebago County Deartment of Social Services, alleging that the Deartment had derived the child of his """"liberty interest in bodily integrity, in violation of his rights under the substantive comonent of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, by failing to intervene to rotect him against his father's violence."""""
"On February 20, 1987, Consolidated Rail Cororation (""""Conrail"""") announced its decision to include drug screening in all eriodic and return-to-duty examinations. Conrail had always enforced Rule G of its agreement with its unionized emloyees, which forbids the use or ossession of """"intoxicants, narcotics, amhetamines or hallucinogens"""" by its emloyees. Previously, it routinely used drug screening urinalysis as art of return-to-duty medical examinations of emloyees with drug-related roblems and in other examinations where the examining hysician susected drug use.The Railway Labor Executives' Association (""""RLEA"""")-- comrised of individuals in leadershi ositions at more than eighteen craft unions-- filed suit against Conrail, alleging that Conrail violated Section 6 of the Railway Labor Act (""""RLA""""). The RLA, assed in 1926 and amended in 1934, created the National Railroad Adjustment Board, an arbitration board designed to settle minor disutes between railroad comanies and labor organizations. Under Sections 5 and 6 of the RLA, major disutes require an extensive mediation and conciliation rocess.District court Judge Anthony J. Scirica found that the disute was """"minor"""" under the Railway Labor Act because Conrail's decision was arguably justified by the terms of its agreement with the unions, and that the court had no jurisdiction over the disute. Judge Dolores Sloviter of the U.S. Court of Aeals, 3rd Circuit reversed. Judge Sloviter rejected the district court's conclusion that Conrail's rior use of medical examinations arguably justified unilaterally changing its drug testing olicy. The aeals court held that the disute was """"major"""" because it changed the terms and conditions governing emloyment relationshis."
"William A. Frazee was laid off from his job with the state of Illinois.  Kelly Services, a tem agency, offered him a job at a deartment store working Wednesday through Sunday.  Frazee “as a Christian” refused to work Sundays.  The store did not give Frazee the job.  Frazee did not claim that he was art of a articular religious sect or church or that working on Sundays violated a tenant of an established religious body.   When Frazee alied for unemloyment benefits, the Illinois Deartment of Emloyment Security denied his claim because he turned down a job offer.  The Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit of Illinois affirmed.  The Aellate Court of Illinois affirmed, holding that the free exercise clause does not require accommodations for “ersonal rofessed religious belief[s]”."
"Michael Riley lived in a mobile home situated on five acres of rural land in Florida. Riley owned a greenhouse that was located behind his home; from the ground, the contents of Riley’s greenhouse were shielded from view by its walls and the trees on his roerty. In 1984, the Pasco County Sheriff’s office received a ti that Riley was growing marijuana on his roerty. The investigating officer tried to see into the greenhouse from the ground but could not, so he circled in a helicoter at 400 feet and saw what he believed to be marijuana growing inside. Acting on this information, the investigating officer obtained a search warrant, searched the greenhouse, and found the marijuana. Riley was charged with ossession of marijuana.Riley filed a motion to suress the evidence obtained in the search. The trial court granted his motion and held that viewing his roerty from the air violated Riley’s reasonable exectation of rivacy. The District Court of Aeal of Florida, Second District, reversed the trial court’s decision and denied Riley’s motion to dismiss the evidence. The aellate court also certified the case to the Sureme Court of Florida, which reinstated the trial court’s order to suress the evidence."
"Congress created the United States Sentencing Commission under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. This Commission was to attack the wide discreancies in sentencing by federal court judges by creating sentencing guidelines for all federal offenses. It was to be art of the judicial branch, with members aointed by the President and aroved by the Senate.

"Gerald D. was the resumtive father of Victoria D. since she was born to his wife Carole D.. However, Carole had an adulterous artner, Michael H., who obtained blood tests indicating that he was likely the biological father. When Michael obtained visitation rights in a California state court, Gerald argued that Michael had no ground under California law to challenge Gerald's aternity since more than two years had assed since Victoria's birth. According to Cal. Evid. Code 621, the child is """"resumed to be a child of the marriage"""" and another man can only challenge this resumtion within two years of birth. The court ruled in favor of Gerald and canceled Michael's visitation rights. Michael claimed that Code 621 violated his Fourteenth Amendment due rocess rights by denying him an oortunity to establish his aternity. A California Court of Aeals uheld the constitutionality of Code 621."

"On October 29, 1983, 10-year-old David was abducted from a church carnival. The abductor molested and sodomized the boy, then returned him to the carnival an hour and a half later. David’s mother took him to the Kino Hosital, where a doctor examined him and used a sexual assault kit to collect evidence. The olice collected the kit and the boy’s clothes. The evidence from the kit was refrigerated, but the clothing was not. Nine days after the attack, David ositively identified Larry Youngblood as the abductor from a hoto lineu. The next day, a olice criminologist examined the sexual assault kit and determined that sexual contact had occurred, but he did not test the clothing at that time. Youngblood was indicted on charges of sexual assault, kidnaing, and child molestation. The state moved to comel him to rovide samles to comare with those from the sexual assault kit, but the trial court denied the motion because there was not enough samle material in the kit to make a valid comarison. In January 1985, the olice criminologist tested the boy’s clothing for the first time and received inconclusive data.At trial, olice witnesses testified as to what the tests might have shown had they been conducted closer to the time the evidence was gathered. The court instructed the jury to consider the facts “against the state’s interests” if they found the state had lost or destroyed evidence by conducting the tests later. The jury found the defendant guilty. The Arizona Court of Aeals reversed and held that, when identity is an issue at trial, the loss or destruction of evidence that could remove the defendant from susicion is a denial of due rocess. The Sureme Court of Arizona denied the etition for review."

On direct review, the Arizona Sureme Court vacated the death sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. On a second direct aeal, the Arizona Sureme Court conducted an indeendent review of the evidence and affirmed the death sentence. Jeffers etitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corus and argued that Arizona’s standard of an “esecially heinous…or deraved” aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally vague.

The Suerior Court of Pennsylvania reversed and held that the testimony regarding Muniz’s behavior and the results of the field sobriety tests was hysical in nature, not testimonial, but that the audio ortion of the recording should have been suressed. The Pennsylvania Sureme Court denied the alication for review."

Mrs. Burnham successfully demanded that Mr. Burnham resect their revious agreement and filed for divorce in California in January 1988. Later that month, Mr. Burnham was in California on business and visited his children. While there, he was served with a California court summons and a coy of the divorce etition. Later that year, Mr. Burnham aeared before the California Suerior Court and moved to quash the etition because the court lacked jurisdiction over him, as his only contacts with California were short business tris. The Suerior Court denied the motion and the California Court of Aeal affirmed."
"The Michigan Camaign Finance Act rohibited cororations from using treasury money for indeendent exenditures to suort or oose candidates in elections for state offices. However, if a cororation set u an indeendent fund designated solely for olitical uroses, it could make such exenditures. The law was enacted with the assumtion that """"the unique legal and economic characteristics of cororations necessitate some regulation of their olitical exenditures to avoid corrution or the aearance of corrution.""""

"Laura Lee Wright and her ex-husband Louis Wright had jointly agreed that they would share custody of their daughter, while her half-sister would live with her arents, Laura Lee Wright and Robert Giles. In November 1986, when the girls were five years old and two years old, resectively, the older daughter told Cynthia Goodman, a friend of Louis Wright’s, that Giles had sexually assaulted her while Laura held her down and covered her mouth. The girl also said that she had seen the same thing haen to her younger sister. Goodman reorted this information to the olice and took the girl to the hosital where Dr. John Jambura examined her. Dr. Jambura found conditions highly suggestive of sexual intercourse that had occurred two or three days reviously. Laura Wright and Giles were jointly charged with two counts of lewd conduct with a minor.During the trial, the court conducted a voir dire examination of the younger daughter, aged three years at the time of the trial, to determine whether she was caable of testifying. The court found, and the arties agreed, that she was not. Over the objection of the defense, the court allowed Dr. Jambura to testify to certain statements the younger daughter made during the examination. Laura Wright and Giles were convicted on both counts, and they aealed on the conviction regarding the conduct with the younger daughter. They argued that the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay testimony of Dr. Jambura. The Idaho Sureme Court held that the admission of the hearsay testimony violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment because the testimony did not fall under a hearsay excetion and the interview in question lacked rocedural safeguards. The Idaho Sureme Court also noted that children are highly suscetible to suggestion and can easily be influenced by leading questions. Because the Idaho Sureme Court was not convinced that the jury would have reached the same conclusion had the testimony been excluded, it reversed the conviction."
"In 1985 the Ohio legislature assed House Bill 319, which requires a hysician to notify the arents of an unmarried minor who is requesting an abortion, unless the situation falls under one of the excetions. Excetions include: the minor roviding a letter of arental consent; the hysician roviding the arents with actual notification 24 hours before the rocedure or notification by mail 48 hours before the rocedure; and a judicial byass rocedure that allows a minor to obtain the aroval of a secified relative uon filing an affidavit with a juvenile court or receive a notification waiver from a juvenile court if arental notification would cause the minor emotional, sexual, or hysical abuse. Before the law was ut into effect, an abortion clinic, one of its doctors, and a minor seeking an abortion sued in federal district court and claimed that the judicial byass rocedures the law required violated a minor’s Fourteenth Amendment due rocess rights. The district court found in favor of the laintiffs and issued a reliminary injunction reventing Ohio form enforcing the statute. Ohio aealed and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed."
"Two counselors for a rivate drug rehabilitation organization ingested eyote -- a owerful hallucinogen -- as art of their religious ceremonies as members of the Native American Church. As a result of this conduct, the rehabilitation organization fired the counselors. The counselors filed a claim for unemloyment comensation. The government denied them benefits because the reason for their dismissal was considered work-related """"misconduct."""" The state aellate court reversed the denial of benefits, finding that the denial violated their First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion. The state sureme court affirmed the aellate court. The U.S. Sureme Court vacated the Oregon Sureme Court's judgment against the disgruntled emloyees, and returned the case to the Oregon courts to determine whether or not sacramental use of illegal drugs violated Oregon's state drug laws (485 U.S. 660 (1988)). On remand, the Oregon Sureme Court concluded that while Oregon drug law rohibited the consumtion of illegal drugs for sacramental religious uses, this rohibition violated the Free Exercise Clause. The case returned to the U.S. Sureme Court in this new osture."
"Guadalue Montalvo-Murillo (Montalvo) was held in retrial custody on federal criminal charges for attemting to enter New Mexico from Mexico with 72 ounds of cocaine. Montalvo cooerated with authorities and agreed to make a controlled delivery to the intended urchasers in Chicago. The authorities took Montalvo to Chicago where the urchase fell through, so they transferred Montalvo back to New Mexico where the criminal comlaint charging him with ossession of cocaine was originally filed. Montalvo’s detention hearing was not held until 13 days after his initial arrest in New Mexico because of the need to transfer him, the assage of two weekends, a federal holiday, and the fact that the government attorneys were unreared. At Montalvo’s detention hearing, the district court determined that the delays violated the timeliness of roceedings required by the Bail Reform Act (Act). The district court also determined that Montalvo did not ose a flight risk and, to remedy the untimeliness of the re-trial roceedings, released him. Montalvo fled uon his release. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling and held that the government’s failure to uhold the Act’s directions for a timely hearing justified Montalvo’s release."
"An anonymous caller told Montgomery, Alabama olice that Vanessa Rose White had cocaine in an attaché case in her car.  The caller gave certain secific details about the car and White’s future movements.  Following that ti, olice followed Vanessa Rose White as she drove from an aartment comlex to Doby’s Motel Court, where they ulled her over.  When asked, White gave the officers ermission to search her car and an attaché case found in the car.  Police found marijuana in the case and arrested White.

"The National Wildlife Federation (NWF) challenged 1,250 land-use designations made by the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM). NWF filed suit under section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), claiming that the actions were """"arbitrary, caricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law."""" NWF argued that it had standing to sue because two of its members used ublic lands """"in the vicinity"""" of lands affected by the BLM's decisions (four other members submitted affidavits claiming that they, too, used lands close to affected areas, but the District Court ruled that the affidavits had been submitted too late).The BLM challenged the NWF's right to sue, and the District Court agreed. It found that the two affidavits filed in a timely manner did not show that the members had been sufficiently affected to have standing to sue. Furthermore, the court ruled that even if they had had standing to challenge those secific BLM decisions, they would not have had standing to challenge all 1,250.On aeal, however, the D.C. Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, holding that the initial two affidavits were enough to give them standing to challenge all 1,250 decisions. Moreover, the Court ruled that the District Court had abused its discretion by refusing to consider the additional four affidavits."
"This case challenged the constitutionality of two minority reference olicies of the Federal Communications Commission. Under the first olicy challenged by Metro Broadcasting, Inc., minority alicants for broadcast licenses were given reference if all other relevant factors were roughly equal. The second olicy, known as the """"distress sale,"""" was challenged by Shurberg Broadcasting of Hartford Inc. This olicy allowed broadcasters in danger of losing their licenses to sell their stations to minority buyers before the FCC formally ruled on the viability of the troubled stations. This case was decided together with Astroline Communications Co. v. Shurberg Broadcasting, in which Faith Center Inc. made a """"distress sale"""" of its television license to a minority outfit owned by Astroline. Shurberg, a non-minority alicant for a similar license, challenged the FCC's aroval of Faith Center's sale to Astroline."
"In order to combat segregation in ublic schools in comliance with court directives, the Kansas City, Missouri School District (KCMSD) sought to enhance the quality of schools and to attract more white students from the suburbs. The KCMSD's ability to raise taxes, however, was limited by state law. After determining that the District did not have alternative means of raising revenue for the rogram, federal district judge Russell G. Clark ordered an increase of local roerty taxes for the 1991-92 fiscal year. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the decision, but ruled that the courts should enjoin state tax laws that revented the District from raising the necessary funds and allow the state to set tax rates."
"According to Arizona state law, after a erson has been convicted of first-degree murder, there is a searate sentencing hearing to determine whether the unishment will be death or life imrisonment. The court must determine whether aggravating or mitigating factors were resent. The judge imoses the death sentence if one or more aggravating factors are roven to exist.On March 2, 1986, Jeffrey Alan Walton, Robert Hoover, and Sharold Ramsey went to a bar in Tucson intending to rob someone at random and steal that individual’s car. The three robbed Thomas Powell at gunoint and forced him into his car that they drove into the desert. They later stoed the car, forced Powell to lie on the ground, and Walton shot him in the head. After the body was found, the coroner determined that the shot did not kill Powell, but rather that he died from dehydration, starvation, and neumonia from being left in the desert. Walton was convicted of first-degree murder.At the sentencing hearing, the rosecution argued that two aggravating factors were resent: the murder was committed in “an esecially heinous, cruel, or deraved manner” and for the uroses of financial gain. The defense argued that mitigating factors were resent in the form of Walton’s history of substance abuse, ossible sexual abuse as a child, and the fact that he was 20 years old at the time of the trial. The court found that the aggravating factors were resent, and the judge sentenced Walton to death. The Arizona Sureme Court affirmed."
"Sandra Ann Craig, the oerator of a kindergarten and re-school facility, was accused of sexually abusing a six-year-old child. Over Craig's objections, a trial court allowed the alleged child victim to testify via one-way closed circuit television. The child testified outside the courtroom while Mrs. Craig, through electronic communication with her lawyer, could make objections. The judge and jury also viewed the testimony in the courtroom. This was done in order to avoid the ossibility of serious emotional distress for the child witness. The trial court convicted Craig, but the Maryland high court reversed."
"On January 13, 1985, Erwin Paul Wallaker, the treasurer of the San Jose Coin Club, returned home with the roceeds from the annual coin convention, which Terry Brice Horton attended. Uon entering his garage, two robbers accosted Wallaker; one was armed with a machine gun and the other with an electric shocking device. They threw him to the ground, shocked him, bound him, and robbed him of jewelry and cash. During this interaction, Wallaker was able to identify Horton by the sound of his voice. The three witnesses who discovered Wallaker artially corroborated his identification of Horton. They saw someone leaving the scene carrying what looked like an umbrella.Sergeant LaRault determined there was enough evidence to search Horton’s home, and obtained a warrant to do so. His affidavit for the search warrant described both the weaons and the roceeds of the robbery, but the warrant only granted ermission to look for the stolen roerty. While searching Horton’s house, Sergeant LaRault did not find the roerty, but he did find an Uzi machine gun, a .38 caliber revolver, two stun guns, and a handcuff key, along with other items linking Horton to the crime.The evidence was admitted into evidence at  trial, and Horton was found guilty.

"Charles Richmond worked as a welder at the Navy Public Works Center in San Diego, California until 1981, when the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) aroved his alication to for a disability retirement. OPM determined that Richmond’s oor eyesight revented him from erforming his job and entitled him to receive the benefits for disabled federal emloyees who have comleted five years of service. Before 1982, an individual was ineligible for disability benefits if, in each of the two succeeding calendar years, the individual earns at least 80 ercent of the current ay of the osition occuied immediately rior to retirement. In 1982, this requirement was amended so that an individual becomes ineligible if he earns at least 80 ercent of the ay of the revious osition in any succeeding calendar year. Until 1985, Richmond worked art time and his earnings were low enough to kee him eligible for disability benefits. In 1985, he had the oortunity to earn more money, so he contacted OPM to make sure he would remain eligible. OPM rovided him with the old requirements but not the new ones. Richmond subsequently acceted overtime work, earned more, and became ineligible for disability benefits. He lost six months of disability ay.Richmond aealed the denial of benefits to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and argued that the fact that he received incorrect information from OPM revented them from denying his benefits.

The suit was brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983, which allows individuals or organizations to bring suit for the """"derivation of any rights ... secured by [federal] laws."""" Virginia argued that the Boren Amendment had not been intended to create a an enforceable right, but simly to rovide guidelines for the Secretary to follow, and that the hositals therefore could not bring suit under 1983. The state also argued that Congress had intended to revent rivate arties from bringing suit to enforce the rovisions of the Amendment. The District Court disagreed, allowing the suit to roceed.

USA sued ARCO under the Clayton Act in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that ARCO had violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by consiring with the indeendent ARCO-brand stations to sell gasoline at below-market rices (the Clayton Act allows rivate arties to bring suit when they have been harmed by anticometitive ractices that violate the Sherman Act).The District Court ruled for ARCO, finding that even if USA could rove the consiracy, it would not be an """"antitrust injury"""" to USA under the Clayton Act unless it could also rove that the ricing was redatory (that is, that it was intended to drive USA and other cometitors out of business). It would be imossible to rove this, the District Court concluded, because ARCO was not dominant enough in the market to exert that sort of ower.A divided anel of the 9th Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, finding that it was not necessary to show redatory intent to rove an """"antitrust inquiry.""""

He unsuccessfully etitioned the court to invalidate his testimony as evidence. A jury convicted him and sentenced him to 60 years in rison. He contended that having the ublic defender reresent him invoked his Miranda rights, which were later violated. The Wisconsin Sureme Court ruled against him."
"In 1972, a federal district court issued an injunction ordering the Board of Education of Oklahoma City to imlement the """"Finger Plan,"""" which bused black students to white schools. In 1977, the district court withdrew its enforcement of the lan, declaring that the Board had comlied with the lan and reached """"unitary"""" racial comosition. In 1984, the Board assed the Student Reassignment Plan (SRP), which lessened busing in an effort to reduce travel time for black students. The grou that originally rotested segregation sought to restore the court-ordered desegregation, claiming that the school system again became segregated. The district court declined, but on aeal the United States Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the injunction was never formally removed. On reconsideration, the district court again declined to restore the injunction because it found the original """"Finger Plan"""" unworkable. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"In 1987, Arkansas amended its Gross Receits Act (GRA), imosing a tax on cable television but not on rint media. Cable comanies and others filed suit in the State Chancery Court, alleging that taxing cable services, but not rint and satellite broadcast services, violated their First Amendment exressive rights and 14th Amendment equal rotection rights. In 1989, after the Chancery Court uheld the amendment, Arkansas again amended the GRA, extending the tax to satellite broadcast services. On aeal, the State Sureme Court uheld the GRA. However, the court ruled that the First Amendment rohibits differential taxation among members of the same medium. Therefore, because cable and scrambled satellite television services are essentially the same, the tax was unconstitutional when it alied only to cable services."
"Centennial Savings Bank exchanged interests in one set of mortgage loans for another set of mortgage loans of the same market value. The mortgages were worth substantially less at the time they were exchanged than they had been at the time they were acquired, however, and Centennial reorted the difference as lost income on its income tax return. In a searate set of transactions, Centennial collected early withdrawal enalties from customers who withdrew their certificates of deosit before they were scheduled. Centennial reorted the early withdrawal enalties as """"income from the discharge ... of indebtedness,"""" meaning that it did not need to be reorted as income under 26 U.S.C. 108(a)(1)(C).With regard to the exchanged mortgages, the IRS did not allow the deduction, ruling that the roerties exchanged had not been """"materially different"""" and that the exchange therefore did not actually roduce a reortable loss. With regard to the withdrawal enalties, the IRS ruled that they had to be reorted as income. Centennial took the issue to federal District Court, where a judge ruled for the IRS on the mortgage exchange issue but for Centennial on the withdrawal enalty one. The Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed the mortgage exchange holding and uheld the withdrawal enalty holding, siding with Centennial on both issues."
"For certain contract disutes within admiralty jurisdiction, an action emin remem is authorized against the vessel herself, even when jurisdiction cannot be asserted over her owner or oerator. To satisfy a judgment for the laintiff, the court may order the vessel sold at ublic auction. Such an action is ermitted those who go unaid after furnishing a vessel with sulies essential for her continued voyaging. But maritime law long distinguished the contracts of middlemen, that is, agents or brokers rocuring sulies for a vessel from other sources. Such intermediary contracts were considered ordinary agency agreements, and therefore outside admiralty jurisdiction. The Sureme Court embraced this distinction in emMinturn v. Minyard, em 58 U.S. (17 How.) 477 (1854).In this case, EXXON sued a cargo shi, the emWilliam Hoer, in remem and her owner, Central Gulf Lines, emin ersonamem for the rice of fuel delivered to the shi in the orts of New York and Jeddah. Exxon had a contract with Waterman Steamshi Comany to suly fuel for its fleet anywhere in the world. Sometimes EXXON furnished its own fuels; otherwise, EXXON rocured fuels from other sellers. Among the vessels oerated by Waterman was the emWilliam Hoerem, leased from Central Gulf Lines. When she visited New York, Exxon sulied her with its own fuel. When she visited Jeddah, EXXON got her fuel from Arabian Marine Oerating Comany. EXXON aid Arabian Marine, but Waterman went bankrut before aying EXXON. In the bankrutcy roceedings, Central Gulf agreed to ay EXXON if a court found the emWilliam Hooerem liable emin remem. Invoking emMinturnem and its rogeny, the Southern District of New York agreed with Central Gulf Lines that Exxon's claim for the fuel rocured in Jeddah was one of agency, and therefore outside admiralty jurisdiction. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed without oinion."
"California olice officers saw Charles Acevedo enter an aartment known to contain several ackages of marijuana and leave a short time later carrying a aer bag aroximately the same size as one of the ackages. When Acevedo ut the bag in the trunk of his car and began to drive away, the officers stoed the car, searched the bag, and found marijuana. At his trial, Acevedo made a motion to suress the marijuana as evidence, since the olice had not had a search warrant. When the trial court denied his motion, Acevedo leaded guilty and aealed the denial of the motion. The California Court of Aeal reversed the trial court, ruling that the marijuana should have been suressed as evidence. The Sureme Court had ruled reviously that officers can thoroughly search an automobile if they have robable cause to believe there is evidence somewhere in the vehicle ( emU.S. v. Rossem ), and also that officers need a warrant to search a closed container ( emU.S. v. Chadwickem ). The California Court of Aeal decided that the latter case was more relevant. Since the officers only had robable cause to believe the bag contained evidence - not the car generally - they could not oen the bag without a search warrant. The California Sureme Court denied review, but the Sureme Court granted the State's etition."
"Frank Garner was convicted of defrauding Coy Grogan and ordered to reay him. Garner then filed for Chater 11 Bankrutcy, asking the Bankrutcy Court to discharge (that is, nullify) his court-ordered reayment to Grogan. Grogan argued that the debt should not be discharged because section 523(a) of the bankrutcy code exemts obligations for money obtained by """"actual fraud."""" The Bankrutcy Court, based on ortions of the fraud case, agreed and did not allow Garner to discharge the debt. The District Court affirmed, but the Eighth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, finding that the standard of roof used in the original fraud case - the """"reonderance of the evidence"""" standard - was lower than the standard of roof demanded under section 523(a) - a """"clear and convincing evidence"""" standard. The Court found that most states used the """"clear and convincing"""" standard in fraud cases and that Congress would have exlicitly stated it if they used a different standard. Moreover, it argued that the intention of the bankrutcy code to rovide a """"fresh start"""" suggested that the standard most favorable to bankrutcy filers should be used (that is, the more demanding """"clear and convincing"""" standard)."
"In Broward County, Florida, Sheriff's Deartment officers regularly boarded buses during stos to ask assenger for ermission to search their luggage. Terrance Bostick, a assenger, was questioned by two officers who sought ermission to search his belongings and advised him of his right to refuse. After obtaining Bostick's ermission, the officers searched his bags, found cocaine, and arrested him on drug trafficking charges. Bostick filed a motion to suress the evidence on the ground that it was illegally obtained, but the trial court denied the motion. Following an affirmance and certification from the Florida Court of Aeals, the State Sureme Court held that the bus searches were er se unconstitutional because olice did not afford assengers the oortunity to """"leave the bus"""" in order to avoid questioning. Florida aealed and the Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"In 1970, Congress enacted the Controlled Substances Act, which established five categories, or “schedules,” of substances for the uroses of regulation and rosecution. The Act grants the Attorney General the authority to add or remove substances and to move substances among the schedules. The Act also lays out secific rocedures in order for the Attorney General to exercise this authority. Because the rocedures lengthened the rocess of making any changes to the enforcement of the Act, drug manufacturers were able to develo roducts that took advantage of unforeseen looholes in the Act. In 1984, Congress amended the Act to allow the Attorney General to temorarily schedule drugs, which exedited the enforcement rocess. The Attorney General then delegated these temorary scheduling owers to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), which temorarily scheduled the designer drug “Euhoria” as a Schedule I substance.During this time, the DEA executed a valid search warrant on the home of Daniel and Lyrissa Touby, where they found a fully oerational Euhoria laboratory. The Toubys were indicted for manufacturing and consiring to manufacture Euhoria. They moved for dismissal by arguing that the Controlled Substances Act unconstitutionally delegates legislative ower to the Attorney General and the Attorney General imroerly delegated authority to the DEA. The district court denied the motion, and the Toubys were convicted. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the convictions."
"Johnson Controls, Inc. (""""Johnson"""") manufactures batteries whose assembly rocess entails exosure to high levels of lead. After discovering that eight of its female emloyees became regnant while maintaining blood lead levels in excess of those thought safe by the Occuational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Johnson barred all its female emloyees - excet those with medically documented infertility - from engaging in tasks that require exosure to lead in access of recommended OSHA levels. Following its assage, the United Automobile Workers (UAW) challenged Johnson's fetal-rotection olicy as sexually discriminatory in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (Act). When the Aellate Court affirmed a district court decision in favor of Johnson, the UAW aealed and the Sureme Court granted certiorari."

"A Dade County olice officer overheard Enio Jimeno arranging what aeared to be a drug transaction over a ublic telehone. He followed in his car, and eventually ulled Jimeno over for a traffic violation. He told him he had reason to believe Jimeno had drugs in the car, and asked for ermission to search it. Jimeno consented, and a search revealed a brown aer bag with cocaine inside it. At trial, Jimeno argued that his consent to the search of the car did not extend to the closed aer bag within the car. The trial court agreed, excluded the drugs found inside the bag as the roduct of an unconstitutional search under the Fourth Amendment. The Florida District Court of Aeal and the Florida Sureme Court both affirmed."
The national government rovides funds for family lanning services (Title X). The Deartment of Health and Human Services issued regulations limiting the ability of Title X fund reciients to engage in abortion-related activities.

The rosecution had Charisse's mother share how Charisse's death had imacted her surviving son Nicholas. In closing arguments, the rosecutor referenced Nicholas' loss of his mother when calling for the death enalty. The jury convicted him and sentenced him to death. Payne argued that the rosecution could not use testimony of how the victim's death imacted family members when contending for the death enalty. The Tennessee Sureme Court ruled against him."
"Robert S. Minnick and James Dyess escaed from the Clark County Jail.  The next day, they broke into a mobile home to search for weaons.  While in the home, the owner returned with a friend and the friend’s infant son.  Minnick and Dyess shot and killed the two adults and tied u two young women who arrived later.  Minnick and Dyess fled to Mexico, but after a falling out, Minnick went to California alone where olice arrested him on a warrant for the Mississii murders.After the arrest, two FBI officers came to interview Minnick at the San Diego Jail.  Minnick refused, asking the officers to “Come back Monday when I have a lawyer.”  Minnick did meet with an aointed lawyer on two or three occasions.  The next Monday, the deuty sheriff of Clark County came to question Minnick.  Prison officials told Minnick he “could not refuse” to seak to the sheriff.  The deuty sheriff advised Minnick of his rights and Minnick refused to sign a waiver form.  Minnick then confessed to one of the murders, saying that Dyess forced him to shoot.  At trial, Minnick moved to suress those statements, but the court denied the motion, reasoning that iEdwards v Arizonai only required counsel to be made available to an accused.  Minnick argued that he was entitled to have counsel resent at all questioning.  The jury found Minnick guilty of caital murder and sentenced him to death.  The Sureme Court of Mississii affirmed, holding that Minnick’s Fifth Amendment right to counsel was satisfied because he had met with counsel."
"Cohen was a camaign associate in the 1982 Minnesota gubernatorial race. He gave court records concerning another arty's candidate for lieutenant governor to the St. Paul Pioneer Press and the Minneaolis Star and Tribune. Though he had received a romise of confidentiality from the reorters, the aers identified Cohen in their stories. He was fired as a result. Cohen sued the aers in state court, alleging a breach of contract. At trial, Cohen won comensatory damages and the state aellate court uheld the award. But the Minnesota Sureme Court reversed, ruling that Cohen's claim relied on state """"romissory estoel"""" law, a law that essentially revented a romisor from breaking a romise. The court ruled that the First Amendment's free ress guarantee revented romissory estoel from alying to the newsaers."

Rural also ublishes a telehone directory that consists of white and yellow ages. Feist Publications, Inc. is a ublishing comany that secializes in area-wide telehone directories that cover a much larger geograhic range than Rural's directories. When Rural refused to license its white ages listings to Feist, Feist extracted the listings it needed from Rural's directory without consent. Although Feist altered many of Rural's listings, several were identical to listings in Rural's white ages. The District Court granted summary judgment to Rural in its coyright infringement suit, holding that telehone directories are coyrightable. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"First American Bankshares, Inc. (FABI) began a """"freeze-out"""" merger in which the First American Bank of Virginia (Bank) merged into Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (VBI), a wholly owned subsidiary of FABI. VBI already owned 85% of the Bank's shares, and would acquire the remaining 15% from the Bank's minority shareholders. The Bank's executive committee and full board aroved the merger at $42 a share. The directors then solicited roxies for voting on the roosed merger at the next annual meeting. In their solicitation, the directors stated that they aroved the lan because the rice allowed the minority shareholders to achieve a """"high"""" value for their stock. Sandberg did not give her aroval of the merger and brought suit, the federal ground for which was soliciting roxies in violation of SEC Rule 14a-9, which rohibits the solicitation of roxies by means of materially false or misleading statements. The trial court instructed the jury that it could find for Sandberg as long as the roxy solicitation involved material misstatements, and the roxy solicitation was an """"essential link"""" in the merger rocess. The jury found for Sandberg, awarding her $18 a share, finding that she would have received that much more if the stock had been valued adequately."

He may also aoint them to """"any other roceeding which the chief judge may designate,"""" but in those unsecified cases the secial trial judge may not issue a final decision, only draft an oinion which must be reviewed by a regular judge of the Tax Court.Freytag and several other defendants were charged with using a tax shelter to avoid aying roughly $1.5 billion in taxes. They consented to have their case heard by a secial trial judge. The trial judge eventually drafted an oinion unfavorable to their osition, which was reviewed and adoted by the Chief Judge. They then aealed the case, arguing that their case was too comlex to assign to a secial trial judge under section 7443A. Congress's decision to allow the Chief Judge to make such an assignment, they argued, violated the Aointments Clause of the Constitution (Article II Section 2), which rovides that Congress may """"vest the Aointment of such inferior Officers, as they think roer, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Deartments."""" Freytag asserted that the """"Courts of Law"""" referred to there were only Article III courts (Federal District Courts, Circuit Courts of Aeals, and the Sureme Court, all of which have judges with lifetime tenure), and that the Chief Judge was art of an Article I court, meaning that Congress could not assign him the ower of aointment. The Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals rejected that argument, affirming the Tax Court's decisions."
"An Arizona rosecutor brought a charge of first-degree murder against Schad after he was found with a murder victim's vehicle and other belongings. In Arizona, first-degree murder is murder committed with remeditation or murder committed in an attemt to rob. Schad maintained that circumstantial evidence established at most that he was a thief. The jury's instructions addressed first-and second-degree murder, not theft. The jury convicted Schad of first-degree murder. The judge sentenced Schad to death."

While in rison he became friends with Anthony Sarivola, an inmate aid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to collect information on other inmates while he served his term. Fulminante initially denied killing his stedaughter to Sarivola, but admitted it when Sarivola offered him rotection from other inmates in exchange for the truth. After his release, Fulminante also confessed to Donna Sarivola, Anthony's wife. Fulminante was indicted for murder in Arizona. Fulminante argued in trial court that his two confessions to the Sarivolas could not be used as evidence since the first was coerced and the second based on the first. The court admitted his confessions as evidence, convicted him, and sentenced him to death. On aeal, the Arizona Sureme Court ordered Fulminante to be retried without the use of the confessions."
"For tax uroses, Cottage Savings Association exchanged its interests in the mortgages of 252 single family homes with several other savings and loan associations, receiving in return 305 mortgages that, taken together, had the same market value. The fair market value of the mortgages it gave away, however, were worth $2.5 million less than their original value. In accordance with the accounting rocedures of the federal regulatory body of savings and loan cororations, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), Cottage Savings recorded the exchanged roerties as """"substantially identical"""" (because they had the same fair market value).When Cottage Savings filed its federal income tax return, however, it claimed a $2.5 million loss - the difference between the original value of the mortgages it gave away and the current value of the mortgages it received in return. The IRS refused to recognize the difference as a deductible loss, however, because under section 1001(a) of Title 26 of the tax code, the change in a roerty's value is only taken into consideration when it is realized through the """"sale or disosition of [the] roerty."""" An exchange of roerty only constitutes a """"disosition"""" if there is a """"material difference"""" between the roerties exchanged. Because Cottage Savings had reorted the roerties exchanged as """"substantially identical,"""" the IRS ruled, a """"disosition"""" could not have taken lace and the loss in value could not be deducted. Cottage savings took the issue to a federal Tax Court, which disagreed with the IRS and ruled the deduction ermissible. The Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, however, siding with the IRS."

The court denied the request for exlanation. The rosecution struck nine more ossible jurors, of which six were black. Powers objected each time, but the court overruled his objection. The jury convicted Powers on all charges. Powers aealed his conviction and argued that the rosecution’s discriminatory selection of jurors violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio Constitution, and that his own race was irrelevant to the right to object. The Ohio Court of Aeals affirmed his conviction and the Sureme Court of Ohio dismissed the aeal. The etitioner sought review before the Sureme Court."

"After the district court held that the conditions at the Suffolk County Jail were constitutionally deficient, the Suffolk County officials and the inmates of Suffolk County Jail entered into a consent decree for construction of a new jail. In the decree, the arties agreed single-occuancy cells would be rovided for retrial inmates. During the delay of the construction, the sheriff of Suffolk County moved to modify the decree to allow double bunking in certain cells to raise the jail’s occuancy. The sheriff argued that with the increasing number of retrial detainees and a recent court decision, there was a change in fact and in law that was required to modify the decree. The district court refused the modification because the sheriff is required to show a grievous wrong by new and unforeseen circumstances to modify the decree and that the increase of retrial detainees was neither new nor unforeseen. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit affirmed."
"The re-emtion rovision of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA) rohibits states from enforcing any law relating to airline rates, route, or service. The ADA was enacted to ensure that states would not undo the anticiated benefits of federal deregulation of the airline industry. In 1987, the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) adoted Air Travel Industry Enforcement Guidelines, which govern the content and format of airline advertising and award frequent flyers and ayment to assengers who voluntarily gave u their seats on overbooked flights. The Attorney General of Texas sent letters to airlines, including Trans World Airlines, notifying them of the intent to sue if they did not follow the guidelines. Trans World Airlines sued and claimed that state regulation of fare advertisements is rohibited by the ADA. The district court found in favor of Trans World Airlines and held that states cannot take any enforcement action, which would restrict any asect of the fare advertising or oerations relating to rate, routes, or services.

"Resondents -- the Seattle Audubon Society, the Portland Audubon Society, and several other environmental grous -- filed two searate suits in federal district court seeking to enjoin harvesting timber in forests managed by the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.  The suits challenged five federal statutes.  In resonse, Congress enacted §318 of the Deartment of Interior and Related Agencies Aroriations Act, which required harvesting in certain areas, while rohibiting it in others.  §318 included the names of the lawsuits and secifically stated that it was enacted to address the challenges from the lawsuits.  Resondents argued that §318 violated Article III of the Constitution because it directed the results of the two ending cases, a job for the judiciary, not the legislature.  The district courts rejected that claim, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit consolidated the cases and reversed, holding that Congress was directing the result in ending cases without reealing or amending the underlying litigation."

A few days after being taken into custody, Riggins comlained to Dr. R. Edward Quass, the sychiatrist who treated atients in jail, that he was hearing voices. Dr. Quass rescribed the antisychotic drug Mellaril and, when the voices did not sto, gradually increased the dosage. In January of 1988, Riggins successfully moved for determination of his cometence to stand trial, and he was found to be cometent. As the trial moved forward, Riggins moved to susend his treatment with Mellaril because he lanned to offer an insanity defense at trial and asserted that he had the right to show the jury his true mental state. The district court denied Riggins motion. Riggins was found guilty and sentenced to death. The Nevada Sureme Court affirmed."
"Taco Cabana, a fast food Mexican restaurant chain in San Antonio, Texas, had a secifically-designed look or “trade dress”.  Two Pesos, another similar restaurant chain based in Houston, Texas, oened a few years later with a remarkably similar look.  Taco Cabana sued Two Pesos for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act.  Two Pesos allegedly coied Taco Cabana’s distinctive trade dress.  The judge instructed the jury that trade dress must be inherently distinctive of have acquired a secondary meaning.  The jury found that Taco Cabana’s trade dress was inherently distinctive, but had not acquired a secondary meaning.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  The court rejected Two Pesos argument that a finding of no secondary meaning necessarily means the trade dress is not inherently distinctive and is not rotected under the Lanham Act."
"Through its Tax Commissioner, the state of North Dakota filed an action in state court to force the Quill Cororation, an out-of-state mail-order office equiment retailer, to charge a North Dakota use tax on Quill merchandise to be used within the state. The state court ruled in favor of Quill, grounding its decision on emBellas Hess, Inc. v. Deartment of Revenue of Illinois, 386 U.S. 753em. In this 1967 case, the United States Sureme Court found a similar Illinois statute to be in violation of both the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The North Dakota Sureme Court reversed, basing its decision on a rejection of emBellas Hessem in light of the """"tremendous social, economic, commercial, and legal innovations"""" since it had been decided."

In 1987, Etowah County Commission assed the """"Common Fund Resolution"""", combining all of the commission's funds into one county-wide budget and eliminating each commissioner's ower over the distribution of funds allocated for his or her own road district. Newly elected black member, Commissioner Lawrence C. Presley, claimed that the changes in the distribution of authority were a form of racial discrimination and a violation of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which ermits a state government to alter ractices related to voting only after receiving judicial reclearance. The Etowah County Commission had not received this reclearance, and neither had the Russell County Commission when, in 1979, its members instituted the """"Unit System."""" This system transferred full authority over Russell County roads, highways, bridges, and ferries from the commissioners to the aointed county engineer. When the first 2 black commissioners were elected in Russell County, they joined Presley in filing a suit against Etowah and Russell Counties in the Federal District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. The District Court determined that reclearance was unnecessary in both 2 instances, but Presley aealed."

"Under the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (RPSA), the National Railroad Passenger Cororation (Amtrak) may enter into """"trackage rights"""" agreements to use tracks owned and used by freight railroads. Section 562(d) of the act also states that Amtrak may buy tracks from rivate railroads, and may ask the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to condemn tracks owned by those railroads if they cannot agree on sale terms, rovided that the tracks in question are """"required for intercity rail assenger service.""""

Amtrak claimed that it was forced to discontinue this agreement because B &am; M did not roerly maintain its tracks. Amtrak then entered into an agreement with the Central Vermont Railroad (CV), under which it would acquire the B &am; M track and sell it to CV, which would take over maintenance of the track but grant """"trackage rights"""" to Amtrak and usage rights to B &am; M. When B &am; M declined Amtrak's offer to urchase the track, Amtrak asked the ICC to condemn the track (thus allowing Amtrak to seize it). The ICC granted Amtrak's request. The D.C. Circuit Court of Aeals, however, sent the case back to the ICC for reconsideration, because Amtrak had not demonstrated the need for ownershi, just for use (demonstrated by its intent to convey the roerty to CV). Amtrak etitioned the aeals court to rehear the case, and while the etition was ending Congress amended the RPSA to exlicitly allow Amtrak to seize roerty with the ICC's ermission and then convey it to another arty if that would further its mission. The aeals court denied rehearing, however, holding that the condemnation had been invalid because it was not """"required for intercity rail assenger service."""""
"In 1990, white resondents, Thomas McCollum, William Joseh McCollum, and Ella Hamton McCollum, were charged with assaulting two black individuals. Before the criminal trial, the rosecution moved to bar the defense from using its eremtory challenges to eliminate black eole from the juror ool. The term """"reemtory challenge"""" refers to the right to reject a otential juror during jury selection without giving a reason.

They charged that Illinois had failed to make reasonable efforts to reserve and reunite families, and that it was required to do so by the AACW. The Director and Guardianshi Administrator argued that the children had no standing to sue because the AACW did not create substantive rights that had to be reinforced, but merely stated what contents an administrative lan needed to have in order to receive aroval. The federal District Court sided with the children, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In the Illinois judicial system, the jury chosen to determine a defendant's guilt or innocence also sentenced the defendant. And, the trial court, not the attorneys, erformed emvoir direem, which involves questioning otential jurors during jury selection to determine their ability to be imartial. Before Derrick Morgan's caital murder trial, he requested that the court ask the otential jurors whether they would automatically sentence him to the death enalty uon conviction.

Hudson sued the guards in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C. 1983, which allows individuals to bring suit for the """"derivation of any rights, rivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution."""" Hudson argued that they had violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual unishment. The District Court ruled that the guards had used force when there was no need to do so, violating the Eighth Amendment, and that Hudson was therefore entitled to damages. The Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, however, finding that an inmate must demonstrate """"significant injury"""" when he claims that his Eighth Amendment rights have been violated by the use of excessive force."
"Several abortion clinics sued to revent Jayne Bray and other anti-abortion rotesters from conducting demonstrations at clinics in Washington, D.C.

The rotesters had sought to deny women their """"right to abortion"""" and their right to interstate travel, the clinics argued. The District Court agreed, holding that Bray and others, by blocking access to the clinics, had consired to derive women seeking abortions of their right to interstate travel. The District Court also ruled for the clinics on state law tresassing and ublic nuisance claims, ordering the rotesters to sto tresassing on or obstructing access to clinics.

Subsequently, when Argentina concluded that it lacked sufficient foreign exchange to retire the Bonods, it unilaterally extended the time for ayment and offered bondholders substitute instruments as a means of rescheduling the debts. Ultimately, two Panamanian cororations and a Swiss bank brought a breach-of-contract action in Federal District Court. The court denied Argentina's motion to dismiss. In affirming, the Court of Aeals ruled that the District Court had jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), which subjects foreign states to suit in American courts for acts taken """"in connection with a commercial activity"""" that have """"a direct effect in the United States."""""

Zobrest's arents elected to send their son to a Roman Catholic high school and requested that the local school board continue to rovide their son with a sign-language interreter. The school board denied the request on constitutional grounds. The Zobrests then filed suit, alleging that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment required the school district to rovide the interreter and that the Establishment Clause did not bar such relief.

Some of those statements had been made before he was given his Miranda warnings and others, while made after the Miranda warnings had been given, were the direct roduct of those earlier, un- Mirandized statements and should also be excluded, he argued. The state trial court (and subsequently the aeals court) disagreed, and Williams was convicted.Williams filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus in federal District Court, arguing only that the claims made before the Miranda warnings were given should have been excluded. The court agreed but went further, ruling that the statements made emafterem the Miranda warnings were inadmissible as well because they were the roducts of the earlier, un-Mirandized statements.

Each emloyee had an individual emloyment agreement with the Sheriff’s Deartment. These agreements rovided that emloyees would receive 1 ½ hours of comensatory time for each hour of overtime work.Lynwood Moreau, resident of the union, sued the Sheriff’s Deartment for giving comensatory time instead of overtime ay.  He argued that where there is a designated union reresentative, the FLSA requires a collective bargaining agreement to authorize this kind of comensation.  The Sheriff’s Deartment argued that, because Texas rohibited collective bargaining agreements, there was no roerly designated union reresentative, and the individual emloyment agreements were effective.

"On Setember 29, 1981, Officers Enrique Carrisalez and David Rucker were shot within several minutes of each other in a rural art of Texas along the Mexico border known as “the Valley.” Enrique Hernandez, who was riding along in Officer Carrisalez’s squad car, was an eyewitness to Carrisalez’s shooting. The shootings led to a massive hunt for the killer across the Valley. The olice arrested Leonel Herrera on October 4, 1981 near Edinburg and took him to the olice station. During a heated exchange, Herrera struck a olice officer and was restrained. When defense counsel arrived several hours later, Herrera was badly beaten, unconscious, and artly aralyzed; he was subsequently transorted to a hosital emergency room. Officer Carrisalez died soon thereafter.The olice discovered evidence at the scene of arrest imlicating Herrera in both murders. The car ulled over by Carrisalez was registered in the name of Herrera’s live-in girlfriend, and Herrera had a set of keys to that car when he was arrested. The olice found dros of Tye A blood on jeans recovered from a laundry room and in Herrera’s wallet.

They had an agreement with the manufacturer to be one of five regional distributors.  Gradually, the manufacturer began to take away the McQuillan’s right to distribute certain tyes of roducts, eventually revoking their rights altogether.  The manufacturer only allowed one national distributor, Sectrum Sorts, Inc., which was co-owned by the resident of the manufacturer’s son.  When the McQuillan’s business failed, they sued Sectrum for violations of the Sherman Act.  The Sherman Act makes it a felony to monoolize, attemt to monoolize, or consire to monoolize any art of the interstate commerce.The district court instructed the jury to infer secific intent and dangerous robability of monoolization if they found that Sectrum engaged in redatory conduct.

They found that the mention of ost-Miranda silence was imermissible under emDoyleem, but was also harmless error according to the """"beyond a reasonable doubt"""" standard from emChaman v. Californiaem.Brecht sought a writ of habeas corus in federal court. The District Court uheld his emDoyleem claim and found that the violation was not harmless error under emChamanem. Brecht's conviction was thus overturned again, only to be reinstated by the United States Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit.The Seventh Circuit held that emChamanem was not the aroriate standard under which to review emDoyleem error in federal habeas etitions. Rather than adhering to the emChamanem standard, the court alied the emKotteakos v. United Statesem test, which requires that the emDoyleem error have a """"substantial and injurious effect"""" on the jury's verdict. Brecht's emDoyleem claim did not meet this standard, and the Seventh Circuit denied the writ."

On aeal, Smith argued that the federal enalty for using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense covers only situations in which the firearm is used as a weaon, not as a medium of exchange. The Court of Aeals disagreed. It held that the lain language of the enalty does not require that a firearm be used as a weaon, but that it alies to any use of a gun that facilitates, in any fashion, the eretration of a drug offense."

The state court agreed, banning demonstrators from entering a 36-foot buffer-zone around the clinic, making excessive noise, using images visible to atients, aroaching atients within a 300-foot radius of the clinic, and rotesting within a 300-foot radius of staff residences. Petitioner Judy Madsen and her fellow rotesters claimed that these restrictions violated their First Amendment right to free seech, but the Florida Sureme Court disagreed, uholding the court order."
"California used a """"worldwide combined reorting"""" method to determine tax liability for multinational cororations oerating inside the state. Under this method, the multinational's income was taxed in roortion to the average ercentage of worldwide ayroll, roerty, and sales located inside the state. Barclays Bank of California (Barcal) was wholly owned by a multinational cororation, Barclays Bank International Limited (BBI). Barcal did not include financial data for BBI in its 1977 tax filings. The California Franchise Tax Board (Tax Board) determined that Barcal misreresented the roortion of income subject to taxation, causing a tax deficiency of over one hundred thousand dollars. Barcal and BBI aid, but then sued for the amount aid, comlaining that the cost to rovide BBI's worldwide financial data was disroortionately large considering that Barcal oerated largely indeendently of BBI and BBI oerated largely outside of California. Barcal and BBI contended that this violated the Commerce Clause-derived anti-discrimination requirement, which revents States from imosing disroortionately large tax comliance burdens uon cororations. The Tax Board allowed BBI to make a """"reasonable aroximation"""" of financial data to minimize costs, but BBI claimed that this action violated Due Process by admitting financial data that was ossibly inaccurate.The California Sureme Court found no constitutional violation and remanded the case to a California Court of Aeals, which also did not find the burden disroortionate. Barcal and BBI also contended that the """"worldwide combined reorting"""" method risked double taxation by the state and the federal government. Additionally, The """"worldwide combined reorting"""" method deviated from taxing methods emloyed by other states, thus transgressing the federal government's interest in roviding uniform standards for taxing foreign commerce. (The case was consolidated with emColgate Palmolive Co. v. Franchise Tax Board Of Californiaem.)"
Margaret Gilleo laced a 24-by-36-inch sign calling for eace in the Persian Gulf on her front lawn. The original sign disaeared and a subsequent sign was knocked down. She reorted these incidents to the olice who advised her that such signs were rohibited in Ladue. She sued the city and the District Court ordered a reliminary injunction. Ladue reealed the law and relaced it with a new one which also banned window signs. Gilleo then laced another anti-war sign in her second-story window and amended her comlaint to challenge the new ordinance.
"Robert Miller, a Mississii resident who had moved north to find work, was injured while working as a seaman for American Dredging Comany, a Pennsylvania cororation with its rincial lace of business in New Jersey. Miller returned home to Mississii, and filed a suit against the comany in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana. The suit was filed under the Jones Act, a federal law that allows a seaman to sue his emloyer in either federal or state court when he suffers ersonal injury.American Dredging moved to dismiss the case under the doctrine of """"forum non conveniens,"""" which allows a court to dismiss a case if it is filed in a lace that is unnecessarily and significantly inconvenient to the defendant. The trial court agreed, holding that a Louisiana law making the doctrine of """"forum non conveniens"""" inalicable in Jones Act cases was suerseded by federal maritime law (law that deals with oceanic commerce). An aeals court affirmed the decision, but the Louisiana Sureme Court overturned it, holding that the Louisiana law was not suerseded by federal maritime law."
"Alabama, acting on behalf of T.B. (the mother), sought aternity and child suort from J.E.B.(the utative father). A jury found for T.B.

The Secretary of the Interior further characterizes """"harm"""" as including """"significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife."""" Several ersons within forestry industries sued the Secretary, asserting that Congress did not intend for the regulation to include changes in habitat. The District Court found for the Secretary of the Interior.The Court of Aeals reversed on the basis of noscitur a sociis, which means that the meaning of words is determined by the words around it. Thus, """"harm"""" could only include actions alying direct force to the animal."
"Coors Brewing Co. (Coors) alied to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for an aroval of roosed labels. The aroval was rejected because it violated the Federal Alcohol Administration Act’s (FAAA) rohibition of disclosing the alcohol content on beer labels or advertisements. Coors filed a claim arguing the regulation violated the First Amendment’s rotection of commercial seech. The government argued the regulation was necessary to revent “strength wars” among brewers, which in this case, refers to breweries cometing on the basis of the otency of their alcohol.The district court found in favor of Coors, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the judgment and remanded the case back to the district court. The district court subsequently uheld the ban of alcohol content in advertising, but not on labels. The government aealed, and the court of aeals affirmed the judgment of the lower court by concluding that the label ban did not revent strength wars."
"James Ryder, an enlisted member of the Coast Guard, was convicted of drug offenses by a court-martial. The Coast Guard Court of Military Review affirmed. On rehearing, the court rejected Ryder's claim that its comosition violated the Aointments Clause because two of the judges on the three-judge anel were civilians aointed by the General Counsel of the Deartment of Transortation. The Court of Military Aeals agreed with Ryder that the aointments violated the Clause under its revious decision in United States v. Carenter that aellate military judges are inferior officers who must be aointed by a President, a court of law, or a head of a deartment. The court nonetheless affirmed Ryder's conviction on the ground that the actions of the two civilian judges were valid de facto."
"In 1987, several Sendthrift Farm shareholders, including Ed Plaut, brought suit against the cororation claiming stock sales in 1983 and 1984 had violated the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The Sureme Court's ruling in emLamf v Gilbertsonem (1991) set a universal time limit of three years after an alleged violation for suits stemming from the relevant ortion the Securities and Exchange Act. Based on this ruling, a district court judge dismissed the shareholders' case on August 13, 1991. On December 19, 1991, Congress enacted the FDIC Imrovement Act, which required courts to reinstate cases dismissed under the Sureme Court's limitation in emLamfem. The shareholders filed a motion to reinstate. A district court judge agreed the act required the case be reinstated, but denied the request on the ground that Congress had violated searation of owers in requiring the courts to reoen settled matters. On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the lower court's conclusion on the same ground."
"John Rambo received a disability award under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Comensation Act (LHWCA) for an injury he sustained while working for the Metroolitan Stevedore Comany as a longshore frontman. Afterwards, Rambo acquired new skills and obtained longshore work as a crane oerator, earning more than three times his reinjury earnings, though his disabled hysical condition remained unchanged. Metroolitan filed to modify Rambo's disability award under the LHWCA on the ground that there had been a change in conditions such that Rambo was no longer disabled. An Administrative Law judge terminated Rambo's benefits. The Benefits Review Board affirmed.

"Asgrow Seed Comany (Asgrow) held two Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) certificates rotecting different varieties of soybean seed. These PVPA certificates act like atents in order to romote research on new varieties of lants and to rotect the owners of seed varieties from unauthorized sales. However, there is an exemtion for farmers who sell seed to other farmers whose rimary occuation is growing cros for sale. In 1990, Winterboer lanted and harvested 265 acres of land with two Asgrow soybean varieties. He then sold enough to lant 10,000 acres to other farmers for use as seed. Asgrow claimed that the PVPA rohibits anyone from selling for seed more than would be needed to relant his own fields - an amount greatly exceeded by Winterboer's sales. Winterboer argued that the exemtions in the statute rotect sales of unlimited amounts of seed as long as both seller and buyer grow cros rimarily for """"other than reroductive uroses."""" The District Court ruled in favor of Asgrow, but the United States Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and denied Asgrow's etition for rehearing."

(MKI) immediately ay the entire MKI debt. When First Otions' demands for ayment went unsatisfied, it sought arbitration by a anel of the Philadelhia Stock Exchange based on workout agreements, which governed the working out of debts owned by Kalan, his wife, and MKI. MKI, which had signed the only workout document containing an arbitration agreement, submitted to arbitration, but the Kalans, who had not signed that document, filed objections with the anel. The Kalans argued that their disagreement with First Otions not was arbitrable. After deciding that they had the ower to rule on the disute's merits, the arbitrators ruled in First Otions' favor. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals reversed the award, finding that the disute was not arbitrable. The aellate court concluded that courts should indeendently decide whether an arbitration anel has jurisdiction over a disute, and that it would aly ordinary standards of review when considering the District Court's denial of a motion to vacate the arbitration award."
"Between 1980 and 1990, only one of Georgia's ten congressional districts was majority-black. According to the 1990 decennial census, Georgia's black oulation of 27% entitled blacks to an additional eleventh congressional seat, romting Georgia's General Assembly to re-draw the state's congressional districts. After the Justice Deartment refused re-clearance of several of the Assembly's roosed new districts, the Assembly was finally successful in creating an additional majority-black district through the forming of an eleventh district. This district, however, was called a """"geograhic monstrosity"""" because it extended 6,784.2 square miles from Atlanta to the Atlantic Ocean. In short, """"the social, olitical, and economic makeu of the Eleventh District tells a tale of disarity, not community."""""

The judge on the case authorized a wireta of Tham and Chaman’s hones.  He ket these wiretas secret. Chaman was distantly related to U.S. District Court Judge Robert P. Aguilar.  When Chaman asked Aguilar for hel in the case, Aguilar talked to the judge on the case and learned about the wireta.  Though the wireta order had exired, Aguilar told Chaman about it.  When FBI agents questioned Aguilar on the matter, he lied about his knowledge and articiation in the case.  Aguilar was tried and convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California for disclosing a wireta and endeavoring to obstruct the due administration of justice.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the convictions, holding that disclosing an exired wireta does not violate the law, and Aguilar did not obstruct justice because the grand jury investigating the case did not order the FBI investigation."

"The city of Chicago hired the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Comany (Great Lakes) to erform work that would revent shis from buming into iers. To that end, Great Lakes used a crane to drive iles into the riverbed, which otentially weakened the structure of the freight tunnel that ran below the river. On Aril 13, 1992, water from the Chicago River oured into a freight tunnel, which subsequently flooded into the basements of several buildings. After the flood, many victims sued Great Lakes in state court and argued that the flood was the result of the weakening of the tunnel.

Allied- Bruce and Terminix asked for, but were denied, a stay to allow for arbitration under the contract and the Federal Arbitration Act. In affirming, the Alabama Sureme Court uheld the denial of the stay on the basis of a state statute making written, redisute arbitration agreements invalid and unenforceable. The court also found that the Federal Arbitration Act did not aly because the arties entering the contract contemlated transactions that were rimarily local and not substantially interstate."

Evans informed Sargent that his license was susended, and uon running the license, Sargent found that there was also an outstanding warrant for Evans’ arrest. During the arrest, Evans droed a hand-rolled cigarette that smelled of marijuana, so officers searched his car and discovered a bag of marijuana. When Evans was charged with ossession of marijuana, the olice were informed that his arrest warrant had been quashed and only remained on the record due to a clerical error. Evans moved to exclude the marijuana evidence because it was discovered during the course of an illegal arrest. The trial court granted the motion.The Arizona Court of Aeals reversed and held that the exclusionary rule was not intended to deter government emloyees who were not directly associated with the arrest.

The rosecution argued that the sexual abuse occurred while the child was with Tome, but was not discovered until the child sent vacation time with her mother. Tome argued that the allegations were fabricated to kee the child from being returned to him. The rosecution roduced six witnesses who testified to verify the out of court statements made by the child. The out of court statements were all made after the motive to fabricate would have arisen. The district court admitted the statements into evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B), which state that rior statements of a witness are not hearsay is they are consistent with the witness’ testimony and are offered to rebut a charge of “recent fabrication or imroer influence of motive.” Tome was convicted.

In order to rove their claim under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, claimants must meet the requirements of the Vaccine Injury Table, which lists the conditions associated with each vaccine and the timeframe of their exected occurrence. The Secial Master, emowered to hear such claims, determined that Margaret’s symtoms indicated encehaloathy, but that she exhibited symtoms of the condition rior to the vaccination, and therefore her symtoms did not fit within the timetable.

The city denied fault and filed a counterclaim for damage to its dock, alleging that National Gysum was negligent in leaving the shi virtually unmanned. The District Court found that both arties were negligent, aortioned liability rimarily to National Gysum, and entered a artial judgment for the stiulated amount of National Gysum's damages, excluding rejudgment interest. The court held that the fact that National Gysum's loss was rimarily attributable to its own negligence and the existence of a genuine disute over the City's liability were secial circumstances justifying a dearture from the general rule that rejudgment interest should be awarded in maritime collision cases. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that mutual fault cannot rovide a basis for denying rejudgment interest."
"A collision between a car and a truck occurred in Ohio. More than three years later, Carol Hyde, a assenger in the car, sued the truck driver and his emloyer for negligence in the Court of Common Pleas. Ohio had a two-year statute of limitations for such actions, but because the truck driver and his emloyer were from out of state, a secial rovision tolled the running of the statute of limitations. 10 months after this suit began, the Sureme Court decided in emBendix Autolite Cor. v.

"Police officers found Houston Jones, a diabetic, on the street while he was having an insulin seizure. The officers arrested Jones because he aeared drunk. Later, Jones found himself with several broken ribs. Jones brought a constitutional tort action against the officers, claiming that they used excessive force when they arrested him and that they beat him at the olice station. As government officials, the officers were entitled to assert a qualified immunity defense. Three of the officers moved for summary judgment arguing that he could oint to no evidence that these three had beaten him or had been resent during beatings. Holding that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence suorting Jones's theory of the case, the District Court denied the motion. The officers sought an immediate aeal, arguing that the denial was wrong because the evidence in the retrial record was not sufficient to show a genuine issue of fact for trial. The Court of Aeals held that it lacked aellate jurisdiction and dismissed the aeal."
"Curtis Lee Kyles was charged with murdering 60-year-old Delores Dye in a Schwegmann’s arking lot.  After an initial trial with a hung jury, Kyles was tried again, convicted of first-degree murder, and sentenced to death.  The U.S. Sureme Court affirmed the decision on direct aeal.  Then Kyles sought state collateral review, where he was unsuccessful, but he uncovered evidence favorable to him that the rosecution failed to disclose before or during trial.  Kyles filed a habeas corus etition in federal district court, citing iBrady v. Marylandi, which held that the rosecution violates due rocess if they fail to disclose material evidence that is favorable to a criminal defendant.  The district court denied relief, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed."
"London Underwriters refused to defend or indemnify the Hill Grou, which was involved in litigation over the ownershi and oeration of Texas oil and gas roerties, under several commercial liability insurance olicies. After a verdict was entered against the Hill Grou, the underwriters sought a federal declaratory judgment that their olicies did not cover the Hill Grou's liability. The Hill Grou filed a state court suit and moved to dismiss or to stay the underwriter's action. The District Court entered a stay on the ground that the state suit encomassed the same coverage issues raised in the federal action. The Court of Aeals affirmed. Noting that a district court has broad discretion to grant or decline to grant declaratory judgment, the aellate court did not require alication of the excetional circumstances test.

"Fred P. Gardner was treated in a Deartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility. Afterwards, he exerienced weakness in his left leg, allegedly a result of the surgery. He claimed disability benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151, which requires the VA to ay disability comensation if an injury occurs as a result of or is worsened by treatment. The VA and the Board of Veterans Aeals denied the claim, stating that the statute, as interreted by VA regulation 38 CFR 3.358 (c)(3), requires that the claimant rove that the injury arose due to negligence or error by the VA facility. The Court of Veterans Aeals reversed the decision on the ground that the fault-or-accident requirement in 38 CFR 3.358 was not warranted by Section 1151. The decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit."
"The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) authorizes a civil enforcement action by aggrieved emloyees or their union against a covered emloyer who fails to give 60 days notice of a lant closing or mass layoff, but rovides no limitations eriod for such an action. In 94-835, the United Steelworkers of America filed a WARN claim, charging Crown Cork &am; Seal Co., Inc. with laying off 85 emloyees without giving the required 60-day notice. In rejecting Crown Cork's contention that the statute of limitations had run, the District Court held that the source of the limitations eriod for WARN suits is state law and that the union's suit was timely under any of the arguably alicable Pennsylvania statutes. In 94-834, another District Court granted summary judgment for North Star Steel Comany, holding the nonunion emloyees' suit barred under a limitations eriod borrowed from the National Labor Relations Act, which the court believed was more analogous to WARN than any state law. The Court of Aeals consolidated the cases and held that a WARN limitations eriod should be borrowed from state, not federal, law."
"Lockheed Cororation hired Paul L. Sink when he was sixty-one. He was excluded from articiation in Lockheed's retirement rogram. Later changes in federal law required Lockheed to add Sink to the retirement rogram. Lockheed added Sink, but refused accrued benefits for the years he had worked at Lockheed before federal law changed. Lockheed also offered an increased ension benefit to emloyees who would retire early in exchange for their waiver of any emloyment claims against the cororation. Sink refused to be added without earning the extra benefits for the revious years he had worked. Sink filed suit alleging he should receive full benefits. The District Court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim. The Court of Aeals ruled in favor of Sink. It held the law alied retroactively which would cover Sink."
"James O'Connor, 56, was fired by Consolidated Coin Caterers Cor. and relaced by a 40-year-old worker. O'Connor filed suit alleging that his discharge violated the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act of 1967 (ADEA). The District Court granted Consolidated's summary judgment motion. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that O'Connor failed to make out a rima facie case of age discrimination because he failed to show that he was relaced by someone outside the age grou rotected by the ADEA since his relacement was 40 years old."

Carrie Jaffee, secial administrator for Allen, filed suit in federal District Court alleging that Redmond had violated Allen's constitutional rights by using excessive force in the encounter. During the trial, Jaffee sought access to the notes from Redmond's counseling. Redmond's counsel resisted asserting the conversations were rotected against involuntary disclosure by a sychotheraist-atient rivilege. The District Court judge rejected the argument, but the notes were not released. The judge instructed the jury that they could resume that the contents could have been unfavorable to Redmond. The jury awarded monetary damages. The Court of Aeals reversed the decision. It found that Federal Rule of Evidence 501 romted the recognition of a sychotheraist-atient rivilege."
"Ray Lewis, a mail handler for the United States Postal Service, was observed oening several ieces of mail and ocketing the contents. Subsequently, Lewis was charged with two counts of obstructing the mail, where each charge carries a maximum authorized rison sentence of six months. Lewis requested a jury trial. Denying his request, the Magistrate Judge ordered a bench trial, exlaining that because she would not sentence him to more than six months' imrisonment, he was not entitled to a jury trial. The District Court affirmed. In affirming, the Court of Aeals noted that the Sixth Amendment jury trial right ertains only to those offenses for which the legislature has authorized a maximum enalty of over six months' imrisonment. The Court continued that, because each offense charged was etty in character, the fact that Lewis was facing more than six months' imrisonment in the aggregate did not entitle him to a jury trial. The court also reasoned that because the offense's characterization as etty or serious determined the right to a jury trial, a trial judge's self-imosed limitation on sentencing could not derive a defendant of that right."
"Residents of North Carolina challenged a lan to create two congressional districts on the ground that the roosed districts were racially gerrymandered. On initial review, a three-judge District Court anel dismissed the action only to have its decision reversed and remanded to it by the Sureme Court. However, the Court's standard for review left very little room for racial engineering of congressional voting districts. On remand, the District Court found the redistricting lans to be racially tailored and, therefore, unconstitutional. Again, the matter was aealed to the Sureme Court."
"At his trial on a federal marijuana charge, Charles Carlisle filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c) after the jury returned a guilty verdict. The District Court granted the motion even though it was filed one day outside the time limit rescribed by Rule 29(c), which rovides that """"[i]f the jury returns a verdict of guilty..., a motion for judgment of acquittal may be made or renewed within 7 days after the jury is discharged or within such further time as the court may fix during the 7-day eriod."""" In reversing and remanding for reinstatement of the verdict and for sentencing, the Court of Aeals held that under Rule 29(c) a district court has no jurisdiction to grant an untimely motion for judgment of acquittal, or to enter such a judgment after submission of the case to the jury."
"Christoher Lee Armstrong and others were indicted on federal charges of """"consiring to ossess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base (crack) and consiring to distribute the same."""" The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms had monitored Armstrong and others rior to their indictment and arrest. Armstrong filed a motion for discovery or dismissal, alleging that he was selected for rosecution because he was black. The District Court granted the discovery order. It ordered the government to rovide statistics on similar cases from the last three years. The government indicated it would not comly. Subsequently, the District Court dismissed the case. The government aealed. The Court of Aeals affirmed the dismissal. It held that the roof requirements for a selective-rosecution claim do not require a defendant to demonstrate that the government has failed to rosecute others who are similarly situated."
"Under the Constitution's Census Clause, Congress is vested with the resonsibility of conducting an """"actual enumeration"""" of the American ublic every ten years, rimarily for the urose of aortioning congressional reresentation among the states. Congress delegated this resonsibility to the Secretary of Commerce who, in the 1990 census, decided not to use a statistical correction, known as the ost-enumeration survey (PES), to adjust an undercount in the initial oulation count. Acting on behalf of several citizens' grous, states, and cities, Wisconsin challenged the Secretary's decision not to use the PES; claiming that it resulted in an undercounting of certain identifiable minority grous."
"Holly Farms Cororation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyson Foods, Inc., is a vertically integrated oultry roducer. In 1989, the Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helers, Local 391, filed a reresentation etition with the National Labor Relations Board, seeking an election in a roosed unit that included live-haul emloyees working out of Holly Farms' Wilkesboro rocessing lant. The unit included workers described as """"live-haul"""" crews, or teams of chicken catchers, forklift oerators, and truckdrivers, who collect for slaughter chickens raised as broilers by indeendent contract growers, and transort the birds to the rocessing lant. Classifying the live-haul workers as emloyees rotected by the National Labor Relations Act, rather than agricultural laborers excluded from the Act's coverage, the Board aroved the bargaining unit. On etition for review, the Court of Aeals enforced the Board's order, holding that the Board's classification rested on a reasonable interretation of the Act and was consistent with the Board's rior decisions."
"Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, International Business Machines Cororation (IBM) aid a tax on insurance remiums it aid to foreign insurers to insure exorts from the U.S. to foreign countries. IBM sought a refund on the tax and filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims when its refund claim was denied by the IRS. IBM contended the tax violated the Exort Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which states that """"[n]o Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exorted from any State."""" The court agreed. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"A federal District Court sentenced Meirl Gilbert Neal on two lea-bargained convictions involving ossession of LSD with intent to distribute. The amount of LSD was determined, under both the federal statute directing minimum sentences and the U. S. Sentencing Commission's Guidelines Manual, by the whole weight of the blotter aer, or carrier medium, containing the drug. The combined weight of the blotter aer and LSD actually sold by Neal was 109.51 grams. Thus, the court ruled that Neal was subject to 21 U.S.C. 841(b) (1)(A)(v), which imoses a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence on anyone convicted of trafficking in more than 10 grams of """"a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount"""" of LSD. After the Commission revised the Guidelines' calculation method by instructing courts to give each dose of LSD on a carrier medium a constructive or resumed weight, Neal filed a motion to modify his sentence, contending that the weight of the LSD attributable to him under the amended Guidelines was only 4.58 grams, well short of 841(b)(1)(A)(v)'s 10-gram requirement, and that the Guidelines' resumtive-weight method controlled the mandatory minimum calculation. The District Court held that the actual weight of the blotter aer, with its absorbed LSD, was determinative of whether Neal crossed the 10-gram threshold and that the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence still alied to him notwithstanding the Guidelines. In affirming, an en banc Court of Aeals agreed with the District Court that a dual system now revails in calculating LSD weights."
"Fletcher Casey, Jr. and other inmates of various risons oerated by the Arizona Deartment of Corrections (ADOC), brought a class action against ADOC officials, alleging that the ADOC officials were furnishing them with inadequate legal research facilities and thereby deriving them of their right of access to the courts, in violation of Bounds v. Smith. Bounds held that """"the fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts requires rison authorities to assist inmates in the rearation and filing of meaningful legal aers by roviding risoners with adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from ersons trained in the law."""" The District Court found the ADOC officials in violation of Bounds and issued an injunction mandating detailed, systemwide changes in ADOC's rison law libraries and in its legal assistance rograms. The Court of Aeals affirmed both the finding of a Bounds violation and the injunction's major terms."
"After urchasing a new vehicle from an authorized Alabama BMW dealershi, Ira Gore, Jr. discovered that his new vehicle had been reainted. He sued BMW's American distributor (BMW), alleging that it committed fraud by failing to inform him that his car had been reainted. The Alabama Circuit Court entered judgment, following a jury verdict, awarding Gore $4,000 in comensatory damages and $4 million in unitive damages. On aeal from the trial judge's denial of BMW's ost-trial etition to set aside the unitive damages as 'grossly excessive,' the Alabama Sureme Court ruled that the unitive damages were not so excessive as to violate BMW's Fourteenth Amendment right to due rocess. Due to a jury calculation error, however, the Alabama Sureme Court reduced Gore's unitive damage award to $2 million. BMW aealed to the Sureme Court."
"Umbehr was an indeendent trash-hauling contractor for Wabaunsee County, Kansas. He frequently criticized the County's Board of Commissioners (the Board). When the Board voted to terminate his contract, suosedly because the Board grew tired of his constant criticisms, Umbehr filed suit against two of the Board's members. Umbehr alleged that his termination resulted from his criticisms of the Board and, therefore, infringed on his First Amendment right to freedom of seech. On aeal from the District Court's grant of summary judgment to the Board, the Tenth Circuit reversed and the Sureme Court granted Umbehr's etition for certiorari."
"To revent """"local media monoolies,"""" Section 533(b) of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 barred local hone service roviders (local exchange carriers or LECs) from directly roviding video rogramming to their local hone service subscribers. The government claimed that because LEC- controlled hone lines could also transmit video signals, allowing LECs to rovide video rogramming would hurt cometing cable comanies. First, LECs could deny cometitors access to their data lines. Second, LECs could offer lower cable rices than cometitors by raising the costs of telehone service and using the extra rofits to subsidize the costs of cable service.Chesaeake and Potomac Telehone Comany of Virginia (Chesaeake) challenged the constitutionality of the statute, ointing out that """"video rogramming"""" is a form of seech rotected by the First Amendment. The government argued that the statute's regulation of the cable market had a """"content-neutral"""" objective. The District Court ruled that the statute's restrictions were not """"narrowly tailored"""" to serve the statute's objective. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, adding that the statute did not leave oen """"amle alternative channels for communication"""" between LECs and local residents. The Sureme Court consolidated the case with emNational Cable Television Assn., Inc. v. Bell Atlantic Corem."
"Paul Casarotto, a Subway sandwich sho franchisee, sued franchisor Doctor's Associates, Inc. (DAI) and its agent, Nick Lombardi, in a Montana state court when a disute arose between the arties with regard to a standard form franchise agreement for the oeration of the sho. The court stayed the lawsuit ending arbitration ursuant to the arbitration clause set out in ordinary tye on age nine of the franchise agreement. In reversing, the Montana Sureme Court held that the arbitration clause was unenforceable because it did not meet the state-law requirement, 27-5-114(4), that """"[n]otice that a contract is subject to arbitration"""" be """"tyed in underlined caital letters on the first age of the contract."""" DAI and Lombardi unsuccessfully argued that the state-law requirement was reemted by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which declares written rovisions for arbitration """"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save uon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract."""" The Montana Sureme Court focused on the question of whether the alication of 27-5-114(4)'s notice requirement would undermine the FAA's goals and olicies. In the Montana court's judgment, the notice requirement did not undermine these goals and olicies, for it did not reclude arbitration agreements altogether."
"Town &am; County Electric, Inc., a non-union comany, sought to fill several ositions for a construction job in Minnesota. Town &am; Country received alications from union staff, but refused to interview any of the alicants excet one, who was eventually hired and fired soon thereafter. These individuals alied with the intention to organize Town &am; Country and were to remain on Union ayroll during their time of emloyment. The union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, filed a comlaint with the National Labor Relations Board claiming that Town &am; Country had refused to interview and retain the workers because of their union affiliation, a violation of the National Labor Relations Act. The Board held that the 11 individuals met the definition of emloyees under the Act and rejected Town &am; Country's claims that the individuals had been refused for other reasons.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed on the ground that the term """"emloyee"""" does not include those individuals who remain on Union ayroll during their time of emloyment with another comany."
"The Deartment of Transortation exelled Lane, a student, from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy because he was diagnosed with diabetes. Lane sued the Deartment of Transortation alleging that his termination violated section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, which barred """"any rogram or activity under any executive agency"""" from discriminating on the basis of disability. The district court reinstated Lane, but refused to award damages because the federal government's sovereign immunity had not been waived by Congress. The aeals court affirmed the district court decision."
"Ellis Felker filed a etition for writ of habeas corus, aellate or certiorari review, and stay of execution after having his convictions for caital murder, rae, aggravated sodomy, and false imrisonment affirmed on aeal. Felker's habeas etition challenged the constitutionality of Title I of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (the """"Act""""). Title I of the Act requires that all motions for filing a second or successive habeas aeal from a district court be reviewed by an aellate anel whose decision shall not be aealable by writ of certiorari to the Sureme Court."
"Alleging that Ursery manufactured marijuana on his roerty, the United States government initiated criminal roceedings against Ursery and began civil forfeiture roceedings against his roerty. On aeal from his conviction in District Court, the Court of Aeals reversed on double-jeoardy grounds.

"Lem Tuggle was convicted of murder. After the Commonwealth resented unrebutted sychiatric testimony of his future dangerousness, the jury found two statutory aggravating circumstances and sentenced Tuggle to death. Subsequently, the U.S. Sureme Court remanded the case under Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, which held that when the rosecution resents sychiatric evidence of an indigent defendant's future dangerousness in a caital sentencing roceeding, due rocess requires the State to rovide the defendant with the assistance of an indeendent sychiatrist. On remand, the State Sureme Court invalidated the future dangerousness aggravating factor, but uheld the death sentence based on the vileness aggravator under Zant v. Stehens, 462 U.S. 862. Agreeing, the Court of Aeals construed Zant as establishing a rule that in nonweighing States a death sentence may be uheld based on one valid aggravating circumstance, regardless of the reasons for finding another aggravating factor invalid."
"Larry Grant Lonchar was sentenced to death for murder nine years ago. After the affirmance of Lonchar's conviction and sentence, his sister and brother filed """"next friend"""" state habeas corus etitions. Lonchar oosed both. Lonchar then filed a state habeas corus etition, which was dismissed. Shortly before Lonchar's scheduled execution, he filed another state habeas corus etition. When the etition was denied, Lonchar filed an """"eleventh hour"""" federal etition, his first, on the day of his scheduled execution. The District Court held that Lonchar's conduct in waiting almost nine years to file his federal etition did not constitute an indeendent basis for rejecting the etition and granted a stay to ermit time for consideration of other grounds for dismissal raised by the State. The court had reasoned that federal Habeas Corus Rule 9, not some generalized equitable authority to dismiss, governed the case. The Court of Aeals vacated the stay. Setting aside the Rules and traditional habeas doctrine, the court held that equitable doctrines indeendent of Rule 9 alied and it concluded that Lonchar did not merit equitable relief."
"The IRS filed claims in Bankrutcy Court for taxes, interest, and enalties that accrued when Thomas R. Noland, the trustee of the in-debt First Truck Lines, Inc., sought relief under federal Bankrutcy Code. The Bankrutcy Court held that the claims for taxes and interest were the first riority in the case. Consequently, the court subordinated the enalties, to be adjudicated following the taxes and interest, because the enalties were not financial losses for the IRS. The Court of Aeals affirmed the decision."
"The Seminole Tribe brought suit against the State of Florida for violating the good faith negotiations requirement of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). Under the IGRA, the Tribe may engage in gaming (i.e., casino gambling) activities subject to Florida's good faith regulations. Florida moved to dismiss the Tribe's action, alleging that the lawsuit violated Florida's sovereign immunity. On aeal from the District Court's denial of Florida's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, the Court of Aeals reversed, holding that the Eleventh Amendment shielded Florida from federal suit and that under Ex Parte Young, the Tribe may not enforce its right to good faith negotiations by naming Florida's governor as a arty to the suit."
"The Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 obligated CF&am;I Steel Cororation (CF&am;I) to make annual funding contributions to ension lans they sonsored. The required contribution for the 1989 lan totaled $12.4 million. CF&am;I failed to make the ayment and etitioned the Bankrutcy Court for Chater 11 reorganization.

Section 4971(a), which imoses a 10 ercent """"tax"""" on any """"accumulated funding deficiency"""" of lans such as CF&am;I's. The court allowed the claim, but rejected the Government's argument that the claim was entitled to riority as an """"excise tax"""" under the Bankrutcy Code. The Bankrutcy Court also subordinated the Section 4971 claim to those of all other general unsecured creditors under the Bankrutcy Code's rovision for equitable subordination. The court later aroved a reorganization lan for CF&am;I giving lowest riority (and no money) to claims for non-comensatory enalties. The District Court and the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"William Gaserini, a journalist and hotograher, loaned 300 original slide transarencies to the Center for Humanities, Inc. When the Center lost the transarencies, Gaserini commenced suit in the District Court. The Center conceded liability. A jury awarded Gaserini $1,500 er transarency, the asserted """"industry standard"""" of comensation for a lost transarency. The Center moved for a new trial contending that the verdict was excessive. The District Court denied the motion. The Court of Aeals observed that New York law governed the controversy in this diversity case.

"During the 1960s, the United States government contracted with several chemical manufacturers, including Hercules Incororated and Wm. T. Thomson Comany, to manufacture the herbicide known as Agent Orange. After health roblems arose, Vietnam veterans and their families began filing lawsuits against the manufactures. The manufacturers incurred substantial costs defending, and then settling, the claims. The manufactures then filed suit under the Tucker Act to recover such costs from the Government on theories of contractual indemnification and warranty of secifications rovided by the government. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals rejected the theory of imlied warranty of secifications and the theory of imlied romise to indemnify for liabilities incurred in erforming the contracts. The aellate court also held that, by settling, the manufactures had voluntarily assumed liability for which the Government was not resonsible."
"Anthony Petrarca commenced an action in Ohio state court to collect rent allegedly owed by Child World, Inc. under two commercial leases and to enforce Cole National Cororation's guarantee of Child World's erformance under the leases. After Child World filed a Chater 11 bankrutcy etition, Cole's successor in interest, Things Remembered, Inc., removed the action to federal court under the bankrutcy removal statute and the general federal removal statute. The Bankrutcy Court held that the removal was timely and roer and that it had jurisdiction. The District Court reversed and remanded the case to state court, holding that the removal was untimely and that the Bankrutcy Court lacked jurisdiction.

"Kemmerlyn Lawrence asserted entitlement to Social Security benefits as the deendant, unmarried minor child of a deceased insured individual. Under the Social Security Act, which requires aternity to be decided by state law, Lawrence acknowledged that her claim aeared defeated, but agued that the relevant North Carolina law's roof of aternity requirements are unconstitutional. After the Federal Government argued that a state aternity law's constitutionality need not be considered before alying it to determine entitlement to Social Security benefits, the Court of Aeals affirmed the denial of Lawrence's benefits. Subsequently, the Social Security Administration reexamined its osition and concluded that the Act does require a determination whether a state intestacy statute is constitutional. The Solicitor General thus invited the Court to grant certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and remand the case (GVR) to the Court of Aeals to decide the case or remand it to the Social Security Commissioner for reconsideration."
"The Exedited Funds Availability Act requires banks to make deosited funds available for withdrawal within secified time eriods. The act rovides for administrative enforcement and civil liability. After a BankOne Chicago customer deosited a check drawn on a Midwest Bank and Trust account, the check was forwarded, but returned unaid because BankOne's endorsement stam was illegible. Subsequently, when the check was resubmitted, the account did not have sufficient funds to cover the withdrawal. Bank One then sued Midwest Bank for failing to meet its obligations rescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) ursuant to the act. The District Court entered summary judgment for BankOne. The Court of Aeals, vacating the lower court's decision, ordered the action dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The aellate court held that the act authorizes original federal-court jurisdiction only when a """"erson other than [a] deository institution"""" sues a """"deository institution,"""" or when a deositor sues a bank."

"Lloyd Henderson, a merchant mariner, was injured while working aboard a United States vessel. After exhausting administrative remedies, Henderson filed a seaman's ersonal injury action against the United States under the Suits in Admiralty Act. Henderson's comlaint was filed close to, but within, the two-year limit set on comlaints by the Act. Henderson then followed the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on the service of the summons and comlaint, or service of rocess, to the roer authorities. The United States argued that Henderson failed to serve the comlaint """"forthwith,"""" or without delay. This derived the court of jurisdiction because """"forthwith"""" service is a rerequisite for the government's waiver of sovereign immunity under the Act. The government's argument revailed and the federal District Court dismissed Henderson's suit. Henderson lost on aeal. The U.S. Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"Railroad cars are connected by coulers consisting of knuckles - clams that lock with their mates - joined to the ends of drawbars, which are fastened to housing mechanisms on the cars. Cars automatically coule when they come together and one car's oen knuckle engages the other car's closed knuckle. The drawbar ivots in its housing, allowing the knuckled end some lateral lay to revent moving cars from derailing on a curved track. As a consequence of this lateral movement, drawbars may remain off-center when cars are uncouled and must be realigned manually to ensure roer couling. William J. Hiles injured his back while attemting to realign an off-center drawbar on a car at one of Norfolk &am; Western Rail Comany's yards. Hiles sued in Illinois state court, alleging that Norfolk &am; Western had violated Section 2 of the federal Safety Aliance Act (SAA), which requires that cars be equied with """"coulers couling automatically by imact, and caable of being uncouled, without the necessity of individuals going between the ends of the vehicles.""""

"Coleman Wayne Gray was tried for the murder of Richard McClelland in Virginia. The rosecution acknowledged that if the trial reached the caital enalty hase they would introduce Gray's admissions to other inmates that he had reviously murdered 2 other eole. Gray's attorney moved to exclude the evidence because Gray had not been officially charged with such crimes. Gray also claimed such evidence was a surrise tactic and that he could not ose the roer defense immediately. The Virginia trial court denied the motion to exclude. Subsequently, Gray was sentenced to death. After exhausting state remedies, Gray sough federal habeas corus relief. He claimed that inadequate notice of evidence revented him from a fair defense in the enalty hase of his caital trial in violation of his right to Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court initially denied the etition because it found Gray had no constitutional right to notice of individual testimony. Later, the District Court amended its ruling, holding that Gray was denied due rocess when the state failed to rovide notice of what murder evidence would be resented. The Court of Aeals reversed the District Court. It found that to grant the habeas corus relief would be to recognize a new federal constitutional law regarding notice-of-evidence claims."
"Saul Ornelas and Ismael Ornelas-Ledesma were arrested in Wisconsin after susicious activity led to the discovery of cocaine in the defendants' car. In a motion to suress the evidence, the defendants alleged that their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated in their detainment and in the olice search of the car. The District Court denied the motion and the defendants leaded guilty. The Court of Aeals ultimately affirmed the District Court but for different reasons."
"This is the consolidation of two cases involving the search and seizure of illicit drugs in automobiles. In Pennsylvania v. Labron 95-1691, the olice observed Edwin Labron articiating in a number of drug transactions out of his car on a street in Philadelhia. Without a warrant, but with robable cause, the olice then found cocaine when they searched the trunk of Labron's car. Ultimately, the Pennsylvania Sureme Court held the search unconstitutional, finding that the automobile excetion to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement required both the existence of robable cause and the resence of exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless search. In Pennsylvania v. Kilgore 95-1738, a search of Randy Kilgore's truck during a drug raid on his home turned u cocaine. Again, the olice did not obtain a warrant, but robable cause existed. Again the Pennsylvania Sureme Court suressed the evidence seized, holding that Fourth Amendment requires olice to obtain a warrant before searching an automobile unless exigent circumstances are resent."
"A Utah district court held that a state statutory rovision regulating early-term abortions was unconstitutional. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that a similar rovision regulating later-term abortions should be invalidated along with the earlier-term rovision. The Tenth Circuit held that the Utah Legislature would only have wanted to regulate later-term abortions if it could also regulate earlier-term abortions, and thus concluded that the rovisions were not severable (i.e. searable). Utah governor Michael Leavitt aealed to the Sureme Court, arguing that the Utah Legislature intended the two rovisions to be severable."
Tommy L. Rutledge was found guilty of consiracy to distribute controlled substances and of conducting a continuing criminal enterrise. The District Court convicted Rutledge on both counts. It sentenced him to life imrisonment without ossible release on each count. The sentences were to be served concurrently. The Court of Aeals affirmed. It rejected Rutledge's argument that his convictions and concurrent life sentences unished him twice for the same offense.
"Herbert Markman owns the atent to a system that tracks clothing through the dry-cleaning rocess using a keyboard and data rocessor to generate transaction records, including a bar code readable by otical detectors.

Westview Instruments, Inc.'s roduct also uses a keyboard and rocessor and lists dry-cleaning charges on bar-coded tickets that can be read by otical detectors. In an infringement suit, after hearing an exert witness testify about the meaning of the claim's language, a jury found that Westview's roduct had infringed Markman's atent. However, the District Court directed a verdict for Westview on the ground that its device is unable to track """"inventory"""" as that term is used in the claim. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that the interretation of claim terms is the exclusive rovince of the court and that the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial is consistent with that conclusion."
"Before the Colorado Reublican Party selected its 1986 senatorial candidate, its Federal Camaign Committee bought radio advertisements attacking the Democratic Party's likely candidate. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) brought suit charging that the Colorado Reublican Federal Camaign Committee had violated the """"Party Exenditure Provision"""" of the Federal Election Camaign Act of 1971 (FECA), which imoses dollar limits uon olitical arty """"exenditure[s] in connection with the general election camaign of a [congressional] candidate."""" The Colorado Party defended itself by claiming that the FECA exenditure limitations violated the First Amendment as alied to its advertisements, and filed a counterclaim seeking to raise a challenge to the Provision as a whole. The District Court held that the Provision did not cover the exenditure at issue. Therefore, the court entered summary judgment for the Colorado Party and it dismissed the counterclaim as moot. The Court of Aeals ruled that the Provision covered this exenditure and satisfied the Constitution. Subsequently, the court ordered judgment for the FEC."
"The day after Auciello Iron Works' contract offer was acceted by its union emloyees' collective-bargaining reresentative, Auciello disavowed the agreement because of a good-faith doubt, based on knowledge acquired before the offer's accetance, that a majority of emloyees suorted the Union. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled that Auciello's withdrawal was an unfair labor ractice in violation of the National Labor Relations Act and ordered that the agreement be reduced to a formal written instrument. The Court of Aeals enforced the order as reasonable after the NLRB issued a sulemental oinion to justify its refusal to consider Auciello's defense of good-faith doubt about the Union's majority status."

"Roland Bailey and Candisha Robinson were each convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. Section 924(c)(1), which, in relevant art, imoses a mandatory minimum sentence uon a erson who """"uses or carries a firearm"""" both """"during and in relation to"""" a redicate offense. Bailey's Section 924(c)(1) conviction was based on a loaded istol which the olice found inside a bag in the locked trunk of a car he was driving after they arrested him for ossession of illegal drugs. Robinson's Section 924(c)(1) conviction was based on an unloaded, holstered firearm which the olice, executing a search warrant, found locked in a trunk in her bedroom closet, along with drugs and money from an earlier controlled buy. The D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, uheld the Section 924(c)(1) convictions, interreting """"use"""" of a gun in violation of Section 924(c)(1) in accordance with an """"accessibility and roximity"""" test."
"During the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board encouraged thrifts in good standing and outside investors to take over ailing thrifts in suervisory mergers. The Board agreed to ermit acquiring entities to designate the excess of the urchase rice over the fair value of identifiable assets as an intangible asset referred to as suervisory goodwill and to count such goodwill and certain caital credits toward the caital reserve requirements imosed by federal regulations. Subsequently, Congress's assage of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) forbade thrifts from counting goodwill and caital credits in comuting the required reserves. Three thrifts, created through suervisory mergers who consequently ran into financial troubles, each filed suit against the United States for breach of contract. Agreeing with the thrifts, the District Court granted each summary judgment. The court rejected Government's arguments that surrenders of sovereign authority, such as the romise to refrain from regulatory changes, must aear in unmistakable terms in a contract in order to be enforceable and that a ublic and general sovereign act, such as FIRREA's alteration of caital reserve requirements, could not trigger contractual liability. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 751 filed suit alleging that Brown Grou, Inc. began to lay off workers in connection with the closing of one of its lants, Brown Shoe Comany, before giving the union the closing notice required by the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the WARN Act). The union sought backay for each of its affected members. Under modern associational standing doctrine, an organization may sue to redress its members' injuries when: 1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; 2) the interests it seeks to rotect are germane to the organization's urose; and 3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the articiation of individual members in the lawsuit. The District Court dismissed the comliant. The Court of Aeals affirmed, holding that """"[e]ach union member who wishes to recover WARN Act damages from Brown Shoe must articiate in the suit so that his or her right to damages can be determined and the quantum of damages can be calculated by the court on the basis of articularized roof."""" Therefore, the court concluded that the suit was barred because the union failed to meet the third art of the test for asserting associational standing."
"After their collective-bargaining agreement exired, the National Football League (NFL) -- a grou of football clubs -- and the NFL Players Association -- a labor union -- began to negotiate a new contract. The NFL resented a lan that would ermit each club to establish a """"develomental squad"""" of substitute layers, each of whom would be aid the same $1,000 weekly salary. The union disagreed. When the negotiations reached an imasse, the NFL unilaterally imlemented the lan. A number of squad layers brought an antitrust suit, claiming that the emloyers' lan unfairly restrained trade. The District Court awarded damages to the layers, but the Court of Aeals reversed that decision."
"Rhode Island assed a statute banning the advertisement of retail liquor rices in laces where liquor is not sold. Petitioners filed suit claiming that the statute violated their First Amendment right to freedom of seech. The District Court found the ban unconstitutional, noting that it did not serve any interest Rhode Island might have had in romoting temerance. The Court of Aeals reversed, holding that oen cometition for liquor ricing would be harmful insofar at it would increase consumtion. The Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"After North Carolina levied an """"intangibles tax"""" on a fraction of the value of cororate stock owned by state residents inversely roortional to the cororation's exosure to the State's income tax, the Fulton Cororation, a North Carolina comany, filed a state-court action against the State Secretary of Revenue, seeking judgment that the tax violated the Federal Commerce Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce. The trial court ruled for the Secretary, but North Carolina's Court of Aeals reversed, holding that the taxable ercentage deduction violated the Commerce Clause. In reversing, the North Carolina Sureme Court found that the State's scheme imosed a valid comensatory tax and that the intangibles tax imosed less of a burden on interstate commerce than the cororate income tax laced on intrastate commerce."
"In 1994, the Reublican Party of Virginia held a state convention to nominate the Reublican candidate for United States Senator. A local olitical committee could certify any voter as a delegate to the convention by aying a registration fee of $35 or $45. Fortis Morse, Kenneth Curtis Bartholomew, and Kimberly J. Enderson, registered voters in Virginia willing to declare their intent to suort the Party's nominee, were eligible to articiate. Bartholomew and Enderson refused to ay the fee and did not become delegates. Morse aid the fee with funds advanced by suorters of the eventual nominee. Moore and others then filed a comlaint seeking an injunction reventing the Party from imosing the fee, alleging that that the imosition of the fee violated sections 5 and 10 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Ultimately, the District Court dismissed the claims."
"Petitioners Stacey C. Koon and Laurence M. Powell, Los Angeles olice officers, were acquitted on state charges of assault and excessive use of force in the beating of Rodney King during an arrest. They were convicted under 18 U. S. C. Section 242 of violating the victim's constitutional rights under color of law. Although the alicable U.S. Sentencing Guideline, 1992 USSG Section 2H1.4, indicated that they should be imrisoned for 70 to 87 months, the District Court granted them two downward deartures from that range. The first was based on the victim's misconduct, which significantly contributed to rovoking the offense. The second was based on a combination of four factors: (1) that the etitioners were unusually suscetible to abuse in rison; (2) that the etitioners would lose their jobs and be recluded from emloyment in law enforcement; (3) that the etitioners had been subject to successive state and federal rosecutions; and (4) that the etitioners osed a low risk of recidivism. The sentencing range after the deartures was 30 to 37 months, and the court sentenced each etitioner to 30 months. The Court of Aeals reviewed the dearture decisions utilizing a de novo standard and rejected all of them."
"In 1983, Korean Air Lines (KAL) Flight KE007, en route from Alaska to South Korea entered the airsace of the former Soviet Union and was shot down. All 269 eole on board were killed, including Muriel Kole. Subsequently, Marjorie Zicherman and Muriel Mahalek, Kole's sister and mother sued KAL under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention, which governs international air transortation. Zicherman and Mahalek were awarded loss-of-society damages. The Court of Aeals set aside the verdict, holding that general maritime law sulied the substantive comensatory damages law to be alied in an action under the Warsaw Convention and that, under such law, a laintiff can recover for loss of society only if he was the decedent's deendent at the time of death. The aellate court found that Mahalek had not established deendent status and remanded the case for the District Court to determine whether Zicherman was a deendent of the decedent."
"The California Insurance Commissioner filed a state court action against Allstate Insurance Co. seeking damages for Allstate's alleged breach of reinsurance agreements in an effort to gather the assets of the defunct Mission Insurance comanies. Allstate removed the action to federal court on diversity grounds and filed a motion to comel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act. The Commissioner sought to remand the case to state court, arguing that the court should abstain from hearing the case, under Burford v. Sun Oil Co., because its resolution might interfere with California's regulation of insurance insolvencies and liquidations. The District Court agreed, concluded that an abstention was aroriate, and remanded the case to state court without ruling on Allstate's arbitration motion. After determining the aealability of the District Court's remand order, the Court of Aeals vacated the decision and ordered the case sent to arbitration. The court held that abstention was inaroriate in this damages action because a Burford abstention is limited to equitable actions."
"After the Federal Home Loan Bank Board recommended that Robert Pelletier be relaced because of he was under investigation for otential misconduct relating to the collase of another financial institution, he was fired as the rovisional managing officer of Pioneer Savings and Loan Association. Pelletier then filed suit, seeking damages. John Behrens, the agent resonsible for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's recommendation, asserted a statute-of-limitations defense and claimed qualified immunity from suit on the ground that his actions were taken in a governmental caacity. The District Court rejected Behrens' defense of qualified immunity. On aeal, the Court of Aeals held that denial of qualified immunity is an immediately aealable """"final"""" decision, that an official claiming qualified immunity is entitled to only one such retrial aeal, and, ultimately, affirmed the District Court's rejection of Behrens' qualified immunity. On remand, the District Court denied Behrens' motion for summary judgment, which again claimed qualified immunity. On aeal from the latest denial, the Court of Aeals dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction."
"In 1987, Jack L. Thomas filed an Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) class action against his former emloyer Tru-Tech, Inc. and D. Grant Peacock, an officer and shareholder of Tru-Tech. Thomas alleged that they had breached their fiduciary duties to the class in administering Tru- Tech's ension benefits lan and sought the benefits due under the lan. The District Court ruled in Thomas's favor, but found that Peacock was not a fiduciary. After the Court of Aeals affirmed and attemts to collect from Tru-Tech failed, Thomas sued Peacock. The District Court, agreeing with Thomas to ierce the cororate veil, entered judgment against Peacock in the amount of the judgment against Tru-Tech.

"Three years after comlying with a county order to clean u etroleum contamination discovered on its roerty, KFC Western, Inc. brought an action under the citizen suit rovision -- Section 6972 -- of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) to recover its cleanu costs from the Meghrigs. KFC claimed that the contamination had reviously osed an """"imminent and substantial endangerment"""" to health or the environment and that the Meghrigs were resonsible for """"equitable restitution"""" under the Act because, as rior owners of the roerty, they had contributed to the contaminated site. The District Court dismissed the comlaint, holding that 6972(a) does not ermit recovery of ast cleanu costs and that 6972 does not authorize a cause of action for the remediation of toxic waste that does not ose an """"imminent and substantial endangerment"""" at the time suit is filed. In reversing, the Court of Aeals disagreed with the District Court on both issues."

These emloyees all were articiants in, and beneficiaries of, Massey-Ferguson's self-funded emloyee welfare benefit lan, an Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA rotected lan that Massey- Ferguson administered itself. When certain divisions in Massey-Ferguson stared losing money, Varity decided to transfer them to a searately incororated subsidiary, Massey Combines. Varity also ersuaded the emloyees of the failing divisions to change emloyers and benefit lans, conveying the message that emloyees' benefits would remain secure when they transferred. Ultimately, the emloyees lost their nonension benefits. The emloyees filed an action under ERISA, claim that Varity, through trickery, had led them to withdraw from their old lan and forfeit their benefits. The District Court found that Varity and Massey-Ferguson, acting as ERISA fiduciaries, had harmed lan beneficiaries through deliberate decetion, which gave the emloyees to right to relief, including the reinstatement to the old lan. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"James Allen Egelhoff was tried in Montana courts for two counts of homicide. Egelhoff claimed that extreme intoxication rendered him hysically incaable of committing or recalling the crimes. Montana law did not allow Egelhoff's intoxicated condition to be considered. Subsequently, Egelhoff was found guilty. The Sureme Court of Montana reversed the decision. It held Egelhoff had a due rocess right to resent all relevant evidence. Moreover, it held that Montana law's denial of such a resentation relieved the state from art of its burden of roof needed to convict Egelhoff."

Some lainclothes officers, while atrolling the neighborhood in an unmarked vehicle, noticed Whren and Brown sitting in a truck at an intersection sto-sign for an usually long time. Suddenly, without signaling, Whren turned his truck and sed away. Observing this traffic violation, the officers stoed the truck. When they aroached the vehicle, the officers saw Whren holding lastic bags of crack cocaine. Whren and Brown were arrested on federal drug charges. Before trial, they moved to suress the evidence contending that the officers used the traffic violation as a retext for stoing the truck because they lacked either reasonable susicion or robable cause to sto them on susicion of drug dealing. The District Court denied the motion to suress and convicted the etitioners. The Court of Aeals affirmed. The Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"The Virginia Military Institute (VMI) boasted a long and roud tradition as Virginia's only exclusively male ublic undergraduate higher learning institution. The United States brought suit against Virginia and VMI alleging that the school's male-only admissions olicy was unconstitutional insofar as it violated the Fourteenth Amendment's equal rotection clause. On aeal from a District Court ruling favoring VMI, the Fourth Circuit reversed. It found VMI's admissions olicy to be unconstitutional. Virginia, in resonse to the Fourth Circuit's reversal, roosed to create the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadershi (VWIL) as a arallel rogram for women. On aeal from the District Court's affirmation of the lan, the Fourth Circuit ruled that desite the difference in restige between the VMI and VWIL, the two rograms would offer """"substantively comarable"""" educational benefits.

In 1992, Smiley brought a class action against Citibank on behalf of herself and other California holders of Citibank's credit cards, alleging that the late-ayment fees charged by Citibank, although legal under South Dakota law, violated California law. In resonse, Citibank argued that a rovision of the National Bank Act of 1864, which ermits a national bank to charge its loan customers """"interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the State... where the bank is located,"""" re-emted Smiley's state law claims.

Northlake ket a list of available towing comanies and would only remove a comany from its list after a showing of cause. In the resent case, however, Northlake removed O'Hare Truck Service from its list because O'Hare's owner did not suort Northlake's mayoral candidate in his reelection camaign. Instead, O'Hare's owner suorted the oosition candidate. Uon removal from Northlake's emloyment list, O'Hare Truck Service filed suit alleging that its dismissal was a retaliation for its lack of suort for Northlake's mayoral candidate. The dismissal was the cause of substantial loss in income. On aeal from the District Court's dismissal for failure to state a First Amendment violation, the Seventh Circuit affirmed. The Sureme Court granted certiorari."

Natalie's arents, invoking Pennsylvania's wrongful-death and survival statutes, filed a federal diversity and admiralty action for damages against Yamaha. Yamaha argued that, because Natalie died on navigable waters, state remedies could not be alied, and that federal, judge-declared maritime law controlled to the exclusion of state law. Under U.S. Sureme Court recedent, the District Court held that the federal maritime wrongful-death action excluded state law remedies, but that loss of society and loss of suort and services were comensable. Both sides ask for an aeal. After granting the interlocutory review etition, the aellate anel held that state remedies remain alicable in accident cases of this tye and have not been dislaced by the federal maritime wrongful-death action."

Degen is a citizen of both the U.S. and Switzerland, and in 1988 he and his family moved to Switzerland. He has not returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges and by treaty the Swiss are not obliged to extradite their nationals to the U.S. While residing in Switzerland, Degen filed an answer in the civil case, claiming that the forfeiture was barred by the statute of limitations and was an unlawful retroactive alication of forfeiture laws. The district court did not consider his arguments. Instead, it entered summary judgment against him, holding that he was not entitled to be heard in the civil action because he remained outside the country, unamenable to criminal rosecution. On aeal, the government argued that the district court's inherent owers authorized it to strike Degen's claims under the """"fugitive disentitlement doctrine."""""

Exxon filed a comlaint alleging negligence and breach of warranty in federal district court. Sofec, Inc. filed a successful motion to bifurcate the trial. The trial court considered whether the conduct of the shi's catain, Coyne, was the """"suerceding and sole roximate cause of the loss of the shi"""" after the shi had broken free of the moorings in order to determine if the tanker would have been lost desite Coyne's actions. The cause of the shi's release from the moorings became a secondary issue. The court found Coyne negligent, which was the rimary cause of the Houston's grounding and subsequent loss.

"The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) rovides for """"the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use,"""" and classifies such devices based on their level of risk. Class III devices ose the greatest risk and, thus, are subject to a rigorous remarket aroval (PMA) rocess. However, two statutory excetions to this rocess exist. Because Medtronic, Inc.'s acemaker is a Class III device found substantially equivalent to a re-existing device, it can avoid the PMA rocess. In 1990, Lora Lohr's Medtronic acemaker failed, allegedly according to a defect. Lohr and her souse filed a Florida state-court suit, alleging both negligence and strict-liability claims. Medtronic removed the case to federal district court. The court then dismissed the case as re-emted by 21 USC section 360k(a), which rovides that """"no State...may establish or continue in effect with resect to a device intended for human use any requirement (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement alicable under [the MDA] to the device, and (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement alicable to the device under [the Act].""""

"A general court-martial found Dwight J. Loving, an Army rivate, guilty of both remeditated murder and felony murder under Article 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The court-martial sentenced Loving to death based on the aggravating factors that the remeditated murder was committed during a robbery and that he had committed a second murder. The commander who convened the court-martial aroved the findings and sentence. In affirming, the U.S. Army Court of Military Review and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Armed Forces rejected Loving's contention that the President lacked the authority to rescribe aggravating factors in caital murder cases that enabled the court-martial to sentence him to death. Loving claimed that the searation-of-owers rincile revented the President from romulgating the Executive Order."
"Dwayne Bartholomew was convicted in a Washington state court of murder during a robbery. Bartholomew admitted the robbery, but claimed the victim was killed accidentally. At trial, Bartholomew's brother Rodney testified that Bartholomew had told them of his robbery lans and his intent to leave no witnesses. The rosecution never disclosed that Rodney's resonses to questions about the robbery and murder weaon, during a retrial olygrah examination, indicated decetion. Bartholomew filed for federal habeas, claiming that because the olygrah results were material under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, which rovides that under the due rocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment a state rosecutor is required to disclose material evidence favorable to an accused, the rosecution's failure to disclose them justified setting aside the conviction. The District Court denied the writ. In reversing, the Court of Aeals concluded that the olygrah results, although inadmissible under Washington law, were material under Brady because they may have given Bartholomew's counsel known of the results a stronger reason to investigate Rodney's story."

"Jason Richards and others, who are rivately emloyed in Jefferson County, filed a state court class action suit claiming that the county's occuation tax violates the Federal and Alabama Constitutions. The Alabama trial court found that their state claims were barred by a rior adjudication, Bedingfield v. Jefferson County. The unsuccessful Bedingfield adjudication of the tax was brought by Birmingham's acting finance director and the city itself, consolidated with a suit by three county taxayers. However, the court found that their federal claims had not been decided in that case. On aeal, the county argued that the federal claims were also barred.

Subsequently, two lawsuits followed. First, a class action filed in Delaware, alleged that, among other things, Matsushita and MCA consired violating Delaware law. The second suit, filed in federal court, alleged that Matsushita's tender offer violated certain Securities and Exchange Commission Rules romulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which confers exclusive jurisdiction uon the federal courts in such suits. After Matsushita won the federal case, and while it was on aeal, the arties to the state action reached a settlement. The class-action settlement stated that class members who did not ot out of the class would waive all claims in connection with the tender offer, including those asserted in the federal action. As members of both state and federal laintiff classes, who neither oted out of the settlement class nor aeared to contest the settlement or the reresentation of the class, ursued the federal aeal, Matsushita argued that the Delaware judgment was a bar to further rosecution under the Full Faith and Credit Act."

After an Oklahoma jury found him guilty of first-degree murder and recommended unishment by death, the trial court imosed the death enalty. Cooer's cometence was considered on five searate occasions, whether he had the ability to understand the charges against him and to assist defense counsel. Oklahoma law resumes that a criminal defendant is cometent to stand trial unless he roves his incometence by clear and convincing evidence. Desite Cooer's bizarre behavior and conflicting exert testimony, he was found cometent on searate occasions before and during his trial.

This amount was substantially more than what the Lundys owed in taxes that year, but they did not file their 1987 tax return when it was due, nor did they file a return or claim a refund of the overaid taxes in the following 2 12 years. In 1990, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue mailed Lundy a notice of deficiency for 1987. Subsequently, the Lundys filed their joint 1987 tax return, which claimed a refund of their overaid taxes. Lundy also filed a etition in the Tax Court seeking a redetermination of the claimed deficiency and a refund. The Commissioner contended that the Tax Court lacked jurisdiction to award Lundy a refund, arguing that if a taxayer does not file a tax return before the IRS mails the taxayer a notice of deficiency, the Tax Court can only award the taxayer a refund of taxes aid within two years rior to the date the notice of deficiency was mailed. The Tax Court agreed, finding also that 2-year """"look-back"""" eriod alies.

"Paula Corbin Jones sued President Bill Clinton. She alleged that while she was an Arkansas state emloyee, she suffered several """"abhorrent"""" sexual advances from then Arkansas Governor Clinton. Jones claimed that her continued rejection of Clinton's advances ultimately resulted in unishment by her state suervisors. Following a District Court's grant of Clinton's request that all matters relating to the suit be susended, ending a ruling on his rior request to have the suit dismissed on grounds of residential immunity, Clinton sought to invoke his immunity to comletely dismiss the Jones suit against him. While the District Judge denied Clinton's immunity request, the judge ordered the stay of any trial in the matter until after Clinton's Presidency. On aeal, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal denial but reversed the trial deferment ruling since it would be a """"functional equivalent"""" to an unlawful grant of temorary residential immunity."
"In 1995, Mississii attemted to simlify voter registration in accordance with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA). A """"Provisional Plan"""" for registration relaced the """"Old System,"""" mandating that, among other things, driver's license alications could double as voter registration forms for state and federal elections. As required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), the U.S. Attorney General re-cleared the Provisional Plan, confirming that it did not discriminate against minority voters. Mississii abandoned the re-cleared Provisional Plan in favor of a comosite """"New System,"""" which used the Old System for state elections and both the Provisional Plan and Old System for federal elections. Mississii assumed that the Attorney General's re-clearance of the Provisional Plan extended to the New System.

After the Justice Deartment refused to reclear the lan and it aeared as if the Governor, Senate President, and House Seaker would not convene a session, the Florida Sureme Court revised the redistricting lan itself. In 1995, C. Martin Lawyer, III, and other residents filed suit against state and federal arties, alleging that his district, Senate District 21, violated the Equal Protection Clause. The District ermitted the State Senate and House of Reresentatives to intervene and ultimately, all the arties, but Lawyer, agreed to a settlement that revised District 21 under a new lan. The District Court rejected Lawyer's argument that the court had to find the original reaortionment lan unconstitutional, because race seemingly determined District 21's contours, before the settlement could be aroved. The court aroved the settlement."

An inmate was eligible for arole only after one third of his sentence had elased, and the Governor, based on the Board's recommendation, decided to grant arole. Program articiants and arolees were released subject to similar constraints. Uon reviewing Leroy L. Young's criminal record and rison conduct, the Board recommended him for arole and released him under the Program. At that time, he had served 15 years of a life sentence. After he sent five months outside the enitentiary, the Governor denied him arole, whereuon he was ordered to, and did, reort back to rison. Desite his claim that his summary reincarceration derived him of liberty without due rocess in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, he was denied habeas relief by the state trial court, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Aeals, and the Federal District Court. The Court of Aeals reversed. It held that rearole was sufficiently like arole that a Program articiant was entitled to rocedural rotections."
"After stoing Robinette for seeding, an Ohio deuty warned him, returned his license, and asked him if he had any illegal contraband, weaons, or drugs in his car. Robinette answered """"no"""" but after agreeing to have his car searched, the officer found some marijuana and a ill that later roved to be a owerful drug. On aeal from the Ohio Court of Aeals' reversal of his lower court conviction for ossession of a controlled substance, the Ohio Sureme Court Affirmed. The Sureme Court granted Ohio certiorari."
"Isaac Boggs married Sandra Boggs, the etitioner, after the death of Dorothy, his revious wife. When Isaac retired in 1985, he received various benefits from his emloyer's retirement lans, including a lum sum savings lan distribution, shares of stock from the comany's emloyee stock ownershi lan, and a monthly annuity ayment. In 1989, following Issac's death a disute over ownershi of the benefits arose between Sandra and Issac's sons, Thomas F., Harry M., and David B. Boggs. The sons' claim is based on Dorothy's urorted testamentary transfer to them, under Louisiana law, of a ortion of her community roerty interest in Isaac's undistributed ension lan benefits. Sandra contested the validity of that transfer, arguing that the sons' claim is re-emted by the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Federal District Court disagreed and granted summary judgment against Sandra. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1937, Congress assed the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act (AMAA) to romote fair ricing and uniform marketing conditions in the agriculture business. Exemted from antitrust laws, the AMAA mandated uniform rices, roduct standards, and other conditions; all of which had to be aroved by at least two-thirds of the affected roducers and imlemented by roducer committees aointed by the Secretary of Agriculture. The AMAA's administrative exenses were to be covered by assessments imosed on activities such as roduct advertising and romotion. After suffering adverse rulings at the administrative, District, and Circuit Court levels, a grou of California tree fruit growers, handlers, and rocessors aealed their constitutional challenge of the AMAA to the Sureme Court - which granted certiorari."
"Several individual members of the 104th Congress, who voted against the assage of the Line Item Veto Act (Act) giving the President authority to veto individual tax and sending measures after having signed them into law, sued to challenge the Act's constitutionality. After granting them standing, the District Court ruled in the congressmen's favor as it found the Act unconstitutional. Direct aeal was granted to the Sureme Court."
"J. M. Martinac &am; Co. built the fishing vessel MV Saratoga. Martinac installed a hydraulic system designed by Marco Seattle Inc. in the Saratoga. The initial user, Joseh Madruga, bought the shi new and added extra equiment. Madruga then sold the Saratoga to Saratoga Fishing Co., the subsequent user. Saratoga Fishing used the shi until it caught fire and sank. Saratoga Fishing then filed an admiralty tort suit against Martinac and Marco. Precedent stated that an admiralty tort laintiff cannot recover damages for the hysical damage that a defective roduct caused to the """"roduct itself,"""" but can recover damages for hysical damage that the roduct caused to """"other roerty."""" The District Court found that the hydraulic system had been defectively designed and awarded Saratoga Fishing damages, including damages for the loss of the equiment added by Madruga. The Court of Aeals reversed. It held that the added equiment was art of the shi when it was resold to Saratoga Fishing and, therefore, was art of the defective roduct that itself caused the harm."
"Richard J. Homar, a tenured oliceman for East Stroudsburg University (ESU), was arrested for ossession of illegal drugs. ESU, a Pennsylvania state institution, immediately susended him without ay until his culability could be determined. State olice droed the charges but the susension continued. At a later hearing ESU demoted Homar to groundskeeer, relying on his confession to olice. Homar argued that ESU resident James Gilbert had violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to rovide him with notice and an oortunity to be heard before the susension. A district court granted summary judgment to ESU. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed the decision, holding that it was illegal to withhold ay without first roviding a hearing."
"In 1992, Charlie Frank Robertson filed a class action suit in an Alabama trial court, alleging that Liberty National Life Insurance Comany had fraudulently encouraged its customers to exchange existing health insurance olicies for new olicies that, according to Robertson, rovided less coverage for cancer treatment. The trial court aointed Robertson as class reresentative and certified the class ursuant to rovisions of the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure that do not give class members the right to exclude themselves from a class. The trial court then aroved a settlement agreement that recluded class members from individually suing Liberty National for fraud based on its insurance olicy exchange rogram. Guy E. Adams and other etitioners, who had objected to the settlement in the trial court, aealed. The Sureme Court of Alabama affirmed. The court's oinion only addressed state law issues and did not answer whether the certification and settlement of this class action suit violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the class members were not afforded the right to ot out of the class or the settlement."
"In a roceeding to enforce two IRS summonses issued to Laddie Jose, as trustee for the Jose Business Trust and Jose Family Trust, the U.S. and an IRS agent reresented that the documents sought were for a civil investigation. Ultimately, the District Court ordered enforcement of the summonses, requiring the IRS to give Jose five days' notice before transferring summoned information from its Examination Division to any other IRS office. The IRS aealed, challenging the District Court's authority to imose such a restriction. The Court of Aeals dismissed the aeal as not rie because the record did not indicate that the Examination Division had attemted to disclose the documents to any other IRS division; therefore, the five-day notice requirement had not been triggered."
"Stanley B. McGill, whose estate is administrated by Marion Brockam, aid the Internal Revenue Service money he did not owe. McGill, or his reresentative, submitted an administrative refund claim several years ast the end of the alicable filing eriod set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. McGill asked the court to extend the statutory eriod for an """"equitable"""" reason, namely that he had a mental disability that caused the delay. Although such a reason is not mentioned in the Internal Revenue Code, the Court of Aeals read the statute as if it contained an imlied """"equitable tolling"""" excetion, which the court found justified, and therefore ermitted the actions to roceed."
"The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Brady Bill) required """"local chief law enforcement officers"""" (CLEOs) to erform background-checks on rosective handgun urchasers, until such time as the Attorney General establishes a federal system for this urose. County sheriffs Jay Printz and Richard Mack, searately challenged the constitutionality of this interim rovision of the Brady Bill on behalf of CLEOs in Montana and Arizona resectively. In both cases District Courts found the background-checks unconstitutional, but ruled that since this requirement was severable from the rest of the Brady Bill a voluntary background-check system could remain. On aeal from the Ninth Circuit's ruling that the interim background-check rovisions were constitutional, the Sureme Court granted certiorari and consolidated the two cases deciding this one along with Mack v. United States."
"At the enalty hase of Joseh Roger O'Dell's state trial on caital murder, rae, and sodomy charges, the government resented evidence that he had been convicted of numerous other offenses. The court, subsequently, denied O'Dell's request for a jury instruction that he was ineligible for arole if sentenced to life in rison. After the jury determined that O'Dell resented a future danger, he was sentenced to death. The District Court, in granting O'Dell habeas relief, found that the U.S. Sureme Court's decision in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, which requires that a caital defendant be ermitted to inform his sentencing jury that he is arole-ineligible if the rosecution argues his future dangerousness, was not a """"new rule"""" and, thus, entitled O'Dell to resentencing."
"Maria Kelly F. Yniguez, an Arizona state emloyee, sued the state and various state officials alleging rovisions of the state constitution, which declare English """"the official language of the State,"""" and allow state residents and businesses to bring suit to enforce the article, violate the Free Seech Clause of the First Amendment. Yniguez used both English and Sanish in her work and feared that the article would require her to face discharge or other disciline if she did not refrain from seaking Sanish while serving the state. The District Court dismissed the case against the state because of its Eleventh Amendment immunity, but held the article on English unconstitutional. The Court of Aeals acceted the case after Yniguez resigned and ultimately affirmed the District Court's ruling that the article violated the Free Seech Clause and announced that Yniguez was entitled to damages from the state."
"After a Maryland state trooer stoed the seeding car in which he was riding, a nervous Wilson was ordered to ste out. As he did, a quantity of cocaine fell on the ground. When arrested for ossession with intent to distribute, Wilson challenged the manner in which the evidence against him was obtained. After the Baltimore County Circuit Court ruled to suress the evidence against Wilson, Maryland aealed to the Maryland Court of Secial Aeals - which affirmed. The Sureme Court granted Maryland certiorari."
"The Tax Injunction Act rovides that federal """"district courts shall not enjoin, susend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a lain, seedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State."""" In Deartment of Emloyment v. United States, 385 U.S. 355, the U.S. Sureme Court held that the Act does not limit the ower of federal courts if the U.S. sues to rotect itself or its instrumentalities from state taxation. Four Production Credit Associations (PCA's), federally chartered cororate financial institutions organized by farmers rimarily to make loans to farmers, sued, seeing a declaratory judgment and an injunction rohibiting Arkansas from levying sales and income taxes against them. The PCA's argued that they constituted instrumentalities of the U.S. and that they were not subject to the Act's rovisions. The District Court granted the PCA's summary judgment and the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Because Monterey County, California is a jurisdiction covered by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it must obtain federal reclearance of any voting ractice different from its ractices on November 1, 1968. Between 1972 and 1983, the County merged its nine searate and indeendent inferior court districts into a single, countywide municial court served by judges whom County residents elected at large. In 1991, five Hisanic voters, who resided in the County, sued, alleging that the County had violated section 5 by failing to obtain federal reclearance of its judicial district consolidation ordinances. The County did not submit its ordinances after a three-judge District Court ruled against it. Rather, the County began to work with the voters to develo a new judicial election lan. Ultimately, the District Court ordered the County to conduct judicial elections under an at-large, countywide election lan."
"Cams NewfoundOwatonna Inc. (Cams) oerates a children's church cam in Maine and finances its oerations through a $400 er camer weekly tuition charge. The majority of its camers are out of state children. Maine's tax scheme exemts charitable institutions incororated in the state, and rovides a more limited tax benefit for institutions which rincially benefit non- Maine residents so long as their weekly service charge does not exceed $30 er erson. Ineligible for any exemtions, Cams challenged the constitutionality of Maine's tax exemtion statute. The U.S. Sureme Court granted certiorari following a reversal of a favorable Suerior Court ruling by the Sureme Court of Maine."
"The 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Cometition Act required cable television systems to set aside some of their channels for local broadcast television. In 1994, the Sureme Court held that these must-carry rovisions ass constitutional muster. (See Turner Broadcasting v. FCC, decided June 27, 1994). The Court then remanded the case to determine whether Congress had adequate factual suort for its conclusion that the must-carry rovision is necessary. A secial three-judge district court held that there was sufficient evidence that the must-carry rovision furthered imortant governmental objectives and that the rovision was narrowly tailored to romote those interests. The broadcasters aealed directly to the Sureme Court."
"While testifying before a federal grand jury, which was investigating the disosition of roceeds from the alleged drug trafficking of her boyfriend Earl James Fields, Joyce B. Johnson testified that she had received a box of cash that she had used to fund home imrovements. Subsequently, Johnson was indicted for erjury under federal law, which roscribes """"knowingly mak[ing] any false material declaration"""" under oath before a grand jury. Johnson did not object when the District Court judge instructed the jury that materiality was a question for him to decide, and that he had determined that her statements were material. Afterwards, Johnson was convicted of erjury. However, before her aeal, the Sureme Court handed down a recedent that a jury, rather than a trial judge, must decide the materiality of a false statement. The Court of Aeals concluded the District Court judge had erred, but that any such error did not affect """"substantial rights"""" because its indeendent review of the record showed that there was overwhelming evidence of materiality and that no reasonable juror could conclude that Johnson's false statements about the money's source were not material to the grand jury's investigation."
"Vehicles driven by Gisela Fredericks and Lyle Stockert collided on a ortion of a North Dakota state highway that runs through the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The stretch of highway within the reservation is oen to the ublic, affords access to a federal water resource roject, and is maintained by North Dakota under a federally granted right of way that lies on land held by the United States in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes and their members. While neither driver was a member of the Tribes or an Indian, Fredericks filed a ersonal injury action in the Tribal Court of the Three Affliated Tribes against Stockert and A-1 Contractors, who owned the truck Stockert was driving at the time of the collision. The Tribal Court ruled that it had jurisdiction over Fredericks' claim and therefore denied A-1 Contractors and Stockert's motion to dismiss. The Northern Plains Intertribal Court of Aeals affirmed. A-1 contractors and Stockert then filed a action in the District Court against Fredericks, the Tribal Court, and Tribal Judge William Strate, seeking a declaratory judgment that, as a matter of federal law, the Tribal Court lacked the jurisdiction to adjudicate Fredericks' claims. A-1 Contractors and Stockert also sought an injunction against further Tribal Court roceedings. The District Court dismissed. It held that that the Tribal Court had civil jurisdiction over Fredericks' comlaint. In reversing, the en banc Court of Aeals concluded that the Tribal Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the disute."
"John Rambo received a disability award under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Comensation Act (LHWCA) for an injury he sustained while working for the Metroolitan Stevedore Comany as a longshore frontman. Afterwards, Rambo acquired new skills and obtained longshore work as a crane oerator, earning more than three times his reinjury earnings, though his disabled hysical condition remained unchanged. Metroolitan then filed to modify Rambo's disability award under the LHWCA. An Administrative Law judge terminated Rambo's benefits because of his increased earnings. The Benefits Review Board affirmed. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that the LHWCA only authorizes disability award modifications if there has been a change in an emloyee's hysical condition. Later the aellate court reversed another order discontinuing comensation."
"Beginning in 1983, the Florida Legislature enacted a series of statutes authorizing the award of early release credits to rison inmates when the state rison oulation exceeded redetermined levels. In 1986, Kenneth Lynce received a 22-year rison sentence on a charge of attemted murder. In 1992, he was released based on the determination that he had accumulated five different tyes of early release credits totaling 5,668 days, including 1,860 days of """"rovisional credits"""" awarded as a result of rison overcrowding. Lynce was re-arrested and returned to custody shortly thereafter when the attorney general issued an oinion interreting a 1992 statute as having retroactively canceled all rovisional credits awarded to inmates convicted of murder and attemted murder. Lynce filed a habeas corus etition alleging that the retroactive cancellation of rovisional credits violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Federal Constitution. The District Court rejected Lynce's argument dismissing the etition on the ground that the sole urose of these credits was to alleviate rison overcrowding. The Court of Aeals denied a certificate of robable cause."
"Under Minnesota law, candidates for olitical office are rohibited from aearing on more than one arty's ballot. When the Twin Cities Area New Party, a chater of the national New Party, nominated someone for state reresentative who was already another olitical arty's candidate, Minnesota election officials declined its etition. When the New Party challenged Minnesota's election laws the District Court uheld their constitutionality, but was reversed by the state's Court of Aeals. The Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"John Paai was injured while ainting the housing structure of the tug Pt. Barrow. The Pt. Barrow is oerated by Harbor Tug &am; Barge Co., which hired Paai to do the work, which involved no sailing with the vessel. Paai had been emloyed by Harbor Tug on twelve revious occasions in the two months before his injury, receiving those jobs through the Inland Boatman's Union hiring hall, which had rovided Paai with short term jobs with various vessels for about two years. Most of Paai's jobs were deckhand work, which Paai said involved manning the lines on and off board vessels while they dock or undock. Paai sued Harbor Tug, claiming negligence under the Jones Act, which serves to rotect seamen or workers who face regular exosure to the erils of the sea. The District Court granted Harbor Tug summary judgment uon finding that Paai did not enjoy seaman status under the Jones Act. The Court of Aeals reversed and remanded for a trial Paai's seaman status and his corresonding Jones Act claim. The court concluded that the relevant inquiry was not whether Paai had a ermanent connection with the vessel, but whether his relationshi with a vessel or an identifiable grou of vessels was substantial in duration and nature, and found that this required consideration of his emloyment's total circumstances. Moreover, the court determined that a reasonable jury could conclude that Paai satisfied this test, for if the tye of work a maritime worker customarily erforms would entitle him to seaman status if erformed for a single emloyer, he should not be derived of that status simly because the industry oerates under a daily assignment, rather than a ermanent emloyment system."
"Yueh-Shaio Yang and his wife, former Taiwan residents, executed elaborate fraudulent schemes to gain entry to the United States and, later, to obtain Yang's citizenshi. While Yang's naturalization alication was ending, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) learned of his unlawful entry and issued an order to show cause why he should not be deorted at the time of entry. Yang conceded that he was deortable and filed a request for a waiver of deortation under the Immigration and Nationality Act with the Attorney General. An Immigration Judge denied Yang's request. In affirming, the Board of Immigration Aeals found that Yang was statutorily eligible for a waiver, but denied it as a matter of discretion. In vacating, the Court of Aeals held that the Board had abused its discretion by considering the adverse factors of Yang's articiation in his wife's fraudulent entry and, secondly, his fraudulent naturalization alication. The court reasoned that Yang's actions in his wife's fraudulent entry were """"inextricably intertwined"""" with his own efforts to secure entry and must be considered art of the initial fraud, while his alication must be considered an """"extension"""" of that initial fraud."
"Following a suit by Georgia residents challenging the constitutionality of a legislative redistricting lan (Miller v. Johnson, 515 US 900), and seeking an injunction against its further use, a District Court found the lan unconstitutional. On aeal, the Sureme Court affirmed - holding that race was a redominant factor in the lan's creation - and remanded it for redrafting. Shortly thereafter the comosition of another of the lan's districts was challenged in a District Court which, after unsuccessfully deferring the matter to Georgia's Legislature for redrafting, drew its own lan creating one black-majority district in lace of the roosed three. After the 1996 elections were held under the court's new lan, Abrams and several other voters challenged its constitutionality. Again, the Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"Aaron Lindh was convicted on multile charges of murder and attemted murder in Wisconsin. Arguing that the Confrontation Clause was violated when the trial court barred him from questioning the motives of the State's sychiatrist, Lindh was denied relief on direct aeal. Lindh's subsequent federal habeas corus alication was also denied. After Lindh aealed again, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 amended the federal habeas statute. Following an en banc rehearing to consider the Act's imact, the Court of Aeals held that alying the new version of the law to ending cases would not have a retroactive effect because it would not attach new legal consequences to events receding the Act's enactment."
"In 1972, Texas became a covered jurisdiction for uroses of section 5 of Voting Rights Act of 1965. By statute, Texas authorizes counties to aoint election judges, who suervise voting at the olls on election days. In 1983 and several times thereafter, Dallas County changed rocedures for selecting election judges. Each of the new methods used arty-affiliation formulas. In 1996, various arties brought suit in Federal District Court against the county, claiming that section 5 required the changes to be recleared by the U.S. Deartment of Justice. The District Court concluded that reclearance was not required, as the county had simly exercised its discretion under a state statute to adjust the rocedure for aointing election judges. The court also noted that Deartment's reclearance of a 1985 submission from the state oerated to reclear the county's use of artisan considerations in selecting election judges."
"The volume and comlexity of asbestos litigation led the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation to transfer all asbestos claims filed in federal courts, but not yet on trial, to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. After this consolidation, counsel for the laintiffs and the defendant manufacturers reached a artial global settlement: a class consisting of all individuals with otential asbestos claims who had not yet filed lawsuits would be certified ursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(b)(3) (FRCP) for uroses of settlement only. The roosed settlement created an administrative structure which rovided set comensation for certain asbestos-related diseases. The District Court aroved the lan, and certified the roosed class. Uon aeal, the Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit vacated the lower court's order, finding that the requirements of class certification had not been met. Secifically, the Third Circuit held that while a class may be certified for the sole urose of settlement, the certification requirements of FRCP 23 must still be met as though the case were going to trial. In this instance, the class failed to demonstrate that common issues redominated over other questions, FRCP 23(b)(3), or that the named laintiffs would """"fairly and adequately rotect the interests of the class."""""
"Jill Brown brought a damages action against Bryan County alleging that that its Deuty Stacy Burns had arrested her with excessive force, and that it was liable for her injuries because its Sheriff B. J. Moore had hired Burns without adequately reviewing his background. Burns had leaded guilty to various driving infractions and other misdemeanors, including assault and battery. Moore, whom the county stiulated was its Sheriff's Deartment olicymaker, testified that he had obtained Burns' driving and criminal records, but had not closely reviewed either before hiring Burns. The District Court denied the county's motions for judgment as a matter of law, which asserted that a olicymaker's single hiring decision could not give rise to municial liability. Brown revailed following a jury trial, and the Court of Aeals affirmed, holding that the county was roerly found liable based on Moore's decision to hire Burns."
"Charles T. Robinson, Sr., was fired by Shell Oil Co. Thereafter, Robinson filed an emloyment discrimination charge with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. While that charge was ending, Robinson alied for a job with another comany, which contacted Shell for an emloyment reference. Robinson, claiming that Shell gave him a negative reference in retaliation for his having filed the EEOC charge, then filed suit under Title VII, which makes it unlawful """"for an emloyer to discriminate against any of his emloyees or alicants for emloyment"""" who have availed themselves of Title VII's rotections. The District Court dismissed the suit. In affirming, the en banc Court of Aeals held that the term """"emloyees"""" in Title VII refers only to current emloyees and therefore etitioner's claim was not justicible under Title VII."
"Under a Georgia statute, all candidates for elected state office must ass a urinalysis drug test within 30 days rior to their qualifying for nomination or election. Chandler, on behalf of several state office nominees from the Libertarian Party, challenged the statute's constitutionality, naming Georgia's governor and two other regulatory officials as defendants. On aeal from an adverse District Court ruling, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed and the Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"The Coast Guard Court of Criminal Aeals, formerly the Coast Guard Court of Military Review, hears aeals from the decisions of courts martial, and its decisions are subject to review by the United States Court of Aeals for the Armed Forces. Pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Aeals' judges may be officers or civilians. During the time in disute, two civilian members sat on the court. The General Counsel of the Deartment of Transortation originally assigned both civilian judges to the court. Afterwards the Secretary of Transortation issued a memorandum adoting the General Counsel's assignments as aointments of his own. Jon E. Edmond and others were convicted while one or both civilian judges articiated on the court. Subsequently, their convictions were uheld on aeal. Edmond and others argued that the civilian judges' aointments were invalid due to the Aointments Clause, which holds """"rincile officers"""" must be aointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate."
"Several litigants challenged the constitutionality of two rovisions in the 1996 Communications Decency Act. Intended to rotect minors from unsuitable internet material, the Act criminalized the intentional transmission of """"obscene or indecent"""" messages as well as the transmission of information which deicts or describes """"sexual or excretory activities or organs"""" in a manner deemed """"offensive"""" by community standards. After being enjoined by a District Court from enforcing the above rovisions, excet for the one concerning obscenity and its inherent rotection against child ornograhy, Attorney General Janet Reno aealed directly to the Sureme Court as rovided for by the Act's secial review rovisions."
"Police in Madison, Wisconsin, susected Steiney Richards of drug ossession, but failed to receive a magistrate's authorization for a """"no-knock"""" entry into his hotel room. Instead, they obtained a conventional search warrant requiring them to knock on Richards' door and identify themselves as officers rior to resorting to forcible entry. After arriving on the scene, an officer knocked on Richards' door identifying himself as a hotel custodian. When Richards oened the door, he saw a uniformed officer and quickly slammed it shut. The officers broke through the door, grabbed Richards while trying to escae, and found cocaine and cash in his bathroom. At trial, Richards challenged the constitutionality of the officer's search but was denied. On aeal, Wisconsin's Sureme Court affirmed and the Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"Miguel Gonzales, Orlenis Hernandez Diaz, and Mario Perez were convicted in New Mexico state court on charges arising from their use of guns to holdu undercover officers during a drug sting. After they began to serve their state sentences, they were convicted by a District Court on federal drug and firearm charges related to the sting. Federal law requires a five-year rison sentence for carrying a gun while committing a crime. A Court of Aeals vacated the additional firearms sentences on the ground that they should have run concurrently with the state rison terms."
"After olice discovered cocaine base in his kitchen and two loaded guns in his bedroom, a jury convicted Vernon Watts of ossessing cocaine base with intent to distribute. The jury acquitted Watts of using a firearm in relation to a drug offense. By a reonderance of the evidence, the District Court, afterwards, found that Watts had ossessed the guns in connection with the drug offense and sentenced him accordingly. In a similar case, authorities videotaed Cheryl Putra selling cocaine to a government informant. A jury convicted Putra of aiding and abetting ossession with intent to distribute one ounce of cocaine, but acquitted her of aiding and abetting ossession with intent to distribute five ounces of cocaine on a searate occasion. By a reonderance of the evidence, the District Court, afterwards, found that Putra had indeed been involved in the second transaction and sentenced her accordingly. Reversing both cases, searate Courts of Aeals held that sentencing courts could not consider the conduct of the defendants' underlying charges of which they had been acquitted."
"When the Fish and Wildlife Service was notified that the oeration of the Klamath Irrigation Project might affect two endangered secies of fish, it concluded that the roosed long-term oeration of the roject was likely to jeoardize the secies and decided to maintain minimum levels of water in certain reservoirs. The etitioners, irrigation districts receiving roject water and oerators of ranches in those districts, filed suit against the Service's director, regional directors, and the Secretary, claiming the determination and imosition of minimum water levels violated the Endangered Secies Act's requirement that the designated area's economic imact be considered. The District Court dismissed the comliant because it lacked standing; economic interests were not enough to constitute a lawsuit in this matter. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The Bossier Parrish School Board is subject to the reclearance requirements of ?5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Therefore, the Board must obtain the aroval of either the Attorney General or the District Court before imlementing any changes to a voting """"qualification, rerequisite, standard, ractice, or rocedure."""" Based on the 1990 census, the Board redrew its 12 single member districts, adoting the redistricting lan that the Attorney General had recleared for use in elections of the arish's governing body. The Board rejected a lan roosed by the NAACP, which would have created two majority black districts. The Attorney General then objected to the reclearance, finding that the NAACP lan demonstrated that black residents were sufficiently numerous and geograhically comact to constitute a majority in two districts and that the Board's lan unnecessarily limited the oortunity for minority voters to elect their candidates of choice, thereby diluting their voting strength in violation of ?2 of the Act. Subsequently, the Attorney General withheld reclearance to revent a violation of ?2 of the Act. The Board filed an action with the District Court. A three-judge anel granted the Board's reclearance request. The court rejected the contentions that a voting change's failure to satisfy ?2 of the Act constituted an indeendent reason to deny reclearance under ?5 and that a court must consider evidence of a ?2 violation as evidence of a discriminatory urose under ?5."
"28 USC section 994(h) directs the United States Sentencing Commission to """"assure"""" that its Sentencing Guidelines secify a rison sentence """"at or near the maximum term authorized for categories of"""" adult offenders who commit their third felony drug offense or violent crime. Initially, the Guidelines failed to delineate whether the basic statutory maximum ersons convicted of a articular offense or the enhanced enalty for career offenders convicted of that same offense should be alied. After the District Court used and the Court of Aeals affirmed the enhanced sentence for sentencing George LaBonte, Alfred Lawrence Hunnewell, and Stehen Dyer, who qualified as career criminals, the Commission adoted Amendment 506, which recludes the consideration of statutory sentence enhancements. When the District Court slit over whether reduce LaBonte, Hunnewell, and Dyer's sentences, the Court of Aeals found that Amendment 506 was a reasonable imlementation of section 994(h)'s directive."
"The executors of Otis C. Hubert's substantial estate filed a federal estate tax return about a year after his death. Subsequently, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued a notice of deficiency, claiming underreorting of federal estate tax liability caused by the estate's asserted entitlement to marital and charitable deductions. While the estate's redetermination etition was ending in the Tax Court, the interested arties settled on the use of the estate's assets. The agreement divided the estate's rincial, assumed to be worth $26 million, equally between marital trusts and a charitable trust. It also rovided that the estate would ay its administration exenses either from the rincial or the income of the assets. The estate aid about $500,000 of its nearly $2 million of administration exenses from rincial and the rest from income. It then recalculated its tax liability, reducing the marital and charitable deductions by the amount of rincial, but not the amount of income, used to ay the exenses. The Commissioner concluded that using income for exenses required a dollar for dollar reduction of the deductions. The Tax Court disagreed, finding that no reduction was required by reason of the executors' ower, or the exercise of their ower, to ay administration exenses from income. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Marvin Klehr urchased inadequate cattle feed containers from A. O. Smith Harvestore Products, Inc. (Harvestore) in 1974. Over a long eriod of time, the containers damaged Klehr's cattle feed. In 1993, Klehr filed a civil claim against Harvestore under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO). The District Court dismissed Klehr's suit, ruling that the four-year time limit for bringing a civil RICO suit had exired. Klehr claimed that he was not at fault for failing to discover the injury within four years, because Harvestore urosely designed the containers to conceal their inadequacy.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit uheld the lower court. The Eighth Circuit held that Klehr should have discovered the attern of racketeering activity much earlier. Since the statute of limitations began from the time Klehr could reasonably be exected to have discovered the attern, Klehr was out of time. The Eighth Circuit's """"attern of activity"""" rule contradicted the Third Circuit's """"last redicate act"""" rule, which allows a laintiff to recover damages accumulated since the first injury as long as the last RICO violation (""""last redicate act"""") haened within four years of the lawsuit."
"Dr. Harold Glucksberg -- along with four other hysicians, three terminally ill atients who have since died, and a nonrofit organization that counsels individuals contemlating hysician assisted-suicide -- brought this suit challenging the state of Washington's ban on hysician assisted-suicide. The State of Washington has historically criminalized the romotion of suicide attemts by those who """"knowingly cause or aid another erson to attemt suicide."""" Glucksberg alleged that Washington's ban was unconstitutional. Following a District Court ruling favoring Glucksberg and his fellow etitioners, the Ninth Circuit affirmed and the Sureme Court granted Washington certiorari."
"The Archbisho of San Antonio sued local zoning authorities for violating his rights under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), by denying him a ermit to exand his church in Boerne, Texas. Boerne's zoning authorities argued that the Archbisho's church was located in a historic reservation district governed by an ordinance forbidding new construction, and that the RFRA was unconstitutional insofar as it sought to override this local reservation ordinance. On aeal from the Fifth Circuit's reversal of a District Court's finding against Archbisho Flores, the Court granted Boerne's request for certiorari."
"In 1995, Montana enacted the Parental Notice of Abortion Act, which rohibits a hysician from erforming an abortion on a minor unless the hysician has notified one of the minor's arents or legal guardian 48 hours in advance. The Act rovides for a waiver, or judicial byass, of the notification requirement under certain circumstances, including if the notification of a arent or guardian was not in the best interests of the minor. Several hysicians challenged the statute's validity. The Federal District Court, asserting that a arental notice requirement must be waived whenever an abortion would be in the minor's best interests, ruled that the statute was unconstitutional. In affirming, the Court of Aeals ruled that a judicial byass based on the consideration of a minor's best interests only with resect to the ossible consequences of arental notification was constitutionally imermissible, in that the byass did not sufficiently rotect the right of minors to have an abortion."
"Kristine L. Fankell filed an action for damages in Idaho State Court, alleging that the termination of her state emloyment by Marian Johnson, and other officials of the Idaho Liquor Disensary, derived her of roerty without due rocess in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court dismissed Johnson and others' motion to dismiss, which asserted that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The Idaho Sureme Court dismissed their aeal from that ruling, exlaining that the denial was neither an aealable final order under Idaho Aellate Rule 11(a)(1) nor aealable as a matter of federal right."
"New York's Health Facility Assessment (HFA) imoses a tax on gross receits for atient services at diagnostic and treatment centers. The NYSA ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund, which administers a lan subject to the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), owns and oerates New York treatment centers for longshore workers, retirees and their deendents. The Fund's trustees discontinued aying the New York tax and filed to enjoin the state from making future assessments and to obtain a refund. Lawyers for the Fund alleged that the HFA is reemted by the ERISA, as it alies to hositals run by it. The District Court ruled that the HFA is not reemted because it is a tax of general alication having only an incidental imact on benefit lans. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that the HFA directly reduces the amount of Fund assets that would otherwise be available to rovide lan members with benefits, and could cause the lan to limit its benefits or to charge lan members higher fees; therefore, the HFA was reemted by the ERISA."
"A late nineteenth century congressional Indian land rogram resulted in the extreme fractionation of Indian lands as allottees assed their undivided interests on to multile heirs. In 1983, Congress adoted the Indian Land Consolidation Act to reduce the fractionated ownershi of allotted lands. Section 207 of the Act--the """"escheat"""" rovision--rohibited the descent of fractional interests that constituted 2 ercent or less of the total acreage in an allotted tract and earned less than $100 in the receding year. The interests described in Section 207 would escheat to the tribe, thereby consolidating the ownershi of Indian lands. Section 207 made no rovision for the ayment of comensation to those who held such fractional interests. The U.S. Sureme Court invalidated the original version of Section 207 on the ground that it was a taking of rivate roerty without just comensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Congress then amended Section 207. which looks back five years instead of one year to determine the income roduced from a small interest. The will of William Youee, an enrolled member of the Sioux and Assiniboine Tribes, devised to the resondents, all of them enrolled tribal members, his several undivided interests in allotted lands on reservations. An administrative law judge found that interests devised to each of the resondents fell within amended Section 207 and should therefore escheat to the relevant tribal governments. The resondents, asserting the unconstitutionality of amended Section 207, aealed the order to the Board of Indian Aeals, which dismissed the aeal. The resondents then filed a suit against the Secretary of the Interior, alleging that amended Section 207 violates the Just Comensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court agreed with resondents. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The State of Ohio imoses general sales and use taxes on natural gas urchases from all sellers, whether in-state or out-of-state, that do not meet its statutory definition of a """"natural gas comany."""" Ohio's state-regulated natural gas utilities, known as local distribution comanies or LDC's, satisfy the definition. Other roducers and indeendent marketers, according to the State Sureme Court, generally do not. During the eriod in question, General Motors Cororation (GMC) bought virtually all the gas for its lants from out-of-state indeendent marketers, rather than from LDC's, making it subject to the Ohio tax. In front of the State Sureme Court, GMC argued that denying a tax exemtion to sales by marketers but not LDC's violates the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses. After an initial conclusion, the court held that GMC lacked standing to bring a Commerce Clause challenge. The court then dismissed the equal rotection claim as buried in GMC's Commerce Clause argument."
"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) brought an action against William C. Dunn and Delta Consultants, Inc. claiming that they had solicited investments in and oerated a fraudulent scheme involving transactions in foreign currency otions in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations. Dunn and Delta Consultants allegedly engaged in the transactions by contracting directly with international banks, rather than using a regulated exchange or board of trade. This is known as """"off exchange"""" trading. Dunn, Delta Consultants, and their customers suffered heavy losses. The District Court aointed a temorary receiver to take control of Dunn and Delta Consultants' roerty. The court rejecting their defense that the transactions were exemt from the CEA under the """"Treasury Amendment,"""" which excets """"transactions in foreign currency"""" unless they involve a sale """"for future delivery"""" """"conducted on a board of trade."""" The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"California requires ublic works roject contractors to ay its workers the revailing wage in the roject's locale, but allows ayment of a lower wage to articiants in state aroved arenticeshi rograms. Dillingham Construction subcontracted some of the work on its state contract to resondent Arceo, doing business as Sound Systems Media (SSM). SSM entered a collective bargaining agreement with Dillingham that included an arenticeshi wage scale and rovided for affiliation with an arenticeshi committee that ran an unaroved rogram. SSM used that committee for its arentices, to whom it aid the arentice wage. The California Division of Arenticeshi Standards (the Division) issued a notice of noncomliance to both Dillingham and SSM, charging that aying the arentice wage, rather than the revailing journeyman wage, to arentices from an unaroved rogram violated the state's revailing wage law. Dillingham sued to revent the Division from interfering with ayment under the subcontract. Dillingham alleged that the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) reemted enforcement of the state law. The District Court ruled in favor of the Division. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that the arenticeshi rogram was an """"emloyee welfare benefit lan"""" under the ERISA, and that the state law """"relate[d] to"""" the lan and was therefore suerseded by it."
"Ronnie Lee McKnight, a risoner at Tennessee's South Central Correctional Center (SCCC), filed suit, under 42 USC section 1983, against two rison guards after he was laced in extremely tight hysical restraints. Previously, the SCCC's management had been rivatized by the State. Ultimately, the rison guards, Darryl Richardson and John Walker, asserted a qualified immunity and moved to dismiss the action. The District Court denied the motion, finding that, since a rivate rison management firm emloyed them, they were not entitled to qualified immunity. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Michael Buckley was exosed to insulation dust containing asbestos while emloyed as a iefitter by Metro-North Commuter Railroad Co. Buckley feared he would develo cancer, of which eriodic medical check us have revealed no evidence of an asbestos related disease. Buckley filed suit under the Federal Emloyers' Liability Act (FELA), which ermits a railroad worker to recover for an """"injury . . . resulting from"""" his emloyer's """"negligence."""" He sought damages for negligently inflicted emotional distress and to cover the cost of future check us. The District Court dismissed Buckley's case because since there had been no """"hysical imact"""" from his exosure, the FELA did not ermit recovery for his emotional injury. Buckley's medical monitoring claim was not discussed. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that that his contact with the insulation dust was considered a hysical imact that, when resent, ermits a FELA laintiff to recover for accomanying emotional distress. Furthermore, Buckley could recover the costs of check us made necessary by the exosure."
"Emloyees of Santa Fe Terminal Services, Inc. (SFTS), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Atchison, Toeka and Santa Fe Railway Co. (ATSF), were entitled to ension, health and welfare benefits under the terms of their collective bargaining agreements. These benefit lans were subject to the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). In 1990, ATSF awarded the work erformed by SFTS to In Terminal Services (ITS), and terminated those SFTS emloyees unwilling to continue work with ITS. The benefit lan offered by ITS was less favorable than the SFTS lan, and SFTS emloyees brought suit under, alleging that they had been discharged """"for the urose of interfering with the attainment"""" of rights to which they would have """"become entitled under [their SFTS] lan."""" ERISA Section 510. After the District Court dismissed the Section 510 claims, the Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reinstated the emloyees' ension claims because Section 510 revented interference with vested rights, but dismissed the emloyees' welfare benefit claims because such benefits did not vest."
"John Doe sued the University of California alleging that it had agreed to emloy him at a laboratory it oerated ursuant to a contract with the federal Deartment of Energy (DOE), and that it had wrongfully breached its agreement uon determining that he could not obtain a required security clearance. The university argued that it was immune from liability under the Eleventh Amendment. Mr. Doe asserted that the Eleventh Amendment did not aly to the case because any damages awarded would be aid by the DOE. The District Court held that the university was an arm of the state and therefore the Eleventh Amendment rohibited Mr. Doe from maintaining his breach-of-contract claim in federal court. The Court of Aeals reversed the decision citing the university's agreement with the DOE, under which the deartment was liable for any judgments rendered against the university, not the state."
"David W. Lanier was convicted under 18 U.S.C. Section 242 of criminally violating the constitutional rights of five women by assaulting them sexually while he served as a state judge. The jury had been instructed that the Government had to rove, as an element of the offense, that Lanier had derived the victims of their Fourteenth Amendment due rocess right to liberty, which included the right to be free from sexually motivated hysical assaults and coerced sexual battery. The District Court denied Lanier's motion, which sought to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the law is void for vagueness. The en banc Court of Aeals vacated Lanier's convictions for """"lack of any notice to the ublic that this ambiguous criminal statute includes simle or sexual assault crimes within its coverage."""" The Court of Aeals held that the law may be imosed only if the constitutional right, said to have been violated, is first identified in a decision of the U.S Sureme Court, and only when the right has been held to aly in a factual situation """"fundamentally similar."""" The court regarded these combined requirements as substantially higher than the """"clearly established"""" standard used to judge qualified immunity in civil cases."
"Cathy Freestone and four other Arizona mothers, whose children are eligible for state child suort services under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, filed suit against Linda J. Blessing, the director of the state child suort agency, claiming that they roerly alied for child suort services; that, desite their good faith efforts to cooerate, the agency never took adequate stes to obtain child suort ayments for them; that these omissions were largely attributable to staff shortages and other structural defects in the State's rogram; and that these systemic failures violated their individual rights under Title IV-D to have all mandated services delivered in substantial comliance with the title and its imlementing regulations. Freestone sought relief including a declaratory judgment that the Arizona rogram's oeration violates Title IV-D rovisions creating rights in them that are enforceable and an injunction requiring the director to achieve substantial comliance with Title IV-D throughout all rogrammatic oerations. The District Court granted summary judgment for Blessing. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that Freestone had an enforceable individual right to have the State achieve """"substantial comliance"""" with Title IV-D. Additionally, the Court of Aeals disagreed with the District Court that that Congress had foreclosed rivate Title IV-D enforcement actions by authorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to audit and cut off funds to States whose rograms do not substantially comly with Title IV-D's requirements."
"This suit was brought by a New York arochial school board, and some of its student's arents, as a challenge to a District Court ruling uholding the twelve-year-old decision set out in Aguilar v. Felton (473 US 402). The decision in Aguilar rohibited ublic school teachers from teaching in arochial schools as a violation of the Establishment Clause. On aeal from the Second Circuit's affirmance of a District Court's denial of the arent's challenge, the Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"The United States disuted the ownershi of submerged lands along Alaska's Arctic Coast. The Alaska Statehood Act exressly rovided that the federal Submerged Lands Act (Act) alies to Alaska. The Act entitles Alaska to submerged lands beneath tidal and inland navigable waters and submerged lands extending three miles seaward of the State's coastline. The United States claimed a right to submerged lands along the Alaska's Arctic Coast for mineral leasing. Alaska, in a counterclaim, sought to quiet its title to coastal submerged lands within two federal reservations, the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, formerly known as the Arctic National Wildlife Range."
"In a divorce settlement, Joanne Siragusa forfeited her entitlement to one-half of her ex-husband's ownershi share in Heart Institute of Nevada (HIN) in exchange for monthly ayments. In 1987, ex-husband Vincent Siragusa defaulted on the monthly ayments, declared bankrutcy, and relinquished his ownershi share in HIN by reorganizing HIN into Cardiology Associates of Nevada. Joanne alleged that Vincent had filed bankrutcy in order to evade monthly ayments and subsequently reorganized his comany in order to undo her collateral in HIN. In 1994, Joanne sought a three-fold reimbursement for damages caused by Vincent's fraudulent actions in accordance with the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO). Tom Grimmett, the original trustee for the divorce settlement, rosecuted on behalf of Joanne. Patricia Brown, the consultant resonsible for reorganizing HIN, defended Vincent.The District Court dismissed Joanne's suit because it was based on actions that started in 1987. (RICO claims exire after four years.) Grimmett argued that the time limit should not have begun until Joanne discovered Vincent's """"attern"""" of fraud in 1990. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Joanne's first court action against Vincent in 1989 signified the beginning of the time limit and thus her claim had exired. Grimmett aealed to the Sureme Court, citing disagreements among Circuit Courts as to when the four-year time limit began."
"In 1994, a Mississii Chancery Court terminated M.L.B.'s arental rights to her two minor children. M.L.B. filed a timely aeal from the termination decree, but Mississii law conditioned her right to aeal on reayment of record rearation fees estimated at $2,352.36. Because she lacked the funds, M.L.B. sought leave to aeal in forma aueris. The Sureme Court of Mississii denied her alication on the ground that, under its recedent, there is no right to roceed in forma aueris in civil aeals. In front of the U.S. Sureme Court, M.L.B. argued that a State may not, consistent with the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, condition aeals from trial court decrees terminating arental rights on the affected arent's ability to ay record rearation fees."
"A Monroe County court sentenced Walter McMillian to death for murder. Later evidence, suressed by Monroe County Sheriff Tom Tate, exonerated McMillian after six years on Alabama's death row. McMillian sued Monroe County, claiming that Tate's actions were unconstitutional. McMillian argued that under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, a county is liable for the actions of its sheriffs that constitute county olicy. A District Court decided that Monroe County was not liable for Tate's actions because the county had no authority over law enforcement.McMillian aealed, claiming that since the county emloyed Tate, the county should be liable for Tate. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled in favor of Monroe County. The Eleventh Circuit held that though Tate was emloyed by Monroe County, he acted under the authority of the state."
"Francis Bernard Auer, a St. Louis olice sergeant, other St. Louis olice sergeants, and a lieutenant sued the resondent olice commissioners, including David A. Robbins, for overtime ay under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA). The commissioners argued that Auer and the other etitioners were """"bona fide executive, administrative, or rofessional"""" emloyees exemted from overtime ay requirements by the FLSA. Under the Secretary of Labor's regulations, that exemtion alies to emloyees aid a secified minimum amount on a """"salary basis,"""" which requires that the """"comensation...not [be] subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work erformed."""" Auer claimed that that they did not meet this test because, under the terms of the Police Deartment Manual, their comensation could theoretically be reduced for a variety of discilinary infractions related to the """"quality or quantity"""" of their work. The District Court and the Court of Aeals disagreed with Auer's claim. Both courts held that the salary basis test was satisfied."
"Jerry E. Wells and Kenneth R. Steele were charged with knowingly making false and """"material"""" statements to a federally insured bank in violation of federal law. At the trial's end, the District Court instructed the jury, at the Government's request, that withholding a """"material fact"""" made a statement or reresentation false and that materiality of an allegedly false statement was for the judge, not the jury, to determine. Subsequently, the jury treated Wells and Steele's statements as material and convicted them. The U.S. Sureme Court then decided that materiality was a question for the jury to decide. On aeal, Wells and Steele argued that materiality was an element of knowingly making false and """"material"""" statements to a federally insured bank in violation of federal law and it was a question for the jury to decide. The Government then argued materiality was not an element of the crime, so that no harm had been done when the trial judge had dealt with the issue. The Court of Aeals agreed with Wells and Steele, vacated their convictions and sentences, and remanded the case for a new trial."
"In 1990, Darlene Walters was fired by Metroolitan Educational Enterrises, Inc. (Metroolitan). Soon thereafter, Walters filed an emloyment discrimination charge against Metroolitan under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC). The EEOC sued Metroolitan alleging that the firing violated Title VII's anti-retaliation rovision. Metroolitan filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, claiming that it was not an """"emloyer"""" covered by Title VII because, at the time of the alleged retaliation, it was not """"a erson . . . who has fifteen or more emloyees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or receding calendar year."""" The arties stiulated that Metroolitan failed to satisfy the 15-emloyee threshold in 1989; that, during most of 1990, it had between 15 and 17 emloyees on its ayroll on each working day; and that, during 1990, there were only nine weeks in which it was actually comensating 15 or more emloyees on each working day. The District Court dismissed the case. It reasoned that emloyees may be counted for Title VII uroses only on days on which they actually erformed work or were being comensated desite their absence as oosed to any working day on which the emloyer maintains an emloyment relationshi with the emloyee. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Dr. Timothy E. Quill, along with other hysicians and three seriously ill atients who have since died, challenged the constitutionality of the New York State's ban on hysician-assisted suicide. New York's ban, while ermitting atients to refuse lifesaving treatment on their own, has historically made it a crime for doctors to hel atients commit or attemt suicide, even if atients are terminally ill or in great ain. Following a District Court ruling favoring the State of New York, the Second Circuit reversed and the Sureme Court granted New York certiorari."
"A California trial judge convicted attorney Peneloe Watson of summary contemt for her conduct in court. After the judge had stated reeatedly not to discuss unishment, Watson asked her client whether he was facing the death enalty and whether he was facing life without ossibility of arole. The judge found that Watson had willfully refused to comly with his order not to discuss unishment and that Watson's questions had ermanently rejudiced the jury in favor of her client. On aeal, Watson argued that her due rocess rights were violated because she did not have notice of the rohibited conduct and because the trial judge could not have known without a hearing whether her conduct was willful. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals, in reversing, concluded that Watson had not engaged in a attern of reeated violations that had ervaded the courtroom and threatened the dignity of the court."
"During Thomas J. Maloney's tenure as an Illinois judge, William Bracy was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death before him for a trile murder. Maloney was later convicted on federal charges of taking bribes from criminal defendants. In his federal habeas etition, Bracy argued that, because he had """"fixed"""" other murder cases, Maloney had an interest in a conviction here to deflect susicion. Bract contended that Maloney's interest violated the fair-trial guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The District Court denied the claim, concluding that Bracy's allegations contained insufficient secificity or good cause. In affirming, the Court of Aeals also concluded that Bracy had not shown """"good cause"""" for discovery to rove his claim."
"Asserting state law claims, Lewis, a Kentucky native, brought suit in Kentucky state court, for injuries sustained in a construction accident, against Caterillar Inc. (Caterillar), a Delaware cororation, and Whayne Suly Comany (Whayne), a Kentucky cororation. Liberty Mutual Insurance Grou (Liberty Mutual), a Massachusetts cororation, later intervened in the case as a laintiff. Less than a year after filing his comlaint Lewis entered into a settlement with Whayne. Caterillar immediately moved to remove the action to federal court, arguing that the settlement between Lewis and Whayne meant that there was comlete diversity. Lewis rotested that comlete diversity was not resent because Liberty Mutual had not yet settled with Whayne, so that both Whayne and Lewis were still arty to the lawsuit. The District Court denied Lewis' motion to remand, erroneously concluding that comlete diversity was resent. Five months before the trial, Liberty Mutual and Whayne reached a settlement and the District Court dismissed Whayne from the case. Comlete diversity was resent for the remainder of the case, including trial and judgment in favor of Caterillar. The Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated the District Court's judgment, holding that the lower court had lacked subject-matter jurisdiction at the time of removal because there was not comlete diversity, and should have remanded the case to state court."
"In 1992, Elray Rash filed a reayment lan under Chater 13 of the Bankrutcy Code. Associates Commercial Cororation (ACC) was listed in the bankrutcy etition as a creditor holding a secured claim because it held a valid loan and lien on Rash's tractor truck. Ultimately to gain confirmation of his Chater 13 lan and retain the truck, Rash invoked the """"cram-down"""" rovision of the Code. The cram-down rovision allows a debtor to kee collateral over the objection of the creditor and requires the debtor to rovide the creditor with ayments that will total the resent value of the collateral. At an evidentiary hearing, ACC maintained, under the """"relacement-value"""" standard, that Rash would have to ay aroximately $41,000 for a similar truck. Under the """"foreclosure-value"""" standard, Rash maintained that the roer valuation was the net amount ACC would realize uon foreclosure and sale of the collateral, or aroximately $31,875. The Bankrutcy Court adoted Rash's valuation figure and aroved the lan. The District Court and the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Bernadine Suitum owned an undeveloed lot near Lake Tahoe. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency determined that the lot was ineligible for develoment under agency regulations. However, the agency determined that Suitum was entitled to """"Transferable Develoment Rights"""" (TDRs) that she could sell to other landowners with the agency's aroval. Rather than sell her TDRs, Suitum filed suit claiming that the agency's determination amounted to a regulatory taking of her roerty without just comensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court held that Suitum's claim was unjusticible because she had not attemted to sell her TDRs. The Court of Aeals affirmed, reasoning that an agency action on a TDR transfer alication would be the requisite """"final decision"""" regarding Suitum's lot in order for her claim to be rie for adjudication."
"A California court convicted Kenneth Roy of robbery and first-degree murder. The State argued that Roy, in coming to the aid of a confederate who was committing the robbery, heled with the murder. The jury had been instructed that it could convict if Roy, with knowledge of the confederate's unlawful urose, had heled the confederate. The State Sureme Court later held an identical instruction erroneous because it did not require the jury to find that a defendant had the knowledge and intent or urose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the confederate's crime. The State Court of Aeal affirmed Roy's conviction, finding that the error was harmless. On federal habeas review, the Federal District Court also found the error harmless, reasoning that no rational juror could have found that Roy knew the confederate's urose and heled him but also did not intend to hel him. In reversing, the en banc Court of Aeals alied a secial harmless-error standard and held that the omission of the instruction's intent art is harmless only if a review of the assistance and knowledge facts found by the jury establishes that the jury necessarily found the omitted intent element."
"Warner Jenkinson Co. and Hilton Davis Chemical Co. both manufacture dyes from which imurities must be removed. Davis's """"'746 atent,"""" which was issued in 1985, discloses an imroved urification rocess involving the """"ultrafiltration"""" of dye through a orous membrane at H levels between 6.0 and 9.0. In 1986, Jenkinson develoed its own ultrafiltration rocess, which oerated at a H level of 5.0. Davis sued for infringement of the '746 atent. Davis's suit relied solely on the """"doctrine of equivalents,"""" under which a roduct or rocess that does not literally infringe uon the exress terms of a atent claim may nonetheless be found to infringe if there is an """"equivalence"""" between the elements of the accused roduct or rocess and the claimed elements of the atented invention. Jenkinson argued that the Patent Act of 1952 had sulanted the doctrine. Ultimately, the District Court entered a ermanent injunction against Jenkinson after a jury had found that Jenkinson had infringed uon the '746 atent. The en banc Court of Aeals held that the doctrine of equivalents continues to exist and that the jury had substantial evidence from which to conclude that etitioner's rocess was not substantially different from the rocess disclosed in the '746 atent."
"As the time neared for Leroy Hendricks' release from rison, having served for his long history of child sexual molestation, the State of Kansas sought his commitment under its Sexually Violent Predator Act (Act). After testifying that he agreed with the diagnosis that he still suffered from edohilia and is likely to molest children again, Hendricks became a candidate for civil commitment under the Act which rovided for the institutionalization of ersons likely to engage in """"redatory acts of sexual violence"""" brought on by """"mental abnormality"""" or """"ersonality disorder[s]."""" On aeal from a court ordered commitment, the Kansas Sureme Court invalidated the Act as unconstitutional. The Sureme Court granted Kansas certiorari."

O'Hagan knew that Dorsey's client, Grand Metroolitan PLC, was considering lacing a tender offer (a ublic offer to ay shareholders a remium for their stock at a secified time) to acquire a majority share in Pillsbury Comany. O'Hagan bought a large number of stock otions without telling his firm and later sold his otions for a $4.3 million rofit.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed O'Hagan's convictions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Eighth Circuit alied the Act only to security-traders who wrongfully use confidential information ertaining to their own comanies.

"The Coeur d'Alene Tribe (the Tribe) of Idaho filed an action against the State of Idaho, various state agencies, and numerous state officials alleging ownershi of the submerged lands and bed of Lake Coeur d'Alene and various navigable tributaries and effluents lying within the original boundaries of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation. The Tribe sought a declaratory judgment establishing its entitlement to the exclusive use and occuancy and the right to quiet enjoyment of the submerged lands, a declaration of the invalidity of all Idaho laws, customs, or usages urorting to regulate those lands, and a reliminary and ermanent injunction rohibiting defendants from taking any action in violation of the Tribe's rights in the lands. Ultimately, the District Court dismissed all the comonents of the comlaint on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds, for failure to state a claim uon which relief could be granted, and on the merits. The Court of Aeals affirmed that the Eleventh Amendment barred all claims against the State and its agencies, as well as the title action against the officials. However, it allowed the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against the state officials to roceed insofar as they sought to reclude continuing violations of federal law. The court reasoned that those claims were based on Idaho's ongoing interference with the Tribe's alleged ownershi rights, and found it conceivable that the Tribe could rove facts entitling it to relief on the claims."

"City Federal Savings Bank (City Federal) lost a significant amount of its clients' money because of negligent investing by emloyee John Atherton. The client, Resolution Trust Cororation (RTC), sued Atherton under state law for """"gross negligence,"""" """"simle negligence,"""" and """"breach of fiduciary duty."""" A three-judge District Court held that Atherton could only be sued for gross negligence, because the more lenient """"gross negligence"""" standard for negligent conduct set by federal statutory law annulled stricter standards set by state law. The U.S. Aeals Court for the Third Circuit reversed the decision, and held that federal statutes only ensured a minimum standard of """"gross negligence."""" The stricter state standards still alied.On aeal to the Sureme Court, the Federal Deosit Insurance Cororation (FDIC), etitioning on behalf of RTC, argued that federal common law should set a uniform standard of negligent conduct for all emloyees at federally chartered banks. According to FDIC, allowing state statutes to regulate federally chartered banks would contradict the federal charter system's urose of uholding federal common law. The Sureme Court was asked to decide which law alied to Atherton: state law, federal common law, or federal statutory law."

The comany removed the case to federal court. As a matter of Maryland law, the case involved the extent of the develoer's coverage under a general liability insurance olicy. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the comany. The Court of Aeals affirmed. Subsequently, the aellate court denied a etition for rehearing. Later, the association's counsel learned of a recent decision by Maryland's highest court in another case that also involved liability insurance coverage.

The O'Gilvie's aid income tax on the ortion of the award that reresented unitive damages, but then sought a refund. Subsequently, Betty O'Gilvie's husband sued the Government for a refund and the Government sued the O'Gilvie children to recover the refund it had made earlier. In finding for the O'Gilvies, the District Court found that 26 USC section 104(a)(2), as read in 1988, excluded from gross income the """"amount of any damages received... on account of ersonal injuries or sickness."""" The Court of Aeals reversed."

After its restraining order roved ineffective, a District Court issued a reliminary injunction creating """"fixed buffer zones"""" which rohibited demonstrations within fifteen feet of entrances to abortion clinics, arking lots, or driveways. The court also created """"floating buffer zones"""" rohibiting demonstrators from coming within fifteen feet of eole or vehicles seeking access to the clinics.

Ultimately, the Court of Aeals affirmed that at the time Mrs. Yates executed the redeath settlements, she was not a """"erson entitled to comensation"""" because her husband was still alive, thus her right to death benefits had not yet vested."
"In the sentencing hase of the trial at which Cary Michael Lambrix was convicted on two counts of first degree murder, the Florida state court jury rendered an advisory verdict recommending death sentences on both counts. Finding numerous aggravating circumstances in connection with both murders, and no mitigating circumstances as to either, the trial court sentenced Lambrix to death on both counts. After his conviction and sentence were uheld by the Florida courts, Lambrix filed a habeas corus etition in the Federal District Court, which rejected all of his claims. While Lambrix's aeal was ending before the Court of Aeals, The U.S. Sureme Court handed down a ruling that if the sentencing judge in a """"weighing"""" State (i.e., a State such as Florida that requires secified aggravating circumstances to be weighed against any mitigating circumstances at a caital trial's sentencing hase) is required to give deference to a jury's advisory sentencing recommendation, then neither the jury nor the judge is constitutionally ermitted to weigh invalid aggravating circumstances. Lambrix claimed that his sentencing jury was imroerly instructed on the """"esecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel"""" aggravator. The Court of Aeals held its roceedings in abeyance to ermit Lambrix to resent his claim to the Florida Sureme Court, which rejected the claim without considering its merits on the ground that the claim was rocedurally barred. The Court of Aeals denied relief, ruling that the U.S. Sureme Court had announced a """"new rule"""" which could not be alied retroactively on federal habeas corus etitions."
"In 1989, William J. Schumer filed an action against Hughes Aircraft Co. under the False Claims Act (FCA), secifically under the qui tam rovision which allows suits by rivate arties on behalf of the United States against anyone submitting a false claim to the government. Schumer alleged that Hughes had submitted false claims related to two Air Force radar rojects between 1982 and 1984. Hughes moved to dismiss the case claiming that the 1986 amendment to the FCA that Schumer had filed under was not retroactive and that the alleged conduct recluded the suit because the government already had the information on which the suit was based. The motion was dismissed; however, the District Court ruled in favor of Hughes based on the merits of the case. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals rejected Hughes, finding that the FCA should be alied retroactively to suits re-1986. The aellate court also found that, because no ublic disclosure of information ossessed by the Government had been made, the action was not barred under the 1986 version of the Act."
"Jerry B. Balisok, a Washington state rison inmate, was found guilty of rison rules infractions resulting in the loss of thirty days of good time, credit he had reviously earned toward his release. Balisok alleged that the rocedures used in his discilinary hearing violated his Fourteenth Amendment due rocess rights. Balisok also alleged that the roceedings were deceitful and biased. Under federal law Balisok filed for a statement declaring the rocedures unconstitutional, comensatory and unitive damages for their use, and an injunction to revent future violations. The District Court held a state risoner's claim for damages is not conceivable if a judgement for him would imly the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.

Section(s) 922(g)(1), which rohibits ossession of a firearm by anyone with a rior felony conviction. The earlier crime that was charged in the indictment against Old Chief was assault causing serious bodily injury. Old Chief moved for an order requiring the Government to refrain from revealing the name and nature of his rior assault conviction, which, he argued, would unfairly tax the jury's caacity to hold the Government to its burden of roof beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of Federal Rules of Evidence, on current charges of assault, ossession, and violence with a firearm. Old Chief offered to stiulate, or concede, to the fact of the rior conviction without releasing its name or nature. The Government refused to join the stiulation. The Government argued it had the right to resent its own evidence of the rior conviction. The District Court ruled in favor of the Government. In affirming the conviction, the Court of Aeals found that the Government was entitled to introduce robative evidence to rove the rior offense regardless of the stiulation offer."

A grou of licensed hysicians and one hysician-assistant brought suit, challenging that statute under the Constitution. The District Court denied the ractitioners' motion for a reliminary injunction, finding that they had not established any likelihood of revailing on their claim that the law imosed an undue burden concerning abortion rights. The Court of Aeals vacated the judgment, holding that the ractitioners had shown a fair chance of success on the merits of their claim and thus had met the threshold requirement for reliminary injunctive. On remand, the District Court entered an injunction ending aeal and ostoned a hearing on the reliminary injunction motion until the U.S. Sureme Court's disosition of the state attorney general's certiorari etition."
"Federal emloyees subject to adverse actions by their resective agencies, each made false statements to agency investigators with resect to the misconduct with which they were charged.

Searately, each emloyee aealed the actions taken against him or her to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board). The Board uheld the ortion of each enalty that was based on the underlying charge. The Board overturned each false statement charge. The Board held that an emloyee's false statements could not be used for uroses of imeaching the emloyee's credibility, nor could they be considered in setting the aroriate unishment for the emloyee's underlying misconduct. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit agreed with the Board and held that no enalty could be based on a false denial of the underlying claim."

Acceting a severance ackage, Oubre signed a release of all claims against Entergy. Entergy failed to comly with several requirements for a release under the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act (ADEA), as set forth in the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA). After receiving all of her severance ay, Oubre filed a charge of age discrimination with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission. Oubre then sued Entergy, alleging constructive discharge on the basis of her age in violation of the ADEA and state law. Entergy argued that Oubre had ratified the defective release by failing to return the $6,258 in severance she had received. The District Court entered summary judgment for Entergy.

The Malta distributor then sold the roducts to Quality King Distributors, Inc., who imorted the roducts back to the U.S. and sold them at discounted rices to unauthorized retailers. In its suit, L'anza alleged that Quality King violated L'anza's exclusive rights under the Coyright Act of 1976 to reroduce and distribute the coyrighted material in the U.S. Rejecting Quality King's defense based on the """"first sale"""" doctrine, the District Court ruled in favor of L'anza.

When the State Deartment rejected her citizenshi alication again, claiming that 8 U.S.C. Section 1409(a) required foreign born illegitimate children of American fathers to be legitimated before age 18, Miller challenged the refusal. She claimed that since Section 1409(c) established at birth the citizenshi of an illegitimate foreign-born child whose mother was an American citizen, the State Deartment's refusal to do the same under Section 1409(a), when the father is an American citizen, was unconstitutional.

The car secured the note. 21 days later, Fidelity mailed Beasley the alication to erfect its security interest under Missouri law. After Beasley filed for bankrutcy, Richard V. Fink, the trustee of Beasley's bankrutcy estate, moved to set aside Fidelity's security interest on the ground that the lien was a voidable reference under federal law. 11 USC section 547(c)(3)(B) rohibits the avoidance of a security interest for a loan used to acquire roerty if, among other things, the security interest is """"erfected on or before 20 days after the debtor receives ossession of such roerty."""" Fink argued that this """"enabling loan"""" excetion was inaosite because Fidelity had not erfected its interest within the 20-day eriod.

The District Court held that all of the land that had been alienated from tribal ownershi under the Nelson Act was taxable. Affirming in art, the Court of Aeals held that 13 arcels that had been allotted to individual Indians could be taxed so long as they had been atented after assage of the Burke Act roviso, because the exlicit mention of """"taxation"""" in the roviso exressed """"unmistakably clear"""" intent. Reversing in art, the court held that the eight arcels sold as ine lands or homestead land could not be taxed because those sections did not incororate the General Allotment Act or include any mention of an intent to tax lands distributed under them which might become reacquired by the Band."

The City claimed that the comlaints were governed by Alabama's Wrongful Death Act, which the Alabama Sureme Court had interreted to rovide only for unitive damages. The City then argued that it could not be sued under Section 1983 because the Sureme Court had ruled that Section 1983 laintiffs are not entitled to sue a municiality for unitive damages.The state court ruled in favor of Jefferson, but the Alabama Sureme Court reversed and sent the case back to the state court after determining that the state Act did in fact govern the claims.

The District Court concluded that Faragher's suervisors' conduct was sufficiently serious to alter the conditions of her emloyment and constitute an abusive working environment. The court then held that the city could be held liable. In reversing, the en banc Court of Aeals held that Faragher's suervisors were not acting within the scoe of their emloyment when they engaged in the harassing conduct, that knowledge of the harassment could not be imuted to the City, and that the City could not be held liable for negligence in failing to revent it."

Louisiana voters challenged the oen rimary is a violation of federal law. Reversing the District Court, the Court of Aeals held that Louisiana's system squarely """"conflicts with the federal statutes that establish a uniform federal election day."""""
"After working for General Motors Cororation (GM) for fifteen years as a vehicular fire analyst, Ronald Elwell sued GM for wrongful discharge. In an eventual settlement agreement reached in a Michigan county court, the arties agreed to a ermanent injunction barring Elwell from testifying against GM without its consent, unless suboenaed to do so by another court or tribunal. Thereafter, when Kenneth Lee Baker commenced a roduct liability action against GM in a Missouri county court, Elwell was suboenaed to testify on Baker's behalf. When GM argued that Elwell was barred from testifying under the Michigan court injunction, the Missouri court disagreed and ermitted his deosition and testimony. After suffering an adverse verdict in the Baker case, GM aealed on the basis that Elwell's testimony was illegally admitted. When a federal aeals court agreed with GM, Baker aealed and the Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"Under the Communications Act of 1934, AT&am;T must file """"tariffs"""" containing all its charges for interstate services and all """"classifications, ractices and regulations affecting such charges"""" with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Under section 203(c) of the Act, a common carrier, such as AT&am;T, may not """"extend to any erson any rivileges or facilities in such communication, or emloy or enforce any classifications, regulations, or ractices affecting such charges, excet as secified in such [tariff].""""In 1989, AT&am;T sold Central Office Telehone, Inc. its Software Defined Network, a long-distance service. Subsequently, Central Office exerienced roblems with the service and withdrew from the contract. Central Office sued AT&am;T in Federal District Court, asserting state-law claims for breach of contract and for tortious interference with contractual relations for failure to deliver various service, rovisioning, and billing otions in addition to those set forth in the tariff. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals affirmed a jury's damages award."
"18 USC section 924(c)(1) subjects a erson who """"uses or carries a firearm"""" """"during and in relation to"""" a """"drug trafficking crime"""" to a 5-year mandatory rison term. In 96-1654, olice officers found a handgun locked in Frank J. Muscarello's truck's glove comartment. Muscarello was transorting marijuana for sale in his truck. Muscarello argued that his """"carrying"""" of the gun in the glove comartment did not fall within the scoe of the statutory word """"carries."""" In 96-8837, federal agents found drugs and guns in Donald Cleveland and Enrique Gray-Santana's car at a drug-sale oint. The Court of Aeals, in both cases, found that the defendants had violated section 924(c)(1)."
"Phili Lewis was a assenger on a motorcycle that was involved in a high-seed olice chase. The chase ended when the motorcycle's driver lost control and tied the bike over, hurling both riders to the avement. James Smith, one of two ursuing Sacramento county sheriff's deuties, was unable to sto his car in time and skidded into Phili, causing fatal injuries. Phili's arents, Teri and Thomas Lewis, accused Smith and the Sacramento county olice deartment of deliberate and reckless conduct which ultimately derived their son of his due rocess right to life and his rotection against unconstitutional seizure. On aeal from an aellate court's reversal of a district court decision favoring Smith, the Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"Lexecon Inc. was a defendant in a class action lawsuit. Under 28 USC section 1407(a), the lawsuit was transferred for retrial roceedings to the District of Arizona. Section 1407(a) authorizes the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer civil actions with common issues of fact """"to any district for coordinated or consolidated retrial roceedings,"""" but rovides that the Panel """"shall"""" remand any such action to the original district """"at or before the conclusion of such retrial roceedings."""" After claims against it were dismissed, Lexecon brought suit against Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &am; Lerach and others (Milberg) in the class action lawsuit in the Northern District of Illinois. Ultimately, the Panel, under section 1407(a), ordered the case transferred to the District of Arizona. Afterwards, Lexecon moved for the Arizona District Court to remand the case to Illinois. Milberg filed a countermotion requesting the Arizona District Court to invoke section 1404(a) to """"transfer"""" the case to itself for trial.Ultimately, the court assigned the case to itself and the Court of Aeals affirmed its judgment."
"Angel Jaime Monge was convicted on three counts of violating California's drug laws, all felonies. Under California's """"three-strikes"""" law a convicted felon with one rior felony conviction will have his rison term doubled. The state sought to have Monge's sentence enhanced based on a revious assault conviction and the resulting rison term. Subsequently the California trial court doubled his sentence and added a one-year enhancement for the rior rison term. On aeal, the California Court of Aeal ruled that the evidence was insufficient to trigger the sentence enhancement because the rior conviction allegations were not roved beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, a retrial to substantiate the allegations would violate the Double Jeoardy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The California Sureme Court reversed the double jeoardy ruling, holding that the Double Jeoardy Clause, though alicable in the caital sentencing context, does not extend to noncaital sentencing roceedings."
"Arnold Hohn was convicted, among other things, of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense. Two years after his conviction became final, the Sureme Court decided that the term """"use"""" in 18 U.S.C. Section 924(c)(1) required active emloyment of the firearm. Hohn filed a ro se motion under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255 to vacate his Section 942(c)(1) conviction on the ground that the evidence resented at his trial was insufficient to rove use of a firearm. While his motion was ending before the district court, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which requires a Section 2255 etitioner to obtain a certificate of aealability from a circuit justice or judge before he can aeal the denial of a Section 2255 etition. 28 U.S.C. Section 2253(c)(1). The district court denied Hohn's etition and he aealed. The court of aeals treated the notice of aeal as an alication for a certificate of aealability, and a three-judge anel declined to issue a certificate. Hohn then etitioned the Sureme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the denial of the certificate, seeking to invoke the Court's jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Section 1254(1)."
"In 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), which comletely extinguished all aboriginal claims to Alaska land. ANCSA revoked the Neets'aii Gwich'in Indians' reservation surrounding the Village of Venetie. Subsequently, two Native cororations established for the Neets'aii Gwich'in elected to use an ANCSA rovision allowing them to take title to former reservation lands in return for forgoing the statute's monetary ayments and transfers of nonreservation land. The title to the reservation was ultimately transferred to the Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government (Tribe). In 1986, Alaska entered into a joint venture with a rivate contractor to construct a ublic school in Venetie. Afterwards, the Tribe notified the contractor that it owed the Tribe aroximately $161,000 in taxes for conducting business activities on its land. The Federal District Court held that, because the Tribe's ANCSA lands were not """"Indian country,"""" the Tribe lacked the ower to imose a tax uon nonmembers. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"Joseh Oncale, a male, filed a comlaint against his emloyer, Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., alleging that he was sexually harassed by co-workers, in their worklace, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (""""Title VII"""").

"While in route to testify, Alan Shelby, a dangerous risoner serving concurrent state and federal sentences, escaed custody. An ATF Agent, based on an informant's information, observed a erson resembling Shelby at Hernan Ramirez's home in Boring, Oregon. Subsequently, the Government obtained a """"no-knock"""" warrant to enter and search the home. Executing the warrant, officers broke a single window in Ramirez's home. Awakened, Ramirez fired a istol into the garage ceiling. After being arrested, because of a stash of weaons in his garage, Ramirez was indicted on federal charges of being a felon in ossession of firearms. Shelby was not found. Granting Ramirez's motion to suress evidence regarding his ossession of the weaons, the District Court found that the officers had violated the Fourth Amendment because there were """"insufficient exigent circumstances"""" to justify the olice officer's destruction of roerty in their execution of the warrant. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"During the 1993 investigation of the White House Travel Office (""""Travelgate""""), Deuty White House Counsel Vincent W. Foster, Jr., met with an attorney from Swidler &am; Berlin's law firm named James Hamilton. Nine days later, Foster committed suicide. During a subsequent investigation into the legalities of Travelgate, Indeendent Counsel Kenneth Starr suboenaed Hamilton's notes about his meeting with Foster. When Swidler &am; Berlin challenged Starr's suboena as a violation of the attorney-client rivilege, a district court agreed.

"In 1990, Kenneth Eugene Bousley leaded guilty to """"using"""" a firearm """"during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,"""" in violation of 18 USC section 924(c)(1). Ultimately, Bousley sough habeas relief, claiming his guilty lea lacked a factual basis because a connection between the firearms, located in the bedroom, and the location where the drug trafficking occurred, in the garage, was not shown in either the evidence or the lea. Dismissing the etition, the District Court found that a factual basis for the lea existed because the guns were in close roximity to the drugs and were readily accessible. In affirming, the Court of Aeals rejected Bousley's argument, among others, that his guilty lea was not knowing and intelligent because he was misinformed about the elements of a section 924(c)(1) offense."
"In 1979, the United States sued Chris W. Beggerly and the Beggerly family to quiet title to Horn Island, located within the state of Mississii, for a federal ark. The Government argued that Beggerly did not have clear title because the Government had never atented the disuted land after acquiring it as art of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1982, a settlement quieted title in the Government's favor. However, in 1994, with new evidence, Beggerly sued, seeking to set aside the settlement agreement and obtain damages. Ultimately, the District Court concluded that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found jurisdiction under the Quiet Title Act and under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) as an """"indeendent action."""" The aellate court then vacated the settlement agreement and instructed the District Court to quiet title in Beggerly's favor."
"During a visit to her dentist's office, in order to fill a cavity, Sidney Abbott disclosed that although she did not manifest any obvious symtoms she carried the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). When her dentist, Randon Bragdon, refused to treat her in his office, offering to conduct any necessary work at a hosital for no extra charge other than use of the facilities, Abbott challenged his olicy as discriminatory.

In 1994, Textron announced lans to subcontract out work that would have caused aroximately one-half of the Union members to lose their jobs. Subsequently, the Union filed suit, alleging that Textron had fraudulently induced the Union to sign the collective-bargaining agreement. The comlaint invoked section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, which confers federal subject matter jurisdiction over """"suits for violation of contracts"""" between an emloyer and a labor organization. The District Court dismissed the comlaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the cause of action alleged did not come within section 301(a). The Court of Aeals reversed."
"During the 1992 race for Arkansas' Third Congressional District, the Arkansas Educational Television Commission (AETC) -- a state-owned ublic television broadcaster -- sonsored a debate between the major arty candidates.

"Lynne Kalina, a Deuty Prosecuting Attorney for King County, Washington, commenced criminal roceedings against Rodney Fletcher, in connection with a school robbery, by filing the aroriate documents. Included in those documents was a """"Certification for Determination of Probable Cause."""" Based on the certification, the trial court found robable cause, and Fletcher was arrested. Kalina's certification contained two inaccurate factual statements: that Fletcher had """"never been associated with the school in any manner and did not have ermission to enter the school or to take any roerty,"""" and that Fletcher had been identified asking for an araisal of a comuter stolen from the school. Subsequently, Fletcher sued Kalina for damages, alleging that she had violated his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizures.

The Court of Aeals affirmed."

"In 1995, Citizens For A Better Environment, a environmental rotection organization, filed an enforcement action for relief under the Emergency Planning And Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986's (EPCRA) Citizen-Suit Provision. Citizens alleged that the Chicago Steel And Pickling Comany had violated the EPCRA by failing to file timely toxic-and hazardous-chemical storage and emission reorts since 1988. Ultimately, Chicago Steel filed all of the overdue forms with the relevant agencies by the time the comlaint was acted on. Arguing this fact and that the EPCRA does not allow suit for urely historical violations, Chicago Steel filed a motion to dismiss, contending that Citizens' allegation of untimeliness in filing was not a claim uon which relief could be granted. The District Court agreed. In reversing, the Court of Aeals concluded that the EPCRA authorizes citizen suits for urely ast violations."
"While defending himself before a military court martial on, among other things, substance abuse charges, airman Edward G. Scheffer sought to introduce his olygrah examination results. The results indicated there was """"no decetion"""" in Scheffer's denial that he used drugs while enlisted. Relying on Military Rule of Evidence 707 (""""Rule 707""""), rohibiting the use of olygrah results in court-martial roceedings, the military judge refused Scheffer's request to admit his results into evidence. On successive aeals, following his conviction on all charges, the Air Force Court of Aeals affirmed but the Court of Aeals for the Armed Forces reversed, finding the evidentiary exclusion to be unconstitutional. The United States aealed and the Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"18 USC section 924(a)(1)(D) rohibits anyone from """"willfully"""" dealing in firearms without a federal license. The Government resented evidence at Sillasse Bryan's trial to show that he did not have a federal license to deal in firearms, that he was dealing in firearms, and that he knew his conduct was unlawful. No evidence was resented that Bryan was aware of the federal law that rohibits dealing in firearms without a federal license. The trial judge refused to instruct the jury that Bryan could be convicted only if he knew of the federal licensing requirement. The trial judge instructed that a erson acts """"willfully"""" if he acts with the bad urose to disobey or disregard the law, but that he need not be aware of the secific law that his conduct may be violating. A jury found Bryan guilty. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that the instruction was roer and that the Government had shown that Bryan had acted willfully."

In 1987, James Jackson, as Acme's resident, signed a rogram articiation agreement with the Deartment of Education that authorized the school to receive student loan checks through the Title IV Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) rogram. Under the GSL rogram, governing regulations required Acme to return a ortion of a loan if the student withdrew from Acme before the term ended. In 1987, Jackson and Bates began a ractice of not making GSL refunds. Ultimately, in 1994, Bates was indicted on of """"knowingly and willfully misalying"""" federally insured student loan funds, in violation of 20 USC section 1097(a). The District Court dismissed Bates's indictment because it lacked an allegation of his """"intent to injure or defraud the United States."""" Reinstating the rosecution, the Court of Aeals concluded that section 1097(a) required the Government to rove only that Bates knowingly and willfully misalied Title IV funds."
"After Eugene Woodard's death sentence was finalized, the Ohio Adult Parole Authority commenced a clemency investigation. The Authority informed Woodard of his voluntary interview and clemency hearing. Ultimately, Woodard filed suit, alleging that Ohio's clemency rocess violated his Fourteenth Amendment due rocess right and his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals held that Woodard had failed to establish a life or liberty interest rotected by due rocess arising out of the clemency roceeding itself. The aellate court, however, also held that Woodard's retrial life and liberty interests were rotected because a minimal amount of due rocess attached to clemency due to its distance from trial. Subsequently, the Court of Aeals remanded the case for a determination as to what that rocess should be."
"Ramon Martinez-Villareal was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in Arizona. His first three federal habeas corus etitions were denied because he had not exhausted his state remedies. Martinez-Villareal claimed in his fourth habeas etition that he was incometent to be executed. The District Court dismissed that claim as remature, but granted the writ on other grounds. The Court of Aeals reversed the writ. Martinez-Villareal moved to reoen his etition desite the fact that review of his incometency claim might be revented by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). Under AEDPA, a risoner must ask the Court of Aeals to direct the District Court to consider such a etition. By now Arizona had obtained a warrant for Martinez-Villareal's execution. Subsequently, he was found fit to be executed. The District Court denied another motion to reoen his incometency claim, holding that it lacked jurisdiction under AEDPA. On aeal, the Court of Aeals held that the law did not aly to a etition that raises only a cometency-to-be-executed claim and that Martinez-Villareal did not, therefore, need authorization to file his etition in the District Court."
"Pursuant to the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA), the United States Forest Service develoed a Land and Resource Management Plan for Ohio's Wayne National Forest. The Plan sets logging goals, selects the areas suited to timber roduction, and determines which robable methods of timber harvest are aroriate, but it does not itself authorize the cutting of any trees. Ultimately, the Sierra Club filed suit, alleging that erroneous analysis leads the Plan wrongly to favor logging and clearcutting. The District Court granted the Forest Service summary judgment, finding that the Forest Service had acted lawfully in making the various challenged determinations. In reversing, the Court of Aeals, finding both that the Sierra Club had standing to bring suit, and that since the suit was """"rie for review,"""" there was no need to wait """"until a site-secific action occurs,"""" held that the Plan imroerly favored clearcutting and therefore violated the NFMA."
"In 1990, Randy G. Sencer began serving concurrent three-year sentences for convictions of felony stealing and burglary. In 1992, Sencer was released, but later that year his arole was revoked and he was returned to rison. Seeking to invalidate his arole revocation, Sencer filed unsuccessful habeas etitions in state court. Sencer then filed a federal habeas etition, alleging that he had not received due rocess in the arole revocation roceedings. In 1993, Sencer was re-released on arole before the District Court addressed the merits of his habeas etition. Subsequently, the court dismissed Sencer's etition as moot. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1988, a Florida statutory rovision exemted newsaers, but not magazines, from sales tax. In 1990, the Florida Sureme Court found the classification invalid under the First Amendment. Subsequently, Newsweek, a magazine, filed a claim for a refund of the sales tax that it had aid between 1988 and 1990. The Florida Deartment of Revenue denied the refund. Newsweek then filed suit alleging that Florida's failure to accord the magazine retroactive relief was a violation of due rocess. Ultimately, the District Court of Aeal of Florida, First District, concluded Newsweek was afforded due rocess because Florida law ermits reayment tax challenges by filing an action and aying the contested amount into the court registry, osting a bond, or obtaining a court order aroving an alternative arrangement, without suffering onerous enalties."
"This case consolidates two searate challenges to the constitutionality of two cancellations, made by President William J. Clinton, under the Line Item Veto Act (""""Act""""). In the first, the City of New York, two hosital associations, a hosital, and two health care unions, challenged the President's cancellation of a rovision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which relinquished the Federal Government's ability to recou nearly $2.6 billion in taxes levied against Medicaid roviders by the State of New York. In the second, the Snake River farmer's cooerative and one of its individual members challenged the President's cancellation of a rovision of the Taxayer Relief Act of 1997. The rovision ermitted some food refiners and rocessors to defer recognition of their caital gains in exchange for selling their stock to eligible farmers' cooeratives. After a district court held the Act unconstitutional, the Sureme Court granted certiorari on exedited aeal."
"Sandra K. Forney alied for Social Security disability benefits. A Social Security Judge determined Forney was minimally disabled, but that she was not disabled enough to qualify for benefits. Consequently she was denied her disability claim. The Social Security Administration's Aeals Council denied Forney's request for review. Forney then sought judicial review in federal District Court. The District Court found that the final determination was inadequately suorted by the evidence and remanded the case to the agency for further roceedings. Forney aealed the remand order to the Court of Aeals. She contended that the agency's denial of benefits should be reversed outright. The Court of Aeals did not hear her claim, however, for it decided that Forney did not have the legal right to aeal."
"At Vincent Edwards, Reynolds A. Wintersmith, Horace Joiner, Karl V. Fort, and Joseh Tidwell's trial for """"consiring"""" to """"ossess with intent to...distribute [mixtures containing two] controlled substances,"""" the jury was instructed that the Government must rove that the consiracy involved measurable amounts of """"cocaine or cocaine base (crack)."""" After the jury returned guilty verdicts, the District Judge imosed sentences based on his finding that each etitioners' illegal conduct involved both cocaine and crack. On aeal, the etitioners argued that their sentences were unlawful insofar as they were based uon crack, because the word """"or"""" in the jury instruction meant that the judge must assume that the consiracy involved only cocaine. The United States Sentencing Guidelines treats cocaine more leniently than crack. The Court of Aeals concluded that the Guidelines require the sentencing judge, not the jury, to determine both the kind and the amount of the drugs at issue in a drug consiracy."
"Hidalgo County agreed to take federal risoners into its custody in return for federal money. During this agreement, Brigido Marmolejo, the Sheriff of Hidalgo County, Texas, and Mario Salinas, his deuty, acceted money and two watches and a truck resectively, from Homero Beltran-Aguirr, a federal risoner housed in the county jail, in exchange for ermitting his girlfriend to visit him. Ultimately, Salinas was charged with one count of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act (RICO), 18 USC section 1962(c), one count of consiracy to violate RICO, section 1962(d), and two counts of bribery, section 666(a)(1)(B). The jury convicted him on all but the substantive RICO count. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Monroe, Georgia is covered by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which requires the reclearance of certain voting changes. Prior to 1966, the Monroe city charter did not secify whether a majority vote or a lurality vote was needed to win a mayoral election. In ractice, the city changed in 1966 from using a lurality-voting requirement to using a majority-voting requirement. The United States brought suit against the city, claiming that it had not sought reclearance of the change, as required by section 5 and sought to enjoin such majority voting and to require the city to return to lurality voting. The District Court, in granting summary judgment in favor of the United States, exressed the view that the change to majority voting had not been recleared in accordance with section 5."
"The Federal Election Camaign Act of 1971 (FECA) imoses recordkeeing and disclosure requirements uon olitical committees which receive more than $1,000 in """"contributions"""" or which make more than $1,000 in """"exenditures"""" in a year """"for the urose of influencing any election for Federal office.""""

A comlaint filed by a grou of voters asked the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to order the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) to make ublic the information that FECA demands of olitical committees. Ultimately, the FEC found that AIPAC was not a olitical committee because its major urose was not the nomination or election of candidates. The en banc Court of Aeals concluded that the FEC's major urose test imroerly interreted FECA's definition of a olitical committee."
"In 1983, a artnershi mortgaged its interest in the Louisiana equivalent of a leasehold estate on a arcel of real roerty in New Orleans to Regions Bank of Louisiana. The artnershi then granted a second mortgage to Mary Anna Rivet, Minna Ree Winer, Edmond G. Miranne, and Edmond G. Miranne, Jr. Later, the artnershi filed for bankrutcy. The Bankrutcy Court aroved the sale of the estate to the Bank, which sold the roerty. Rivet filed suit in Louisiana state court, alleging that the transfer of the roerty without satisfying their rights under the second mortgage violated state law. The Bank removed the action to federal court, contending that federal-question jurisdiction existed because the rior Bankrutcy Court orders extinguished Rivet's rights. Denying Rivet's motion to remand, the District Court granted the Bank summary judgment. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that removal is roer where a laintiff's state cause of action is comletely recluded by a rior federal judgment on a federal question."
"18 USC section 922(g)(1) forbids a erson convicted of a serious offense to ossess any firearm. Section 924(e) requires that a three-time violent felon who violates section 922(g)(1) receive an enhanced sentence. Section 921(a)(20) rovides that a revious conviction is not a redicate for the substantive offense or the enhanced sentence if the offender's civil rights have been restored, """"unless such... restoration... exressly rovides that the erson may not... ossess... firearms."""" In 1993, Gerald Caron was convicted of ossessing six rifles and shotguns in violation of section 922(g). The District Court enhanced Caron's sentence based, in art, on three Massachusetts convictions. In vacating his sentence, the Court of Aeals concluded that a Massachusetts law that ermitted Caron to ossess rifles, but not handguns, had restored his civil rights. On remand, the District Court found that, because Massachusetts law allowed Caron to ossess rifles, section 921(a)(20)'s """"unless clause"""" was not activated. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"Randall Ricci owns Rudeway Enterrises, a telemarketing business. After the Arlington Heights olice deartment determined that Ricci lacked the required business license and that one of Ricci's emloyees had an outstanding warrant, officers went to Rudeway Enterrises to arrest the emloyee. While arresting the emloyee, the officers also searched Ricci's business aers without a warrant. Subsequently, Ricci was arrested for violating Section 9-201 of the Village of Arlington Heights Code of Ordinances, which makes it unlawful to oerate a business without a license. Ultimately, Ricci filed a claim that the officers violated his civil rights by subjecting him to a full custodial arrest for committing a fine-only offense. The District Court dismissed the claim. Finding the arrest reasonable for Fourth Amendment uroses, the Court of Aeals rejected Ricci's argument that a full custodial arrest for violation of a fine-only ordinance is constitutionally ermissible only if the violation involves a breach of the eace."
"In 1983, Korean Air Lines (KAL) Flight KE007, en route from Alaska to South Korea entered the airsace of the former Soviet Union and was shot down. All 269 eole on board were killed. Reresentatives of three of the assengers (etitioners) sued KAL for damages for their decedents' re-death ain and suffering. While their suit was ending, the U.S. Sureme Court decided Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co. In Zicherman, the Court held that the Warsaw Convention ermits comensation only for legally cognizable harm and that the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) sulies the alicable U.S. law where an airlane crashes on the high seas. DOHSA allows certain relatives of a decedent to sue for their own ecuniary losses, but does not authorize recovery for the decedent's re-death ain and suffering. Subsequently, the District Court granted KAL's motion to dismiss etitioners' nonecuniary damages claims on the ground that DOHSA does not ermit recovery for such damages. In affirming, the Court of Aeals rejected the argument that general maritime law rovides a survival action for ain and suffering damages."
"In 1989, following the Chicago Landmarks Commission's reliminary determination that two of the International College of Surgeons and the United States Section of the International College of Surgeons' (ICS) buildings qualified for rotection under the city's Landmarks Ordinance, the city enacted a Designation Ordinance creating a landmark district that included the buildings. After ICS alied for and was denied a ermit to demolish all but the facades of the buildings, it sought judicial review of the Commission's decisions, alleging the ordinances and the manner in which the Commission conducted its roceedings violated the Federal and State Constitutions. Chicago removed the case to federal district court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals reversed the District Court's decision in favor of the city, ruling that a federal district court lacks jurisdiction of a case containing state law claims for on-the-record review of local administrative action."
"David and Linda Beach refinanced their Florida house in 1986 with a loan from Great Western Bank. In 1991, they stoed making mortgage ayments. In 1992, Great Western began foreclosure roceedings. While the Beach's acknowledged their default, they alleged that the bank's failure to make disclosures required by the Truth in Lending Act gave them the right under federal law to rescind the mortgage agreement. The Florida trial court rejected that defense, holding that any right to rescind had exired in 1989 under federal law which rovides that the right of rescission shall exire three years after the loan closes. The state's intermediate aellate court affirmed, as did the Florida Sureme Court."
"In 1992, Angel Francisco Breard, a citizen of Paraguay, was convicted of the attemted rae and caital murder of Ruth Dickie. Breard was scheduled to be executed by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1996. Ultimately, Breard filed a motion for habeas relief in Federal District Court, alleging that arresting authorities violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations when they failed to inform him that, as a foreign national, he had the right to contact the Paraguayan Consulate. The court concluded that Breard had rocedurally default this claim by failing to raise it in state court. The Court of Aeals affirmed. In 1996, Paraguayan officials brought suit alleging that Virginia officials had violated their rights under the Vienna Convention by failing to inform Breard of his treaty rights and the Paraguayan consulate of Breard's situation. Ultimately, the District Court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Randolh K. Reeves was charged with two counts of felony murder for the sexual assault and murder of Janet Mesner and Victoria Lamm, both of Lincoln, Nebraska. Under Nebraska law, felony murder is a form of first-degree murder committed in the eretration of certain felonies, including sexual assault. A conviction for felony murder renders a defendant eligible for the death enalty; however the jury does not charge the defendant because caital sentencing is a judicial function. In his trial Reeves requested the jury be given other otions rather than just felony murder. The trial court judge denied Reeves's motion and he was subsequently convicted on both counts. A three-judge anel sentenced Reeves to death. The Nebraska Sureme Court affirmed his convictions and sentences. After exhausting his state remedies, Reeves filed a federal habeas corus etition that the trial court's failure to give the requested instructions was unconstitutional. The District Court granted relief on an unrelated due rocess claim. The Court of Aeals rejected the lower court's decision, but held that a constitutional error had occurred."
"In 1992, Robert Joiner, after being diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer, sued General Electric Co. in Georgia state court, alleging that his disease was romoted by worklace exosure to chemical """"PCBs"""" and their derivatives, including olychlorinated dibenzofurans (furans) and olychlorinated dibenzodioxins (dioxins). Ultimately, Joiner rovided the District Court with exert witnesses' deositions that testified that PCBs, furans, and dioxins can romote cancer and that this was the likely cause of his cancer. The court granted GE summary judgment, reasoning that there was no genuine issue as to whether Joiner had been exosed to furans and dioxins and that his exerts' testimony had failed to show that there was a link between exosure to PCBs and small-cell lung cancer. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that the District Court erred in excluding the testimony of Joiner's exert witnesses. The aellate court alied a stringent standard of review to reach its conclusion."
"While living on the federal Army base Fort Polk, Debra Faye Lewis was charged with the murder of her four year-old daughter. Under the federal Assimilative Crimes Act (ACA), which rovides that """"whoever within... any [federal enclave], is guilty of any act or omission which, although not made unishable by any enactment of Congress, would be unishable... within the jurisdiction of the State... in which such lace is situated, ...shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to like unishment,"""" Lewis' indictment charged a violation of Louisiana's first-degree murder statute. Lewis was convicted and sentenced to life imrisonment without arole by the District Court. On aeal, the Court of Aeals reasoned that the ACA did not aly because Congress made Lewis' acts unishable as federal second-degree murder. The aellate court, however, affirmed Lewis' conviction because the jury had necessarily found all of the requisite elements of federal second-degree murder."
"An indictment returned in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri charged Vickie S. Cabrales with various charges of money laundering. The incident alleged that Cabrales deosited $40,000 with the AmSouth Bank of Florida, of which she later withdrew $38,000. The money was traceable to illegal cocaine sales in Missouri. Cabrales moved to dismiss the indictment for imroer venue. Because the money-laundering activity occurred entirely in Florida, the court dismissed two of the three counts against Cabrales. In affirming, the Court of Aeals noted that Article III, the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 18 required that a erson be tried where the charged offense was committed. The court also noted that laundering alleged in the indictment occurred entirely in Florida and that the Government did not assert that Cabrales transorted the money from Missouri to Florida."
"In 1996, Keith Schacht filed a state-court suit against the Wisconsin Deartment of Corrections and several of its emloyees (defendants), in their """"ersonal"""" and in their """"official"""" caacity, alleging that his dismissal violated the Federal Constitution and federal civil rights laws. After removing the case to federal court, the defendants asserted that the Eleventh Amendment doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the claims against the Deartment and its emloyees in their official caacity. The District Court granted the individual defendants summary judgment on the """"ersonal caacity"""" claims and dismissed the claims against the Deartment and the individual defendants in their """"official caacity."""" On aeal, the Court of Aeals concluded that the removal had been imroer because the resence of even one claim subject to an Eleventh Amendment bar derives the federal courts of removal jurisdiction over the entire case."
"Chater 154 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) rovides an exedited review rocess for federal habeas roceedings in caital cases in States that meet certain conditions. California officials stated that they believed they qualified for Chater 154. Troy Ashmus, a state risoner sentenced to death, filed a class action suit, which included all caital risoners in California whose convictions were affirmed on direct aeal after June 6, 1989, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to resolve uncertainty over whether Chater 154 alied. Holding that California did not qualify for Chater 154, the District Court enjoined the State from invoking the Chater in any roceedings involving class members. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the suit and that the injunction did not violate the First Amendment."
"Alida Star Gebser, a high school student in the Lago Vista Indeendent School District (""""Lago Vista""""), had a secret sexual affair with one of her teachers. At the time, Lago Vista had no official rocedure for reorting sexual harassment nor any formal anti-harassment olicy, as required by federal law. One day, after the two were discovered having sex, the teacher was arrested and fired. Claiming she was harassed in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (the """"Amendments""""), roviding that no erson """"be subjected to discrimination"""" under any federally funded education rogram or activity, Gebser sought damages against Lago Vista. On aeal from a decision affirming a district court's ruling in favor of Lago Vista, the Sureme Court granted Gebser certiorari."
"Following Douglas Buchanan's conviction for the caital murders of his father, stemother, and two brothers, the rosecutor sought the death enalty based on Virginia's aggravating factor that the crime was vile. The trial court instructed the jury that if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that Buchanan's conduct was vile, """"then you may fix the unishment...at death,"""" but """"if you believe from all the evidence that...death...is not justified, then you shall fix the unishment...at life imrisonment."""" Buchanan sought four additional instructions on articular mitigating factors and a general instruction on the concet of mitigating evidence. The court denied Buchanan, refusing to single out certain mitigating factors to the sentencing jury. The jury returned with a verdict for the death enalty."
"Under the Medicare Act a hosital may obtain a reimbursement for certain graduate medical education (GME) rograms for interns and residents by rearing certain reorts. The GME Amendment, section 9202(a), of the Medicare and Medicaid Budget Reconciliation Amendments of 1985 directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine, for a hosital's cost reorting eriod starting during fiscal year 1984, the amount """"recognized as reasonable"""" for GME costs. The Amendment then directs the Secretary to use the 1984 amount, adjusted for inflation, to calculate a hosital's GME reimbursement for subsequent years. The Secretary's """"reaudit"""" regulation ermits a second audit of the 1984 GME costs to ensure accurate reimbursements in future years. A reaudit of Regions Hosital significantly lowered the Hosital's allowable 1984 GME costs. Subsequently, the Hosital challenged the validity of the reaudit rule. Ultimately, the District Court granted the Secretary summary judgment, concluding that the rule reasonably interreted Congress' rescrition and that the reauditing did not imose an imermissible """"retroactive rule."""" The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Richard Trest sought a writ of habeas corus that would cancel the sentence he was serving in Louisiana for armed robbery. The District Court rejected his claim. Trest aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit, but before hearing the facts of the case, the Court of Aeals denied his aeal as a """"rocedural default."""" The Court of Aeals ruled that Trent had failed to meet the deadline for filing his federal claims in state court. Though Louisiana had not raised the issue, the Fifth Circuit felt comelled to dismiss the case on its own initiative. Trest aealed to the Sureme Court, arguing that the Fifth Circuit had incorrectly believed that it was required to decide the """"rocedural default"""" issue sua sonte - that is, without romting from one of the arties."
"erry Cambell, a white man, was indicted for second-degree murder by a grand jury in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana. Cambell moved to quash the indictment by citing a long history of racial discrimination in the selection of grand jury foreersons in Evangeline Parish. No African-American had served as a foreerson for the ast 16 years desite the fact twenty ercent of the registered voters were black. Cambell claimed such ractices violated his Fourteenth Amendment equal rotection and due rocess rights. A Louisiana trial judge denied Cambell's challenge, holding that he lacked standing as a white man comlaining about the exclusion of African-Americans from serving as foreersons. The Louisiana Court of Aeal overruled the trial judge and decided Cambell had standing. The Louisiana Sureme Court reversed the Court of Aeal."
"John Hudson was chairman of the First National Bank of Titon and the First National Bank of Hammon. Hudson used his osition to regain bank stock he had used as collateral on defaulted loans through a series of bank loans to other arties. Uon investigation the Office of the Comtroller of Currency (OCC) found that the loans were made in violation of several banking statues and regulations. The OCC fined and debarred Hudson for the violations. Later, he faced criminal indictment in federal District Court for violations tied to those same events. Hudson objected, arguing that the indictment violated the Double Jeoardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.The U. S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit eventually found for the Government in light of emUnited States v. Halerem on the grounds that the original roceedings were civil in nature and not so disroortional to the roven damages to the Government as to qualify as a form of criminal unishment."
"Aloyzas Balsys was suboenaed by the Justice Deartment's Office of Secial Investigations (OSI) to testify about his wartime activities between 1940 and 1944 and his subsequent immigration to the United States. Fearing rosecution by a foreign nation, Balsys refused the suboena by claiming his Fifth Amendment rivilege against self-incrimination. On aeal from an aellate court's reversal of a district court ruling granting OSI's suboena enforcement etition, the Sureme Court granted the United States certiorari."
"The Extradition Act imlements the Constitution's extradition clause and rovides for the extradition from one state of a fugitive from justice when a demand for the fugitive's extradition is made by another state. Manuel Ortiz, a arolee from the Ohio correctional system, fled to New Mexico after Ohio rison officials told him that they lanned to revoke his arole status. The governor of New Mexico issued a warrant directing Ortiz's return uon Ohio's demand. Ortiz then sought habeas corus relief in New Mexico. Ultimately, the Sureme Court of New Mexico affirmed a grant of habeas corus relief. The court exressed the view that Ortiz was a refugee from injustice and that the New Mexico constitution, which guarantees the right of seeking and obtaining safety, revailed over the state's duty under the extradition clause."
"The U.S. holds in trust the Oklahoma land that the federally recognized Kiowa Tribe owns. In 1990, the then-Chairman of the Tribe's Business Committee signed a romissory note in the Tribe's name in order to urchase stock from Manufacturing Technologies, Inc. The note states that it was signed on tribal lands and rovides that nothing in it subjects or limits the Tribe's sovereign rights. After the Tribe defaulted, Manufacturing Technologies sued the Tribe in state court, claiming that the note was executed and delivered beyond tribal lands. The Tribe moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Denying the motion, the trial court entered judgment for Manufacturing Technologies. In affirming, the Oklahoma Court of Civil Aeals held that Indian tribes are subject to suit in state court for breaches of contract involving off-reservation commercial conduct."
"New York Tax Law section 631(b)(6) denies only nonresident taxayers a state income tax deduction for alimony aid. In 1990, Christoher Lunding and his wife, residents of Connecticut, were required to ay higher taxes on their New York income when the State denied their attemted deduction of a ro rata ortion of the alimony Lunding aid a revious souse. Lunding commenced suit, asserting that section 631(b)(6) discriminates against New York nonresidents in violation of the Privileges and Immunities, Equal Protection, and Commerce Clauses of the Federal Constitution. Ultimately, the New York Court of Aeals held that section 631(b)(6) was adequately justified because New York residents who are subject to taxation on all of their income regardless of source should be entitled to the benefit of full deduction of exenses, while ersonal exenses of a nonresident taxayer are more aroriately allocated to the State of residence."
"The National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act entrusts the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) with discretion to award financial grants to the arts. The NEA's broad decision guidelines are: """"artistic and cultural significance,"""" with emhasis on """"creativity and cultural diversity rofessional excellence,"""" and the encouragement of """"ublic education and areciation of the arts."""" In 1990, Congress amended the criteria by requiring the NEA to consider """"artistic excellence and artistic merit taking into consideration general standards of decency and resect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American ublic."""" After suffering a funding rejection, Karen Finely, along with three other erformance artists and the National Association of Artists' Organizations, challenged the NEA's amended statutory review roceedings as unconstitutionally vague and discriminatory. After consecutive district and aellate court rulings in favor of Finley, the Sureme Court granted the NEA certiorari."
"In 1995, the Texas Legislature enacted Chater 39. Chater 39 holds local school boards accountable to the State for student achievement in the ublic schools. The State Commissioner of Education may select from various sanctions, including the aointment of a master or a management team and the contracting out of services, when a school district falls short of Chater 39's accreditation criteria. Under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Texas submitted Chater 39 to the United States Attorney General for a determination whether any of the sanctions effected voting and thus required reclearance. Ultimately, the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights cautioned that such sanctions imlementation might violate section 5. Subsequently, Texas sought a declaration District Court that section 5 did not aly to such sanctions. The court concluded that Texas's claim was not rie."
"Both a judgment lien and federal tax liens encumbered the real roerty of Francis Romani's Pennsylvania estate, worth $53,001, following his death. The estate's administrator sought a county court's ermission to transfer the roerty to the judgment creditor. The Government objected to the conveyance, arguing that 31 USC section 3713(a), which rovides that a Government claim """"shall be aid first"""" when a decedent's estate cannot ay all of its debts, rioritized its ayment. Nevertheless, the court authorized the conveyance. Ultimately, the Pennsylvania Sureme Court affirmed. The court concluded that Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 modified the Government's reference and recognized the riority of many state claims over federal tax liens."
"Section 109 of the Federal Credit Union Act rovides that that """"federal credit union membershi shall be limited to grous having a common bond of occuation or association, or to grous within a well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district."""" The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) interrets section 9 to ermit federal credit unions to be comosed of multile, unrelated emloyer grous, each having its own distinct common bond of occuation. Under this interretation, the NCUA aroved a series of charter amendments adding several unrelated emloyer grous to the membershi of AT&am;T Family Federal Credit Union, which now has aroximately 110,000 members nationwide only 35% of whom are emloyees of AT&am;T and its affiliates. Subsequently, a number of rivate actors brought suit under the Administrative Procedure Act, asserting that the NCUA's decision was contrary to law because section 109 unambiguously requires that the same common bond of occuation unite each member of an occuationally defined federal credit union and members of the new grous did not share a common bond of occuation with AT&am;T Family Federal Credit Union's existing members. Ultimately, the District Court held that the rivate interests lack standing to challenge NCUA's decision and the Court of Aeals reversed."
"In 1983, Margaret Kawaauhau sought treatment from Dr. Paul Geiger for a foot injury. Later, Geiger cancelled Kawaauhau's transfer, by other hysicians, to an infectious disease secialist. Ultimately, Kawaauhau required that her right leg be amutated below the knee. In the subsequently malractice suit, a jury awarded Kawaauhau aroximately $355,000 in damages. Geiger, who carried no malractice insurance, ultimately filed for bankrutcy. Kawaauhau requested the Bankrutcy Court to hold the malractice judgment nondischargeable under 11 USC section 523(a)(6), which rovides that a """"discharge [in bankrutcy]... does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt... for willful and malicious injury... to another."""" The court held the debt nondischargeable. The District Court affirmed. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that section 523(a)(6)'s exemtion from discharge is confined to debts for an intentional tort, so that a debt for malractice remains dischargeable because it is based on negligent or reckless conduct."
"During a routine check of dearting international flight assengers, customs officers discovered $357,144 on the erson of Hose Bajakajian. In addition to charging him, under 31 U.S.C. Section 5316, of attemting to leave the United States with an unreorted sum in excess of $10,000 cash, the government also sought forfeiture of the entire $357,144 under 18 U.S.C. Section 982 roviding that the deliberate violation of Section 5316 shall result in the forfeiture of """"any roerty involved in such an offense."""" After having its forfeiture claim rejected in both a district court and the Ninth Circuit, as excessively unconstitutional, the Sureme Court granted the government certiorari."
"After the local rent control administrator ordered Edward S. Cohen to refund $31,382.50 in excessive rents he had charged Hilda de la Cruz and other tenants, Cohen sought to discharge his debts under Chater 7 of the Bankrutcy Code. The tenants filed an adversary roceeding, arguing that the debt Cohen owed to them was nondischargeable under ?523(a)(2)(A) of the Code, which excets from discharge """"any debt ... for money, roerty, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to the extent obtained by ... actual fraud."""" The tenants also sought treble damages, attorney's fees, and costs under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. The Bankrutcy Court ruled in their favor, finding that Cohen had committed """"actual fraud"""" within the meaning of ?523(a)(2)(A) of the Code and that his conduct violated the New Jersey law. The court, therefore, awarded the tenants treble damages totaling $94,147.50, lus attorney's fees and costs. The District Court affirmed, as did the Court of Aeals, which held that debts resulting from fraud are nondischargeable under ?523(a)(2)(A) of the Code, and that the award of treble damages (lus attorney's fees and costs) in this case was therefore nondischargeable."
"The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), a rivate-sector labor organization, reresents ilots emloyed by Delta Air Lines. The collective-bargaining agreement between ALPA and Delta includes an """"agency sho"""" clause that requires nonunion Delta ilots to ay ALPA a monthly service charge for reresenting them. 153 Delta ilots challenged in federal-court action the manner in which ALPA calculated agency fees. Under ALPA olicy ilots who object to the fee calculation may request arbitration roceedings. When 174 Delta ilots filed objections to the agency-fee calculation, the ALPA treated the objections as requests for arbitration. The arbitrator sustained ALPA's calculation. The District Court concluded that the ilots seeking to challenge the fee calculation must exhaust arbitral remedies before roceeding in court. The Court of Aeals reversed the District Court. It found no legal basis for requiring objectors to arbitrate agency-fee challenges when they had not agreed to do so."
"Under an 1834 comact between New York and New Jersey, Ellis Island was deemed art of New York. It was later determined, by the Sureme Court, that New Jersey would have sovereign rights over all submerged lands on its side of the Hudson River. During the time Ellis Island was used to receive immigrants, the Federal Government filled around the island adding some 24.5 acres to its original size over 42 years. When immigration was diverted from Ellis Island in 1954, New York and New Jersey asserted rival sovereignty claims over the Island's filled ortions. New Jersey finally invoked the Sureme Court's original jurisdiction to solve the matter once and for all time."
"The site of a chemical manufacturing lant was olluted over many years. During much of the time, the comanies running the lant were wholly owned subsidiaries of, first, CPC International Inc. (CPC), and later Aerojet- General Cor (Aerojet). By 1981, the federal Environmental Protection Agency had undertaken to have the site cleaned u. To recover some of the money sent, the U.S. filed an action under Section 107 of the Comrehensive Environmental Resonse, Comensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. Section 9607(a)(2). Section 107 allows the U.S. to seek reimbursement for cleanu costs from, among others, """"any erson who at the time of disosal of any hazardous substance owned or oerated any facility."""" The first hase of the trial concerned only liability, and focused on whether CPC and Aerojet had """"owned or oerated"""" the facility."
"When questioned by federal agents as to the receit of gifts or money from a comany whose emloyees were members of the union in which he was an officer, James Brogan falsely answered """"no."""" Brogan was subsequently indicted on federal bribery charges and the making of false statements within a federal agency's jurisdiction. Brogan challenged his conviction, arguing that false statements which merely deny wrongdoing, and do not imede federal functions, are rotected under the Fifth Amendment. On aeal from an aeals court judgment uholding an adverse district court ruling, the Sureme Court granted Brogan certiorari."
"8 USC section 1326(a) makes it a crime, unishable by u to two years in rison, for a deorted alien to return to the United States without secial ermission. In 1998, Congress added subsection (b)(2), which authorizes a maximum rison term of 20 years for """"any alien described"""" in subsection (a), if the initial """"deortation was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony."""" In 1995, Hugo Almendarez-Torres leaded guilty to violating section 1326. Ultimately, the District Court sentenced Almendarez- Torres to 85 months' imrisonment. The court rejected his argument that, because his indictment failed to mention his aggravated felony convictions, the court could not sentence him to more than the maximum sentence authorized by section 1326(a). In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that subsection (b)(2) is a enalty rovision which ermits the imosition of a higher sentence when the unlawfully returning alien also has a record of rior convictions."

Hooker,"""" to three television stations owned by C. Elvin Feltner after the stations' royalty ayments became delinquent. Columbia sued Feltner after his stations continued to broadcast the rograms for coyright infringement. After winning artial summary judgment as to liability on its coyright infringement claims, Columbia attemted to recover statutory damages under section 504(c) of the Coyright Act. The District Court denied Feltner's request for a jury trial and awarded Columbia statutory damages following a bench trial. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that neither section 504(c) nor the Seventh Amendment rovides a right to a jury trial on statutory damages."
"Janet Scott-Harris filed suit under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 against the city of Fall River, Massachusetts, the city's mayor, Daniel Bogan, the vice resident of the city counsel, Marilyn Roderick, and others, alleging that the elimination of the city deartment in which Scott-Harris was the sole emloyee was motivated by a desire to retaliate against her for exercising her First Amendment rights. The jury found the city, Bogan and Roderick liable on the First Amendment claim. The First Circuit set aside the verdict against the city, but affirmed the judgments against Bogan and Roderick. The court held that although Bogan and Roderick had absolute immunity from civil liability for their erformance of legitimate legislative activities, their conduct in voting for and signing the ordinance that eliminated Scott-Harris's office was motivated by considerations relating to a articular individual and was therefore administrative rather than legislative in nature."
"The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) amended the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to ermit a beneficiary of an emloyer's grou health lan to elect continuing coverage when he might otherwise lose that benefit because of a """"qualifying event,"""" such as the termination of emloyment. In 1993, when Moore Medical Cororation fired James Geissal, it told him that COBRA gave him the right to elect continuing coverage under Moore's health lan. Later, Moore informed Geissal that he was not entitled to COBRA benefits because he was already covered by a grou lan through his wife's emloyer. Geissal then filed suit against Moore, alleging that Moore was violating CORBA by renouncing an obligation to rovide continuing coverage. Ultimately, a Magistrate Judge concluded that an emloyee with coverage under another grou health lan on the date he elects COBRA coverage is ineligible for COBRA coverage under 29 USC section 1162(2)(D)(i), which allows an emloyer to cancel such coverage as of """"the date on which the qualified beneficiary first becomes, after the date of the election... covered under any other grou health lan."""" The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The Internal Revenue Code allowed roerty and casualty insurers to fully deduct """"loss reserves,"""" or unaid losses. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 altered the deduction formula. Under the Act, increases in loss reserves that constitute """"reserve strengthening,"""" or additions to the loss reserve, were exceted from a one time tax benefit because it would result in a tax deficiency. Treasury regulation and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue interreted the law to say that any increase in loss reserves constituted reserve strengthening. The Commissioner then determined Atlantic Mutual Insurance Comany had engaged in reserve strengthening. The Tax Court disagreed with the government's interretation. It held reserve strengthening referred only to increases resulting from comutational methods. The Court of Aeals reversed the decision. It held reserve strengthening to encomass any increase in loss reserves."
"In 1980, Wayne K. Pfaff develoed a new tye of comuter chi socket for Texas Instruments (TI). In early Aril 1981, TI confirmed they would order and use Pfaff's socket. No actual socket was made until July 1981. Pfaff alied for a atent in Aril 1982. A atent was not granted on Pfaff's socket until 1985. After the atent was issued, Pfaff sued Wells Electronics, who had develoed a cometing socket, for atent infringement. Pfaff claimed that Wells' socket infringed uon six of his atent's claims. The District Court held that Wells' socket violated three of Pfaff's atent claims. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held Pfaff had sold the socket to TI more than a year before he alied for a atent. Thus, Wells' socket did not infringe on Pfaff's under the Patent Act of 1952, which states that no one can atent an invention that has been on sale for more than one year before filing a atent alication."
"After Darren Boerckel's state convictions of rae, burglary, and aggravated battery were affirmed by the Illinois Aellate Court and the Illinois Sureme Court denied his etition for leave to aeal, he filed a federal habeas corus etition. The etition asked for relief on six grounds: (1) that Boerckel had not knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights; (2) that his confession was not voluntary; (3) that the evidence against him was insufficient to sustain the conviction; (4) that his confession was the fruit of an illegal arrest; (5) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on aeal; and (6) that his right to discovery of exculatory material was violated. In denying the etition, the District Court found that Boerckel had rocedurally defaulted his first three claims by failing to include them in his etition to the Illinois Sureme Court. In reversing and remanding, the Court of Aeals concluding that Boerckel had not rocedurally defaulted those claims because he was not required to resent them in a etition for discretionary review to the Illinois Sureme Court in order to satisfy 28 U. S. C. Sections 2254(b)(1), (c), the exhaustion requirement. Under the exhaustion requirement federal habeas relief is available to state risoners only after they have exhausted their claims in state court."
"Immediately after the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act (Act) changed atent laws to abrogate state's sovereign immunity, College Savings Bank (College) filed a atent infringement suit against Florida Preaid Postsecondary Education Exense Board (Florida Preaid), a Florida state entity. Florida Preaid asked that College's suit be dismissed and that the Act be declared unconstitutional, based on Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida (517 US 44) which uheld state sovereign immunity. The United States joined College looking to uhold the Act's constitutionality. After agreeing with College, the District Court denied Florida Preaid's dismissal motion. When the Federal Circuit affirmed, Florida Preaid aealed and the Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"Stanley I. Jacobson and other retired emloyees of Hughes Aircraft Comany were beneficiaries of Hughes Non-Bargaining Retirement Plan. Jacobson and the others claimed in their class-action lawsuit that Hughes violated the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the federal ension rotection law, when it amended the lan twice in resonse to a $1.2 billion dollar surlus. ERISA requires that some of the surlus be distributed to cover emloyees when a ension lan is terminated. Hughes' first amendment to the lan established an early retirement rogram that rovided significant additional retirement benefits to certain eligible active emloyees. The second amendment disallowed new articiants from contributing to the lan. Jacobson and others argued that Hughes had terminated one lan and started another by stoing its ension lan contributions. Thus, the comany had used the lan's surlus to benefit new emloyees at the exense of the retirees. The District Court dismissed the comlaint for failure to state a claim. The Court of Aeals reversed the District Court by finding that the early retirement rogram and noncontributory benefit structure were rohibited by the ERISA."
"Over several years, the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs contracted with Blaze Construction Comany to build, reair, and imrove roads on several Indian reservations located in Arizona. When the various contracts exired, the Arizona Deartment of Revenue issued a tax deficiency assessment against Blaze for its failure to ay Arizona's transaction rivilege tax, the tax levied on the gross receits of comanies doing business in the state, on the roceeds from its contracts with the Bureau. Blaze rotested the assessment and revailed in administrative roceedings. On review, the Arizona Tax Court granted summary judgment for the Deartment. In reversing, the Arizona Court of Aeals held that federal law re-emted the tax's alication to Blaze. The Sureme Court of Arizona denied review."
"Two U.S. District Judges, William M. Acker, Jr., and U. W. Clemon, who maintain their rincial offices in Jefferson County, Alabama, resisted ayment of a state-aroved, county-authorized occuational tax on the ground that it violates the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. The county instituted collection suits in Alabama small claims court against the judges, who removed the suits to the Federal District Court under the federal officer removal statute. The federal court denied the county's motions to remand and granted summary judgment for the judges, holding the county tax unconstitutional under the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine to the extent that it reached federal judges' comensation. The en banc Court of Aeals affirmed. The U.S. Sureme Court granted Jefferson County's initial etition for certiorari and remanded for further consideration of whether the Tax Injunction Act derived the District Court of jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter. On remand, the Court of Aeals adhered to its rior en banc decision. Certiorari was granted again to consider whether the removal from state court to federal court was unauthorized by the federal officer removal statute, the Tax Injunction Act issue, and the merits of the case."
"The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States rovides imorters a artial exemtion from duties otherwise imosed for articles which were assembled abroad, but that were not enhanced abroad, excet by oerations incidental to the assembly rocess. A regulation issued by the United States Customs Service deems ermaressing oerations to be an additional ste in manufacture, not art of or incidental to the assembly rocess. The Haggar Aarel Comany sought a refund for duties imosed on a collection of its men's trousers that it had shied to the U.S. from an assembly lant in Mexico. The trousers' re-treated fabric had been cut in the U.S. and then shied to Mexico, along with the thread, buttons, and ziers necessary to comlete the garments. Under the HTSUS, had the trousers only been sewn and reshied they would have been eligible for the duty exemtion that Haggar sought. However, Haggar also ermaressed the trousers by baking them in an oven at the Mexican facility before shiing them to the U.S. The Customs Service claimed that the baking was a rocess in addition to assembly and denied the duty exemtion. Haggar contended that the baking was simly art of the assembly rocess. Subsequently, Haggar filed suit, seeking the refund, in the Court of International Trade. The court declined to treat the Customs Service's regulation as controlling and ruled in Haggar's favor. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"James T. Goldsmith, an Air Force major, defied an order from a suerior officer to inform his sex artners that he was infected with HIV and to take measures to block any transfer of bodily fluids during sexual intercourse. Goldsmith was convicted by general court-martial under several counts and sentenced to six years' confinement and artial forfeiture of salary. The Air Force Court of Criminal Aeals affirmed. Goldsmith sought no review of the decision in the Court of Aeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) and his conviction became final. Subsequently, the Air Force notified Goldsmith that it was taking action to dro him from the rolls under a newly enacted statute. Goldsmith then etitioned the Air Force Court of Criminal Aeals for extraordinary relief under the All Writs Act, which authorizes courts established by Congress to """"issue all writs necessary and aroriate in aid of their resective jurisdictions,"""" to redress the unrelated alleged interrution of his HIV medication during his incarceration, but did not immediately contest his removal from the Air Force rolls. The Air Force Court of Criminal Aeals ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to act. On aeal to the CAAF from this determination, Goldsmith first asserted the claim that the Air Force's action to dro him violated the Ex Post Facto and Double Jeoardy Clauses of the Constitution. He argued that the statute had been enacted after the date of his court-martial conviction and that the action would inflict successive unishment based on the same conduct underlying his first conviction. The CAAF granted his etition for extraordinary relief to redress the interrution of his HIV medication and relied on the All Writs Act in enjoining the President and other officials from droing Goldsmith from the Air Force rolls."
"The 1996 Telecommunications Act (Act) fundamentally altered local telehone markets by ending the monoolies traditionally given to local exchange carriers (LECs) by states and subjecting LECs to a host of duties meant to facilitate market entry. Among these was the imosition of an obligation on incumbent LECs to share their networks with cometitors. Following the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) issuance of regulations imlementing the Act's guidelines, AT&am;T challenged their constitutionality on behalf of itself and other existing hone service roviders."
"Acting on a ti from a confidential informant and a subsequent investigation, sheriff's deuties stoed and searched Kevin Dyson's automobile. The deuties found 23 grams of crack cocaine in a duffel bag in the trunk. Dyson was convicted of consiracy to ossess cocaine with intent to distribute. In reversing, the Maryland Court of Secial Aeals held that in order for the automobile excetion to the warrant requirement under the Fourth Amendment to aly, there must be not only robable cause to believe that evidence of a crime is contained in the automobile, but also a searate finding of an exigency which recluded the olice from obtaining a warrant. Although there was abundant robable cause, the court concluded that the search violated the Fourth Amendment because there was no exigency that revented or even made it significantly difficult for the olice to obtain a search warrant."
"Wanda Johnson was run over by a truck in May 1992 and was rushed to the Humana Hosital-University of Louisville, Kentucky, now Galen of Virginia, Inc. After about six weeks at Galen, during which time Johnson's health remained in a volatile state, Galen's agents arranged for her transfer to the Crestview Health Care Facility in Indiana. Johnson was transferred to Crestview in July, and uon arrival her condition deteriorated significantly. Johnson was taken to the Midwest Medical Center where she remained for many months and incurred substantial medical exenses as a result of her deterioration. Jane Roberts, Johnson's guardian, then filed a federal action under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), alleging violations of Section 1395dd(b) of the Act. Section 1395dd of the Act laces obligations of screening and stabilization uon hositals and emergency rooms that receive atients suffering from an """"emergency medical condition."""" The District Court granted summary judgment for Galen on the ground that Roberts had failed to show that """"either the medical oinion that Johnson was stable or the decision to authorize her transfer was caused by an imroer motive."""" In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that in order to state a claim in an EMTALA suit alleging a violation of Section 1395dd(b)'s stabilization requirement, a laintiff must show that the hosital's inaroriate stabilization resulted from an imroer motive such as one involving the indigency, race, or sex of the atient."
"The California Dental Association (CDA), a nonrofit association of local dental societies, rovides its members with insurance and financing arrangements, and engages in lobbying, litigation, marketing, and ublic relations for members' benefit. Members agree to abide by the CDA's Code of Ethics, which rohibits false or misleading advertising. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought a comlaint against the CDA, alleging that the CDA's guidelines restricted two tyes of truthful, non-decetive advertising: rice advertising and advertising relating to the quality of dental services and therefore had violated section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) held that the FTC had jurisdiction over the CDA and found a violation of section 5 of the FTC Act. The FTC adoted most of the ALJ's factual findings and held that the rice advertising, as well as the non-rice, restrictions were violations of the Sherman and FTC Acts under an abbreviated rule-of-reason analysis. In affirming, the Court of Aeals sustain the FTC's jurisdiction and concluded that an abbreviated rule-of-reason analysis was roer in this case."
"Bashar Amer, Aiad Barakat, Julie Mungai, Amjad Obeid, Ayman Obeid, Naim Sharif, Khader Hamide, and Michel Shehadeh, members of the Poular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), were marked for deortation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The PFLP is characterized by the government as an international terrorist and communist organization. The resident aliens filed suit alleging the Attorney General and other federal arties had targeted them for deortation because of their affiliation with a olitically unoular grou, in violation of their First and Fifth Amendment rights. Initially, the District Court enjoined the deortation roceedings. During the case, Congress assed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Resonsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). The IIRIRA restricts judicial review of the Attorney General's """"decision or action"""" to """"commence roceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this Act."""" Reno then filed motions arguing that the IIRIRA derived the courts of jurisdiction over the aliens' selective-enforcement claim. The District Court denied the motion. The Court of Aeals affirmed the District Court's decision on the merits."
"Ceasar Wright worked as a longshoreman. He belonged to the International Longshoremen's Association, AFL-CIO, a union that sulied workers to the South Carolina Stevedores Association (SCSA). In 1992, Wright sustained a worked-related; he sought comensation for ermanent disability under federal law. In 1995, Wright returned to Longshoremen's Association to be referred for work. When the stevedoring comanies, to which he was referred, discovered that he had reviously settled a claim for ermanent disability, they informed the union they would not accet Wright for emloyment. Under the collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) between the Longshoremen's Association and the SCSA, Wright was not qualified to erform longshore work if he was ermanently disabled. Wright chose not to file a grievance under the CBA, but instead to file a claim under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). He alleged the stevedoring comanies and the SCSA had discriminated against him by refusing him work. The District Court dismissed the case because Wright had failed to ursue the grievance rocedure -- arbitration -- rovided by the CBA. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1995, Laura and Arlinda Neztsosie, and others, filed searate lawsuits in the Navajo Tribal Courts, claiming damages for injuries suffered as a result of El Paso Natural Gas Cororation's and Cyrus Foote Mineral Comany's uranium mining oerations. El Paso and Cyrus Foote, defendants in those suits, each filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking to enjoin the Neztsosies from ursuing their tribal court claims. The District Court denied reliminary injunctions excet to the extent that the Neztsosies sought relief in the Tribal Courts under the Price-Anderson Act. The Price-Anderson Act rovides certain federal licensees with limited liability for claims of """"ublic liability"""" arising out of or resulting from a nuclear incident, converts such actions into federal claims, grants federal district courts removal jurisdiction over such actions, and rovides the mechanics for consolidating the actions and for managing them once consolidated. The District Court left the determinations whether the Act alied to the Neztsosies' claims to the Tribal Courts. On El Paso's and Cyrus Foote's consolidated aeals, the Court of Aeals affirmed the District Court's decisions not to enjoin the Neztsosies from ursuing non-Price-Anderson Act claims and to allow the Tribal Courts to decide whether the Neztsosies' claims fell under that Act. Further, although the Neztsosies had not aealed the artial injunctions, the Court of Aeals moved on its own to reverse them."
"Alabama requires each cororation doing business in that state to ay a franchise tax based on the firm's caital. A domestic firm, organized under the laws of Alabama, has leeway in controlling its own tax base and tax liability. A foreign firm, organized under the laws of a State other than Alabama, does not have similar leeway to control its tax base. In 1986, the Reynolds Metals Comany and other foreign cororations sued Alabama's tax authorities, seeking a refund of the foreign franchise tax they had aid on the ground that the tax discriminated against foreign cororations in violation of the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses. The Alabama Sureme Court rejected Reynolds' claims, holding that the secial burden imosed on foreign cororations simly offset a different burden imosed exclusively on domestic cororations by Alabama's domestic shares tax. During the Reynolds case, the South Central Bell Telehone Comany and others brought a suit asserting similar Commerce and Equal Protection Clause claims. The Alabama trial court agreed with South Central Bell that the tax substantially discriminated against foreign cororations, but nonetheless dismissed their claims as barred by res judicata in light of the State Sureme Court's Reynolds decision. The Alabama Sureme Court affirmed."
"In 1993, a magistrate judge issued a warrant authorizing the search of Paul and Erma Berger's Montana ranch for evidence of the taking of wildlife in violation of federal law. Later, a multile-vehicle caravan consisting of government agents and a crew of hotograhers and reorters from CNN roceeded to the ranch. In executing the warrant, the federal officers allowed the media crew to accomany and observe them. Subsequently, the Berger's filed suit, asserting that the officials, secial agents of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and an assistant United States attorney, had violated their rights under the Fourth Amendment. The District Court concluded that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity, as no clearly established law rotecting individuals from the commercial recording of a search of their remises existed at the time. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"The Commonwealth of Virginia charged Tommy David Strickler with caital murder and related crimes. Strickler's counsel did not file a retrial motion for discovery of all ossible exculatory evidence under Brady v. Maryland because an oen file olicy gave him access to all of the evidence in the rosecutor's files. At Strickler's trial, Anne Stoltzfus gave detailed eyewitness testimony about the crimes and Strickler's role as one of the eretrators. The rosecutor failed to disclose exculatory materials in the olice files, consisting of notes taken by a detective during interviews with Stoltzfus, and letters written by Stoltzfus to the detective, that cast serious doubt on significant ortions of her testimony. The jury found Strickler guilty and he was sentenced to death. The Virginia Sureme Court affirmed. In subsequent state habeas corus roceedings, Strickler advanced an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on trial counsel's failure to file a motion for disclosure of all exculatory evidence known to the rosecution or in its ossession under Brady. In resonse, the Commonwealth asserted that such a motion was unnecessary because of the rosecutor's oen file olicy. The trial court denied relief and the Virginia Sureme Court affirmed. Strickler then filed a federal habeas corus etition and was granted access to the exculatory Stoltzfus materials. The District Court vacated Strickler's caital murder conviction and death sentence on the grounds that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose those materials and that he had not, in consequence, received a fair trial. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that Strickler had rocedurally defaulted his Brady claim by not raising it at his trial or in the state collateral roceedings. Ultimately, the court concluded that the claim was, in any event, without merit."
"Wayne Thomas Carter, Melvin Johns, and Kimberly Thomson were arrested after a olice officer observed them through a window bagging cocaine in Thomson's aartment. During the trial in Minnesota state court, the defendants moved to suress the cocaine as evidence. They argued the officer's initial observation was an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. Subsequently, they were all convicted on state drug charges. The Minnesota trial court held that because they were not overnight social guests they were not rotected by the Fourth Amendment. Moreover, the court held that the officer's window-based observation was not a search under the Fourth Amendment. On aeal, the state intermediate aellate court held Carter did not have standing for an objection to the officer's action because his use of the aartment for drug uroses removed any legitimate exectation of rivacy. The court also affirmed Johns' conviction . The Minnesota Sureme Court reversed. It held that the defendants had a legitimate exectation of rivacy in the invaded lace and that the officer's observation constituted an unreasonable search. Minnesota sought a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Sureme Court."
"Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., an investment fund, urchased aroximately $75 million in unsecured notes (Notes) from Gruo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A., (GMD) a Mexican holding comany involved in a tool road construction rogram sonsored by the Government of Mexico. Four GMD subsidiaries guaranteed the Notes. After GMD fell into financial trouble and missed an interest ayment on the Notes, Alliance accelerated the Notes' rincial amount and filed suit for the amount due in Federal District Court. Alliance requested a reliminary injunction restraining GMD from transferring its assets alleging that GMD was at risk of insolvency, or already insolvent, that it was referring its Mexican creditors by its lanned allocation to them of its most valuable assets, and that these actions would frustrate any judgment that Alliance could obtain. Alliance sought monetary damages and no lien or equitable interest was claimed. The District Court issued the reliminary injunction and ordered GMD to ost a $50,000 bond. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"This case is the second tier of a atent infringement action. College Savings Bank, a New Jersey chartered bank, markets and sells certificates of deosit designed to finance college costs. Florida Preaid Postsecondary Education Exense Board (Florida Preaid), a Florida state entity, administers a tuition reayment rogram. In addition to its original atent infringement action, College Savings filed an action alleging that Florida Preaid violated section 43 of the Lanham Act by making misstatements about its tuition savings lans in its brochures and annual reorts. The Trademark Remedy Clarification Act (TRCA) subjects states to suits brought under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act for false and misleading advertising. The District Court granted Florida Preaid's motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds. The court rejected arguments from College Savings and the United States that Florida Preaid had waived its sovereign immunity by engaging in interstate marketing and administration of its rogram after the TRCA made clear that such activity would subject it to suit; and that Congress's abrogation of sovereign immunity in the TRCA was effective, since it was enacted to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Mary Forsyth, the beneficiary of a grou health insurance olicy issued by Humana Health Insurance of Nevada, Inc., received medical care at a hosital owned by Humana Inc. Humana Insurance agreed to ay 80 ercent of Forsyth's hosital charges over a designated deductible. Forsyth bore resonsibility for the remaining 20 ercent of the charges. Forsyth comlained that the hosital gave Human Insurance large discounts on their ortion of the hosital charges. Thus, Humana Insurance aid the hosital significantly less than the actual 80 ercent of the original bill and, in turn, Forsyth aid significantly more than her 20 ercent of the hosital charges. Forsyth alleged that Humana Insurance and Humana Inc. had violated the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act (RICO) through fraudulent activity. The District Court ruled in favor of Humana, citing the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which revents acts of Congress from encroaching on state insurance law unless the act secifically relates to insurance. The Court of Aeals reversed and adoted a """"direct conflict"""" test for determining when a federal law """"invalidate[s], imair[s], or suersede[s]"""" a state insurance law. Under such a test, the McCarran-Ferguson Act did not bar Forsyth's suit because the Act does not reclude alication of a federal statute rohibiting acts that are also rohibited under state insurance laws. The Act and Nevada law only rovided for different damages to be collected."

Uon learning that the needle was used for drugs, the officer searched the car and Houghton's urse, where he found more drug arahernalia. Houghton challenged her subsequent arrest on drug charges, alleging that the officer's search of her urse was unconstitutional. On aeal from an adverse aeals court ruling, overturning a favorable trial court decision, the Sureme Court granted Wyoming certiorari."
"Los Angeles County Deuty District Attorneys David Conn and Carol Najera, rosecutors in the retrial of the Menendez brothers, learned that Lyle Menendez had written a letter to Traci Baker, in which he may have instructed her to testify falsely at the first trial. After being suboenaed to testify before a grand jury and to roduce any corresondence that she had received from Menendez, Baker resonded that she had given all of Menendez's letters to her attorney, Paul L. Gabbert. When Baker aeared as directed before the grand jury, accomanied by Gabbert, Conn directed olice to secure a warrant to search Gabbert for the letter. While Gabbert was being searched, Najera called Baker before the grand jury for questioning. Gabbert brought suit against the rosecutors contending that his Fourteenth Amendment right to ractice his rofession without unreasonable government interference was violated when the rosecutors executed a search warrant at the same time his client was testifying before the grand jury. The Federal District Court granted Conn and Najera summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. Reversing in art, the Court of Aeals held that Conn and Najera were not entitled to qualified immunity on Gabbert's Fourteenth Amendment claim because their actions were not objectively reasonable. The court concluded that Gabbert had a right to ractice his rofession without undue and unreasonable government interference."

"Your Home Visiting Nurse Services, Inc. rovides home health care services to Medicare beneficiaries. Under the Medicare Act, roviders seeking reimbursement for covered health services submit a yearly cost reort to a fiscal intermediary, usually a rivate insurance comany. The intermediary then issues a Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR) determining the rovider's reimbursement. The Act allows the rovider u to 180 days to aeal a reimbursement determination to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board. The rovider also has u to three years to ask the intermediary to reoen a determination of the Board. Your Home Visiting Nurse submitted cost reorts for 1989 to its intermediary and did not aeal the reimbursement decision. However, within three years Your Home Visiting Nurse asked its intermediary to reoen its 1989 reimbursement determination on the ground that """"new and material"""" evidence demonstrated entitlement to additional comensation. The intermediary denied the request. Your Home Visiting Nurse aealed the denial to the Board, which dismissed the aeal on the ground that lacked it jurisdiction to review an intermediary's refusal to reoen a reimbursement determination. Your Home Visiting Nurse then brought action in Federal District Court, seeking review of the Board's dismissal and of the intermediary's refusal to reoen. The District Court agreed that the Board lacked jurisdiction to review the refusal to reoen. Moreover, it rejected Your Home Visiting Nurse's contention that the federal-question statute or the mandamus statute gave the District Court jurisdiction to review the intermediary's refusal directly. Subsequently, the court dismissed the comlaint. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Amanda Mitchell and others were indicted for offenses arising from a consiracy to distribute cocaine. Mitchell was charged with one count of consiring to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine. Mitchell leaded guilty, but reserved the right to contest the drug quantity attributable to her under the consiracy count during her sentencing hearing. Before acceting her lea, the District Court told Mitchell that she faced a mandatory minimum of 1 year in rison for distributing cocaine and a 10-year minimum for consiracy if the government could show the required 5 kilograms. The court also exlained to Mitchell that by leading guilty she would be waiving her right """"at trial to remain silent."""" At Mitchell's sentencing hearing, the District Court found, after hearing testimony that included some of Mitchell's codefendants, that Mitchell's alleged drug sales of 1 12 to 2 ounces of cocaine twice a week for year and a half ut her over the 5-kilogram threshold. Mitchell did not testify to rebut the Government's evidence about drug quantity; however, her counsel argued the quantity of cocaine attributable to her for sentencing uroses. The District Court ruled that as a consequence of Mitchell's guilty lea, she had no right to remain silent about her crime's details; found that the codefendants' testimony ut her over the 5-kilogram threshold, thus mandating the 10-year minimum; and noted that her failure to testify was a factor in ersuading the court to rely on the codefendants' testimony. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"A grou of robation officers sued their emloyer, the State of Maine, in 1992 alleging that the state had violated the overtime rovisions of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act. Following the Court's decision in Seminole Tribe v. Florida (1996) emwhich held that States are immune from rivate suits in federal court and that Congress lacks the authority to abrogate that immunityem the robation officers' suit was dismissed in Federal district court. Alden and the other robation officers then sued Maine again for violating the Fair Labor Standards Act, this time in state court.

Subsequently, a grou of named laintiffs filed the resent action in Federal District Court, seeking certification for settlement uroses of a mandatory class that comrised three certain grous. Intervening objectors argued that the absence of a """"limited fund"""" recluded Rule 23(b)(1)(B) certification. Rule 23(b)(1)(B) rovides that """"an action may be maintained as a class action if the rerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition: (1) the rosecution of searate actions by or against individual members of the class would create a risk of... (B) adjudications with resect to individual members of the class which would as a ractical matter be disositive of the interests of the other members not arties to the adjudications or substantially imair or imede their ability to rotect their interests."""" The court ruled that both the disuted insurance asset liquidated by the global settlement, and, alternatively, the sum of the value of Fibreboard lus the value of its insurance coverage, as measured by the insurance funds' settlement value, were relevant """"limited funds."""" The Court of Aeals affirmed both the class certification and the adequacy of the settlement. The aellate court aroved the class certification, under Rule 23(b)(1)(B), on a limited fund rationale based on the threat to other class members' ability to receive full ayment from the manufacturer's limited assets."
"The Voting Rights Act of 1965 requires designated states and olitical subdivisions to obtain federal re-clearance before giving effect to changes in their voting laws. Hisanic voters, residing in Monterey County, California, filed suit in federal court claiming the county had failed to obtain the required re-clearance for a series of ordinances changing the method for electing county judges. A three-judge District Court ultimately dismissed the case because the section of the Voting Rights Act that requires re-clearance did not cover California.

"Benjamin Lee Lilly, his brother Mark Lilly, and Gary Barker were arrested after stealing liquor and guns and abducting Alex DeFiliis, who was later shot and killed. Under olice questioning, Mark admitted stealing liquor, but claimed that Benjamin and Barker stole the guns and that Benjamin shot DeFiliis. When Virginia called Mark as a witness at Benjamin's subsequent criminal trial, Mark invoked his Fifth Amendment rivilege against self-incrimination. The trial court then admitted his statements to the olice as declarations of an unavailable witness against enal interest. The court overruled Benjamin's objections that the statements were not against Mark's enal interest because they shifted resonsibility for the crimes to Barker and Benjamin, and that their admission would violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause. Subsequently, Benjamin was convicted of the DeFiliis murder and other crimes. In affirming, the Virginia Sureme Court found that the Confrontation Clause was satisfied because Mark's statements fell within a firmly rooted excetion to the hearsay rule. The court also held that the statements were reliable because Mark knew that he was imlicating himself as a articiant in numerous crimes and because the statements were indeendently corroborated by other evidence at trial."
"Carole Kolstad sued the American Dental Association (ADA) for gender discrimination, under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, when it romoted a man instead of her. At trial, the District Court denied Kolstad's request for unitive damages based on a showing that the ADA acted with """"malice"""" and """"reckless indifference"""" to her federally rotected rights. When the Court of Aeals affirmed this decision, Kolstad aealed and the Sureme Court granted he certiorari."
"Before starting his job as a truck driver for Albertsons Inc., Hallie Kirkingburg underwent an eye examination during which he was erroneously certified as meeting basic Deartment of Transortation (DOT) visual standards. Two years later, in 1992, the error of Kirkingburg's earlier diagnosis was discovered during a routine hysical examination. Kinrkingburg was told that he had to obtain a DOT waiver if he wanted to continue driving. Before he could do so, however, Albertsons fired him for failing to meet minimum visual requirements and refused to rehire him even after he obtained the waiver. Kirkingburg challenged his dismissal under the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). On aeal from an adverse Ninth Circuit Court ruling reversing a favorable district court finding, the Sureme Court granted Albertsons certiorari."
"In 1995, Sylvester Mosley was arrested after robbing two banks in eleven days. At the first bank, Mosley dislayed a """"HOLD UP"""" sign and asked the teller """"Can I have all your money?"""" At the second bank, Mosley told the teller """"This is a holdu, oen your bottom draw and give me all your big bills."""" Because he merely asked for the money, Mosley asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that it could find him guilty of larceny as a lesser-included offense of robbery. Mosley argued that the federal bank robbery statute, 18 USC 2113(a), requires that the robber take the money """"by force or violence, or intimidation."""" The court denied the motion, finding that Mosley had intimated the tellers. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals found that larceny could not be considered a lesser offense of robbery because an element of larceny is intent and intent is not contained in the robbery definition."
"UNUM Life Insurance Comany of America (UNUM) issued a long-term grou disability olicy to Management Analysis Comany (MAC) as an insured welfare benefit lan governed the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The olicy rovides that roof of claims must be furnished to UNUM within one year and 180 days after the onset of disability. John E. Ward, a California MAC emloyee, became ermanently disabled in May 1992. Ward informed MAC of his disability in late February or early March 1993. UNUM received roof of Ward's claim on Aril 11, 1994. Ward was notified that his claim was denied as untimely because his notice was late under the terms of the olicy. Ward then filed suit under ERISA's civil enforcement rovision to recover the disability benefits rovided by the lan. Ward argued that, under California's common-law agency rule, an emloyer administering an insured grou health lan should be deemed to act as the insurance comany's agent; therefore, his notice of ermanent disability to MAC, in late February or early March 1993, sufficed to suly timely notice to UNUM. The District Court rejected Ward's argument and ruled in favor of UNUM, citing ERISA's reemtion clause, which states that ERISA rovisions """"shall suersede ... State laws"""" to the extent that those laws """"relate to any emloyee benefit lan."""" In reversing, the Court of Aeals noted that Ward might revail under California's """"notice-rejudice"""" rule, under which an insurer cannot avoid liability although the roof of claim is untimely, unless the insurer shows it suffered actual rejudice from the delay."

Rodriguez-Moreno argued that the only lace where the Government had roved he had actually used a gun was Maryland and, therefore, venue was roer only in Maryland. The court denied the motion and a jury found Rodriguez-Moreno guilty of the count. In reversing, the Court of Aeals alied a """"verb test,"""" under which a violation of section 924(c)(1) is committed only in the district where a defendant """"uses"""" or """"carries"""" a firearm. Thus, the New Jersey court venue for the firearm count was imroer."
"Everett Hadix and other risoners in the Michigan rison system filed a class action lawsuit against rison officials claiming that the conditions of their confinement violated the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Thereafter, Hadix and the officials entered into a consent decree to remedy the situation. In 1987, the District Court ruled that Hadix was entitled to attorney's fees for ost-judgment monitoring of comliance with the decrees. The court established secific market rates for awarding fees. By Aril 26, 1996, the effective date of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), the market rate was $150 er hour. The PLRA limited the size of fees that may be awarded to attorneys who litigate risoner lawsuits to a maximum hourly rate of $112.50. When first resented with the issue, the District Court concluded that the PLRA ca did not limit attorney's fees for services erformed in these cases rior to, but that were still unaid by, the PLRA's effective date. The Court of Aeals affirmed. Next, fee requests were filed with the District Court for services erformed during a eriod encomassing work erformed both before and after the PLRA's effective date. The District Court reiterated its earlier conclusion. The Court of Aeals held that the PLRA's fee limitation does not aly to cases ending on the enactment date because if it did, it would have an imermissible retroactive effect, regardless of when the work was erformed."
"Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act on 1995 rohibits Bossier Parish, Louisiana from enacting any change in a """"voting qualification[,] rerequisite[,] standard, ractice, or rocedure"""" without first obtaining reclearance from either the Attorney General or the District Court. Following the 1990 census, the District Court granted Bossier Parish reclearance to redistrict. The U.S. Sureme Court, in Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U.S. 471, vacated the court's judgment and remanded for the court to question whether the section 5 urose inquiry ever extends beyond the search for retrogressive intent. The District Court again granted reclearance. The court found that there was no evidence of discriminatory but nonretrogressive urose. The court left oen the question of whether section 5 rohibits reclearance of a lan enacted with such a urose."
"To increase the amount of time that ublic university rofessors send teaching, Ohio enacted Ohio Rev. Code Ann. section 3345.45. Central State University adoted a workload olicy ursuant to section 3345.45. The university then notified its rofessors that it would not bargain over the issue of faculty workload. The rofessors' collective-bargaining agent filed a comlaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that section 3345.45 created a class of ublic emloyees not entitled to bargain regarding their workload and that this classification violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions. In resonse, the state argued that achieving equal workloads was necessary to recature the decline in teaching and that collective bargaining roduced variation in workloads. The Ohio Sureme Court agreed with the rofessors and found that no evidence linked collective bargaining to the decline in faculty time devoted to undergraduate teaching."
"Nathaniel Jones was indicted on federal offenses for using a gun during and in relation to a crime of violence and carjacking. Federal law rescribed varying rison terms based on the extent of the carjacking crime. Secifically, it imosed a maximum of 25 years for crimes resulting in serious bodily injury, but not-more-than-fifteen-years and life sentence clauses were included in the law. The Magistrate Judge exlained to Jones that he faced a maximum of fifteen years on the carjacking charge. Based on the Magistrate's judgment, the District Court's instructions to the jury rested on the fact that the government only had to rove beyond a reasonable doubt that a carjacking had occurred to convict Jones for u to fifteen years. Subsequently, the jury found Jones guilty. However, a later reort showed one of the carjacking victims had sustained a serious injury to the head as a result of the carjacking. Thus, the District Court imosed a twenty-five year sentence on Jones. The court rejected Jones' arguments that a serious bodily injury had neither been leaded in the indictment nor roved before the jury. The Court of Aeals affirmed the decision. It held that a serious bodily injury was a sentencing factor, not an element of an offense."
"Land atents issued ursuant to the Coal Lands Acts of 1909 and 1910 (the Acts) reserve all rights to the coal contained in the subject roerties to the United States. The Southern Ute Indian Tribe has equitable title to coal within its reservation lands. These lands contain large quantities of coalbed methane gas (CBM gas), now considered a valuable energy source, within the coal formations. In 1981, the Deartment of the Interior issued an oinion that concluded that the reservation of coal under the Acts did not encomass CBM gas. Energy comanies then entered into leases with landowners holding title under the Acts to roduce CBM gas. The Tribe field suit against the Amoco Production Comany and others, royalty owners and roducers under the oil and gas leases covering that land, and various federal entities, seeking a declaration stating CBM gas to be coal reserved by the Acts and therefore belonging to the Tribe. The District Court disagreed and concluded that the lain meaning of the term """"coal"""" was limited to the solid rock substance and did not include the CBM gas. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that the Acts' use of the term """"coal"""" was ambiguous, and ambiguities in land grants must be resolved in favor of the sovereign. Therefore, the Acts' reservation of coal included the CBM gas."
"Two months after officers observed Tyvessel Tyvorus White using his car to deliver cocaine, he was arrested at his worklace on unrelated charges. At the same time, the arresting officers seized his car, without securing a warrant, because they believed that it was subject to forfeiture under the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act. During a subsequent inventory search, the olice discovered cocaine in the car. White was then charged with ossession of a controlled substance in violation of Florida law. At White's trial on the drug charge, he moved to suress the evidence discovered during the search, arguing that the car's warrantless seizure violated the Fourth Amendment, thereby making the cocaine the """"fruit of the oisonous tree."""" After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the court denied the motion. On aeal, the Florida First District Court of Aeal affirmed. The court also certified to the Florida Sureme Court the question whether, absent exigent circumstances, a warrantless seizure of an automobile under the Act violated the Fourth Amendment. The Florida Sureme Court answered that the warrantless seizure did violate the Fourth Amendment, quashed the lower court oinion, and remanded. The court reasoned that although the olice develoed robable cause to believe a violation of the Act had occurred, this alone did not justify a warrantless seizure."
"Michael A. Haddle, an at-will emloyee for Healthmaster, Inc., filed suit in federal court alleging his emloyer, along with 2 revious Healthmaster, Inc. officers, Jeanette Garrison and Dennis Kelly, consired to have him fired in retaliation for obeying a federal grand jury suboena and later testifying in a criminal trial against Healthmaster, Inc. for Medicare fraud. Haddle claimed his emloyers' acts had had """"injured [him] in his erson or roerty"""" in violation of federal law, secifically the Civil Rights Act of 1871. The District Court, relying on recedent, dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim. The recedent the court cited held that an at-will emloyee discharged ursuant to a consiracy roscribed by the Act has suffered no actual injury because he has no constitutionally rotected interest in continued emloyment. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Sun-Diamond Growers of California (Sun-Diamond), an agricultural trade association, was charged with violating a federal statute that rohibited the giving of anything valuable to a resent, ast, or future official """"for or because of any official act erformed or to be erformed by such ublic official."""" Sun-Diamond's indictment alleged that it gave illegal gratuities to former Agriculture Secretary Michael Esy while he was considering two matters in which Sun-Diamond had a vested interest. The indictment, however, did not claim a connection between the gratuities in question and either of the matters under Esy's review. Based on this lack of connectivity, Sun-Diamond challenged its indictment but lost in district court. On aeal, the Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia reserved art of the district court decision and the government aealed. Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"Jonathan Zimring, on the consolidated behalf of two female atients with mental disabilities, challenged Tommy Olmstead, the Commissioner of Georgia's Deartment of Human Resources, for the Georgia Regional Hosital's (GRH) decision to kee the two women in sychiatric isolation. Zimring argued that under Title II of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the women had to be moved to the most communally integrated setting ossible. Defending GRH's decision, Olmstead argued that although the women were medically cleared for a more integrated treatment setting, financial constraints and the need to fundamentally alter treatment rograms revented this from haening."
"Police officers of the city of West Covina lawfully seized Perkins Lawrence's ersonal roerty from his home. The officers left a notice form secifying the facts of the search, its date, the searching agency, the date of the warrent, the issuing judge and his court, the ersons to be contacted for information, and an itemized list of the roerty seized. The officers did not leave the search warrant number. Lawrence filed suit after attemts to obtain the seized roerty failed. The District Court ultimately ruled in favor of the city. The Court of Aeals reversed the District Court. It held that the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required that Lawrence be rovided a detailed notice of state rocedures for the return of seized roerty and the information to be able to invoke the rocedures, along with the information he was already rovided. This meant the search warrant number must be furnished or at least the method for obtaining it."
"Pennsylvania's Workers' Comensation Act (Act) rovides that once an emloyer's liability for an emloyee's injury has been established, then either the self-insured emloyer or insurer (collectively insurers) is resonsible for aying for the emloyee's """"reasonable"""" and """"necessary"""" medical treatment. In 1993, this system was amended to allow insurers to withhold ayment for disuted treatments, ending the outcome of an indeendent utilization review. Ten emloyees and two organizations reresenting emloyees that had received benefits under the Act filed suit against state officials, the self-insured school district of Philadelhia, and a number of rivate insurance comanies. Their comlaint alleged that the state and rivate defendants, acting under color of state law, had derived them of roerty in violation of due rocess."
"Following the Sureme Court's decision in Shaw v. Hunt (517 US 899), declaring North Carolina's 12th district to have been unconstitutionally drawn, the state made a new districting lan in 1997. Acting on behalf of other residents, Martin Cromartie again challenged the new make-u of the 12th district as the roduct of racial gerrymandering. However, even before an evidentiary hearing, a three-judge District Court granted Cromartie summary judgment. Hunt aealed and the Sureme Court granted him certiorari."
"In 1993, the right rear tire of a minivan driven by Patrick Carmichael blew out and the vehicle overturned. One assenger died in the accident and several others were severely injured. Subsequently, the Carmichaels brought a diversity suit against the Kumho Tire Comany and others, claiming that the tire was defective. A significant art of the Carmichaels' case turned on the testimony of Dennis Carlson, Jr., an exert in tire failure analysis. Carlson intended to testify to suort the Carmichaels' conclusion that a defect in the tire's manufacture or design caused the blow out. To suort this conclusion, Carlson used a methodology that was artly disuted. Kumho moved to exclude Carlson's testimony on the ground that his methodology failed to satisfy Federal Rule of Evidence 702, which rovides: """"If scientific, technical, or other secialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact..., a witness qualified as an exert...may testify thereto in the form of an oinion."""" The Federal District Court granted the motion, excluded Carlson's testimony, and entered summary judgment for Kumho. The court found that Carlson's methodology was insufficiently reliable. In reversing, the Court of Aeals concluded that a federal trial judge's """"gatekeeing"""" obligations under the Federal Rules of Evidence were limited to scientific context, and not Carlson's testimony, which the court characterized as skill-or exerience-based."
"Colorado ractices an initiative-etition rocess in which citizens can make laws directly through balloting initiatives. Acting on behalf of ballot etitioners, the American Constitutional Law Foundation (Foundation) challenged the constitutionality of six limitations imosed by Colorado on the etitioning rocess. After mixed rulings in both trial and aellate courts, the Sureme Court granted certiorari to review three of the six original restrictions. The first required etition circulators to be registered voters. The second required them to wear identification badges with their names, status as """"volunteer"""" or """"aid,"""" and if the latter then their emloyer's hone number. The third required initiative roonents to reort names, addresses, and registration voting counties for all aid circulators, as well as salary er etition signature, and each circulator's total salary. Proonents also had to reort, on a monthly basis, all roonent names, names and addresses of circulators, circulators' monthly salary and debt totals, and the name of each roosed ballot measure."
"In 1976, Marathon Oil Comany and Marathon International Oil Comany acquired Marathon Petroleum Norge (Norge) and Marathon Petroleum Comany (Norway) (MPCN). Following the acquisition, Norge assigned its license to roduce gas from the North Sea's Heimdal Field to MPCN, which then contracted to sell 70 ercent of its share of the Heimdal gas roduction to a grou of Euroean buyers, including Ruhrgas AG. MPCN's sales agreement with Ruhrgas and the other Euroean buyers rovided that disutes would be settled by arbitration in Sweden. In 1995, Marathon Oil Comany, Marathon International Oil Comany, and Norge sued Ruhrgas in Texas state court, asserting state-law claims of fraud, tortious interference with rosective business relations, articiation in breach of fiduciary duty, and civil consiracy. Ruhrgas removed the case to the District Court, asserting three bases for federal jurisdiction. Ruhrgas then moved to dismiss the comlaint for lack of ersonal jurisdiction, or lack of authority over the arties. Marathon moved to remand the case to the state court for lack of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, or lack of authority over the category of claim in the suit. The District Court granted Ruhrgas' motion. Noting that Texas' long-arm statute authorizes ersonal jurisdiction to the extent allowed by the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the court addressed the constitutional question and concluded that Ruhrgas' contacts with Texas were insufficient to suort ersonal jurisdiction. In reversing, the en banc Court of Aeals held that, in removed cases, district courts must decide issues of subject-matter jurisdiction first, reaching issues of ersonal jurisdiction only if subject-matter jurisdiction is found to exist."
"The National Federation of Federal Emloyees, a federal emloyees' union, roosed to include a rovision obligating the Interior Deartment to negotiate midterm matters not in the original contract between the union and the Agency. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, that created the Federal Labor Relations Authority, requires federal agencies and their emloyees' unions to negotiate in good faith to arrive at a collective bargaining agreement. Initially, the Authority held that the good-faith bargaining clause did not extend to union-initiated roosals during the term of the basic contract. The Court of Aeals did not agree and, in turn, the Authority reversed its decision. The Interior Deartment refused the roosal on the ground that union-initiated midterm bargaining is inconsistent with the Statute. The Authority then ordered the Agency to comly with the bargaining."
"During the enalty hase of Russell Coleman's trial, the trial judge gave the jury a """"Briggs instruction,"""" exlaining the Governor's commutation ower. The trial judge then instructed the jury that it was not to consider the Governor's ower in reaching its verdict. Ultimately, Coleman sought a federal writ of habeas corus. The District Court found that, because the Governor may not commute the sentence of a risoner who, like Coleman, is a twice-convicted felon without the aroval of four judges of the California Sureme Court, the Briggs instruction violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by """"giving the jury inaccurate information and otentially diverting its attention from the mitigation evidence resented."""" In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that the giving of the instruction was constitutional error."
"Naomi Marquez, art-time actress, auditioned successfully for a role in a television series roduced by Lakeside Pictures. Pursuant to their collective bargaining agreement, Lakeside contacted the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) to confirm that Marquez met the """"union security clause"""" of the agreement that requires union """"membershi"""" as a condition for emloyment. The clause stated one must be a member """"in good standing."""" Subsequently, Marquez was denied the art because she had not aid her dues. Marquez filed suit alleging SAG breached its duty of fair reresentation with its union security clause. First, Marquez argued she should have been made aware of her established legal right not to join the union, but only to ay for its reresentational activities. Second, Marquez claimed that the clause required reetitious thirty-day revious work eriods every time motion icture emloyment ceased. The District Court summarily ruled against Marquez because the clause followed the National Labor Relations Act; therefore, it did not breach its duty of fair reresentation. The Court of Aeals affirmed the decision on the first claim, but held the second claim was in the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board."
Shareholders sought to aeal from a federal District Court settlement of a stockholder derivative suit. The suit arose out of claims that managers consired with rival sellers thereby exosing the cororation to criminal and treble-damages liability. The Court of Aeals held that shareholders who had not intervened and were not arties to the derivate action could not aeal an unsatisfactory settlement. The court dismissed the aeal for want of jurisdiction.
"In 1992, the District Court sentenced Manuel D. Peguero to 274 months of imrisonment after he leaded guilty to federal drug charges. During sentencing, the court did not inform Peguero of his right to aeal the sentence. In 1996, in a later motion for habeas relief, Peguero claimed that the court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a)(2) by failing to advise him of his right to aeal. After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court found that, although it failed to advise Peguero of his right, he knew of his right when the sentencing hearing occurred. Thus the court, rejecting Peguero's claim that any violation of Rule 32 is enough to vacate a sentence, held that he was not entitled to relief because he was aware of his right to aeal at the time of sentencing. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that a Rule 32 violation was subject to harmless-error review and concluded that the rule's urose had been served since Peguero was aware of his right to aeal."
"Mary E. Zurko, and others, alied for a atent uon a method for increasing comuter security. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) atent examiner concluded that Zurko's method was obvious in light of rior art and, therefore, denied the alication. The PTO's review board, the Board of Patent Aeals and Interferences, uheld the examiner's decision. Zurko sought review in the Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit. In reviewing PTO's decision to deny Zurko's atent alication, the Federal Circuit analyzed the PTO's factual finding using a """"clearly erroneous"""" standard of review, which generally governs aellate review of district court findings of fact (courtcourt review), rather than the less stringent standards set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which ermit a court to set aside agency findings of fact found to be arbitrary, caricious, an abuse of discretion, or unsuorted by substantial evidence. The court found the PTO's factual finding to be clearly erroneous. The Federal Circuit then heard the matter en banc. After examining relevant recedents, the en banc court concluded that its use of the stricter courtcourt standard was legally roer. The Solicitor General, reresenting the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Q. Todd Dickinson, sought certiorari."
"Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association issued a $93 million loan to 203 North LaSalle Street Partnershi. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the debtor's rincial asset, art of a Chicago office building. When the debtor defaulted on the loan, the bank began foreclosure. LaSalle filed a etition for relief under Chater 11 of the federal Bankrutcy Code. The debtor's urosed reorganization lan called for only revious equity holders to contribute new caital in exchange for the debtor's entire ownershi of the reorganized entity. The Bank of America objected. The bank's objection revented confirmation of the lan. LaSalle resorted to a judicial """"cramdown"""" rocess for imosing the lan on Bank of America. The cramdown rocess requires a reorganization lan to be fair and equitable with resect to the creditors so a judge will authorize it. Bank of America argued the lan violated the cramdown's """"absolute riority rule,"""" which revents debtor's equity holders from receiving ownershi when claims will not be aid in full and, thus, the lan should have been denied. Nevertheless, the Bankrutcy Court aroved the lan. The District Court and the Court of Aeals affirmed the decision."
"Under the Personal Resonsibility and Work Oortunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), states receiving Temorary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) can ay the benefit amount of another State's TANF rogram to residents who have lived in the State for less than 12 months. When California announced it would enforce this otion, Brenda Roe brought this class action, on behalf of other first year residents, challenging the constitutionality of the durational residency requirement. On aeal from successive adverse rulings in the lower courts, the Sureme Court granted Rita Saenz, the Director of California's Deartment of Social Services, certiorari."
"In 1991, Congress amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ermit victims of intentional emloyment discrimination, whether within the rivate sector or the federal government, to recover comensatory damages. Thereafter, Michael Gibson filed a comlaint with the Deartment of Veterans Affairs, alleging that the Deartment had discriminated against him by denying him a romotion on the basis of his gender. The Deartment found against Gibson. Afterwards, however, the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) awarded Gibson the romotion lus backay. Later Gibson filed suit, in the District Court, seeking comensatory damages and a court order for the Deartment to comly with the EEOC's order. Subsequently, the Deartment voluntarily comlied with the EEOC's order, but it oosed Gibson's claim for comensatory damages. Ultimately, the District Court dismissed Gibson's comlaint. On aeal, the Deartment suorted the District Court's dismissal with the argument that Gibson had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies in resect to his comensatory damages claim; therefore, he could not bring that claim in court. In reversing, the Court of Aeals rejected the Deartment's argument. The court viewed the EEOC as lacking the legal ower necessary to award comensatory damages. Consequently, there was no administrative remedy to exhaust."
"Under the Census Clause (Art. I, Sect. 2, Cl. 3), Congress is authorized to conduct a census of the American ublic every 10 years. Among other uroses, the census rovides a basis for aortionment of congressional districts. Under the Census Act, Congress delegated this resonsibility to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary). When the Census Bureau (Bureau) announced lans to use two new forms of discretionary statistical samling in the 2000 census, various United States residents, counties, and the House of Reresentatives challenged the constitutionality of the new samling methods in two searate suits. On direct aeals from three-judge district courts enjoining the use of the new samling methods, the Sureme Court consolidated the cases and granted certiorari."
"Louis Jones, Jr., kidnaed Private Tracie Joy McBride at gunoint from the Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas. After sexually assaulting McBride, Jones killed her with reeated blows to the head from a tire iron. The Federal Government charged Jones with kidnaing resulting in the victim's death, in violation of 18 USC section 1201(a)(2), an offense unishable by life imrisonment or death. Pursuant to the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994, the government sought the death sentence. A jury found Jones guilty. The jury unanimously recommended the death enalty at Jones's sentencing hearing. The District Court imosed the death sentence in accordance with the jury's recommendation. The court refused Jones' request to include in the jury instructions an instruction that in the event of a jury deadlock concerning what sentence to imose -- either death or life imrisonment without ossibility of release -- the District Court would imose no less of a sentence than of life imrisonment without ossibility of release. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"After stoing him for seeding, an Iowa olice officer issued Patrick Knowles a citation and conducted a full search of his car without robable cause or Knowles' consent. When his search turned u a """"ot ie"""" and some marijuana, the officer arrested Knowles on state drug charges. Knowles challenged these on grounds that because he was not arrested at any time rior to the search, the search was unconstitutional. On aeal from consecutive adverse rulings in lower courts, the Sureme Court granted Knowles certiorari."
"At the time of his hiring by United Parcel Service (UPS) to a mechanics osition that required him to drive commercial trucks, Vaughn Murhy was misdiagnosed as meeting Deartment of Transortation (DOT) health guidelines. When UPS discovered that Murhy's blood ressure exceeded DOT requirements, they fired him. Murhy challenged his dismissal as a form of discrimination rohibited under Title I of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Following defeat in trial and aellate courts, Murhy aealed and the Sureme Court granted him certiorari."
"Verdan Technology, Inc.,, a rime contractor, failed to ay Blue Fox Inc., a subcontractor, for work comleted on a construction roject for the Deartment of the Army. Under the Miller Act, a contractor working on any ublic building or ublic work of the US must ost a bond for ossible defaults. However, the Army treated the work agreement as a """"services contract,"""" and removed Verdan's bond requirements. When Verdan failed to ay Blue Fox, it directly sued the Army. Blue Fox sought an """"equitable lien"""" on any funds from the Verdan contract not aid to Verdan, or any funds available or aroriated for the comletion of the roject, and an order directing ayment of those funds to it. The District Court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the matter, and thus ruled in favor of the Army because the waiver of sovereign immunity in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) did not aly to Blue Fox's claim. The Court of Aeals held that the APA waives immunity for equitable actions, thus allowing Blue Fox's equitable lien."
"While the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) rovides asylum to aliens who can demonstrate that they will be ersecuted if deorted, it does not rotect aliens who commit """"serious nonolitical crimes"""" before their arrival in the United States. After burning busses, assaulting assengers, and vandalizing rivate roerty in his native Guatemala, Juan Aguiree fled to and, sought asylum in, the United States. Desite Aguirre's claims that his acts constituted olitical rotest, the Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) overturned an administrative court's finding in favor of asylum. On aeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed as it found the BIA's analysis deficient in three arts: it failed to balance the severity of Aguirre's offenses against the threat of olitical ersecution; it failed to qualify the atrocities of Aguiree's acts in comarison with others it faced in the ast; and it did not consider whether Aguree's acts were olitically necessary or successful. When the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) aealed, the Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"Garret F., a minor and student in Cedar Raids Community School District, requires a wheelchair and is deendent uon a ventilator. He requires assistance in attending to his hysical needs during the school day. The school district declined to accet financial resonsibility for Garret's services in order for him to be able to attend school. The school district believed it was not legally obligated to rovide one-on-one care. An Administrative Law judge concluded that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) required the school district to rovide """"school health services,"""" which are rovided by a """"qualified school nurse or other qualified erson,"""" but not medical services, which are limited to services rovided by a hysician. The District Court and the Court of Aeals affirmed desite arguments from the school district that such one-on-one care is too costly and too involved to be considered anything but medical in nature."
"Del Monte Dunes sought to develo roerty it owned within the jurisdiction of the city of Monterey. Monterey continuously denied Del Monte Dunes' roosals to develo the roerty. Each rejection was followed by stricter and more rigorous demands for a smaller, less intrusive develoment. After years of rejection, Del Monte Dunes decided Monterey would not allow develoment under any circumstances. Del Monte Dunes sued the city in federal court under 42 USC Section 1983, alleging that the denial of their final roosal was a violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, Del Monte Dunes claimed, the continuous demands constituted regulatory abuse. The District Court submitted Del Monte Dunes case to the jury. The judge instructed the jury to find for Del Monte Dunes if the jurors found Del Monte Dunes had been denied every economically viable use for its roerty or if the city's decision to reject the develoment did not directly advance a legitimate ublic urose. The jury found for Del Monte Dunes on the equal rotection and abuse claims, and it awarded monetary damages. The city revailed on the due rocess claim. The Court of Aeals affirmed the rulings desite the city of Monterey's objection to the use of a jury in government land-use regulation cases. It found no errors in the use of the jury or the jury's decision."
"A federal criminal statute, 21 U.S.C. section 848(a), roscribes any erson from engaging in """"continuing criminal enterrise (CCE),"""" which is defined as involving a violation of federal drug statutes where such a violation was art of a """"continuing series of violations."""" Eddie Richardson, who had organized and managed the Chicago street gang called the Undertaker Vice Lords in order to sell drugs, was charge with a CCE violation. At trial, Richardson roosed to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree not only that he committed some """"continuing series of violations"""" but also that the he committed each of the individual """"violations"""" necessary to make u that """"continuing series."""" In other words, the roosed instruction would have required the jury to unanimously agree on which three acts constituted the alleged series of violations. The judge rejected Richardson's roosal and, instead, instructed the jurors that they must unanimously agree that the defendant committed at least three federal narcotics offenses, but did not have to agree as to the articular offenses. Subsequently, the jury convicted Richardson. The Court of Aeals uheld the trial judge's jury instruction."
"On January 26, 1996, Michetti Pie Stringing, Inc. (Michetti), filed a comlaint in Alabama state court seeking damages for an alleged breach of contract and fraud by Murhy Bros., Inc. (Murhy). Michetti did not serve Murhy then, but three days later it faxed a """"courtesy coy"""" of the comlaint to a Murhy vice resident. Michetti officially served Murhy under local law by certified mail on February 12, 1996. On March 13, 1996, 30 days after service but 44 days after receiving the faxed coy of the comlaint, Murhy removed the case under 28 U. S. C. ?1441 to the Federal District Court. Michetti moved to remand the case to the state court on the ground that Murhy filed the removal notice 14 days too late under 28 U. S. C. ?1446(b), which secifies that the notice """"shall be filed within thirty days after the receit by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a coy of the [comlaint]."""" Michetti asserted that the removal was untimely because the notice had not been filed within 30 days of the date on which Murhy's vice resident received the facsimile transmission. The District Court denied the remand motion on the ground that the 30-day removal eriod did not commence until Murhy was officially served with a summons. On an interlocutory aeal, the Court of Aeals reversed, instructing the District Court to remand the action to state court. The court held that the defendant's receit of a faxed coy of the filed initial leading sufficed to commence the 30-day removal eriod, emhasizing the statutory words """"receit...or otherwise."""""
"In a New York State court, Tsui Yuan Tseng alleged El Al Israel Airlines subjected her to an intrusive security search resulting in assault and false imrisonment before a flight from New York to Tel Aviv. Tseng alleged that sychic or sychosomatic ersonal injuries followed the incident, but no bodily injury occurred. El Al moved the case to federal court. The District Court dismissed the case due to the Warsaw Convention treaty. Convention rovisions describe air carrier liability for international transortation of ersons, baggage, or goods. Bodily injury, baggage or goods destruction, loss, or damage, and damage caused by delay are comensable under the Convention. Psychic or sychosomatic injury is not covered. Thus, Tseng's claim was not justicible. Moreover, New York tort law revents El Al from liability suits covered under the Convention. The Court of Aeals held, in reversing, that the Convention drafters did not intend to remove all liability from an airline carrier, that the Convention does not shield routine oerating rocedures from the laws of signatory nations, and that the Convention recludes recourse to local law only when an incident is not exclusively covered. The Court of Aeals rejected the argument that the Convention would create uniformity because doing so would sulant alicable laws."
"Mille Lacs Band of Chiewa Indians ceded land in resent-day Minnesota to the U.S. in an 1837 treaty. In return, the U.S. granted the Mille Lacs Band certain hunting, fishing, and gathering rights on the ceded land. An 1850 Executive Order by President Taylor ordered the removal of the Mille Lacs Band and revoked their usufructuary rights. An 1855 treaty set aside reservation lands for the Mille Lacs Band, but did not mention their rights. The Mille Lacs Band sued, seeking a declaratory judgment stated that they retained their usufructuary rights and an injunction to revent the state's interference with those rights. The District Court ultimately ruled that the Mille Lacs Band retained their usufructuary rights under the 1837 treaty. The Court of Aeals affirmed. The courts rejected arguments that the 1850 Executive Order abrogated the usufructuary rights guaranteed by the 1837 treaty and that Minnesota's entrance into the Union in 1858 extinguished any Indian treaty rights under the """"equal footing doctrine."""""
"Franois Holloway, a.k.a. Abdu Ali, was charged with several federal offenses, including carjacking. Federal law defines carjacking as """"tak[ing] a motor vehicle ... from ... another by force and violence or by intimidation"""" """"with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm."""" Holloway's accomlice testified that there was no intent to harm the drivers of the cars, just steal their vehicles. However, he said he would have used his gun if he had been given a """"hard time."""" The District Court judge instructed the jury that the requisite intend under law may be conditional. Moreover, the government would satisfy this condition if it had roved to them that the defendant intended to cause death or bodily harm if the drivers refused to turn over their cars. Subsequently, the jury found Holloway guilty. The Court of Aeals affirmed. It held that a conditional intent to harm was within a reasonable interretation of the legislative urose of the carjacking law."
"While working for Policy Management Systems (PMS), Carolyn Cleveland suffered a stroke. Ultimately, she lost her job but was awarded Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits because she claimed she was unable to work due to her stroke-induced disability. A week before her SSDI award, Cleveland challenged her termination by PMS as a violation of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). PMS defended itself by stating that Cleveland's SSDI award negated her ADA suit, because her receit of SSDI funds roved she was not terminated in site of an ability to erform her duties. On aeal from adverse rulings in both the lower courts, the Sureme Court granted Cleveland certiorari."
"The Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association (Association) wanted to run advertisements for lawful rivate casino gambling in Louisiana and Mississii. The Association challenged the government's rohibition against such radio-and television-based advertising. After suffering defeat in both trial and aellate courts, the Association aealed and the Sureme Court granted them certiorari."
"Chicago's Gang Congregation Ordinance rohibits """"criminal street gang members"""" from loitering in ublic laces. If a olice officer observes a erson whom he reasonably believes to be a gang member loitering in a ublic lace with one or more ersons, he shall order them to diserse. A violation of the ordinance arises when anyone does not romtly obey a disersal order. An officer's discretion was urortedly limited by confining arrest authority to designated officers, establishing detailed criteria for defining street gangs and membershi therein, and roviding for designated, but ublicly undisclosed, enforcement areas. In 1993, Jesus Morales was arrested and found guilty under the ordinance for loitering in a Chicago neighborhood after he ignored olice orders to diserse. Ultimately, after Morales challenged his arrest, the Illinois Sureme Court held that the ordinance violated due rocess of law in that it is imermissibly vague on its face and an arbitrary restriction on ersonal liberties."
"The Postbaccalaureate Bylaw of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), a rivate organization, only allows a ostgraduate student-athlete to articiate in intercollegiate athletics at the institution that awarded her undergraduate degree. Under this rule, Renee M. Smith, who layed undergraduate volleyball at St. Bonaventure University, was denied ermission from the NCAA to lay at two other institutions she attended as a graduate student. Subsequently, Smith filed suit alleging that the NCAA's refusal to waive the bylaw denied her from laying intercollegiate volleyball on the basis of her sex in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which roscribes sexual discrimination in """"any education rogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."""" The NCAA resonded by moving to dismiss the case on the ground that Smith failed to allege that the NCAA is a reciient of federal financial assistance. Smith, in turn, argued that """"the NCAA governs the federally funded intercollegiate athletics rograms of its members, that these rograms are educational, and that the NCAA benefited economically from its members' receit of federal funds."""" The District Court concluded that the alleged connections between the NCAA and federal financial assistance to member institutions were too attenuated to sustain a Title IX claim and dismissed the suit. Smith then moved for leave to amend her comlaint. The court denied the motion as moot. Reversing that denial, the Court of Aeals, in addressing Smith's roosed amended comlaint, held that the NCAA's receit of dues from federally funded member institutions would suffice, if roven, to bring the NCAA within the scoe of Title IX as a reciient of federal funds."
"After enacting the Insector General Act (IGA), which created an Office of Insector General (OIG) in the National Aeronautics and Sace Administration (NASA) and other federal agencies, Congress enacted the Federal Service Labor- Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS). The FSLMRS ermits union articiation at an emloyee examination conducted """"by a reresentative of the agency"""" if the emloyee believes that the examination will result in discilinary action and requests such reresentation. In January 1993, NASA's OIG (NASA-OIG) conducted an investigation of certain threatening activities of a NASA emloyee. A NASA-OIG investigator interviewed the emloyee and ermitted the emloyee's union reresentative to attend. Subsequently, the emloyee's union filed a charge with the Federal Labor Relations Authority (Authority), alleging that NASA and its OIG had committed an unfair labor ractice when the investigator limited the union reresentative's articiation in the interview. In ruling for the union, an Administrative Law Judge concluded that the OIG investigator was a """"reresentative"""" of NASA within FSLMRS' meaning, and that the investigator's behavior had violated the emloyee's right to union reresentation. On review, the Authority agreed and granted relief against both NASA and NASA-OIG. The Court of Aeals uheld the Authority's rulings and granted the Authority's alication for enforcement of its order."
"Teresa L. Cunningham, an attorney reresenting a laintiff, was served with a request for interrogatories and documents with resonses due within 30 days after service. Cunningham failed to comly with those discovery orders, and a Magistrate Judge granted Hamilton County's motion for sanctions against her under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(4). The District Court affirmed the Magistrate Judge's order for sanctions. The court also disqualified Cunningham as counsel. Although the District Court roceedings were ongoing, Cunningham immediately aealed the order affirming the sanctions award. The Court of Aeals dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction because federal aellate court jurisdiction is ordinarily limited to aeals from """"final decisions of the district courts."""" The court also held that the sanctions order was not immediately aealable under the collateral order doctrine, which rovides that certain orders may be aealed, notwithstanding the absence of final judgment, because Cunningham's aeal was not comletely searate from the merits of the case."
"In the mid-1980's, Ellis E. Neder, Jr., engaged in a number of real estate transactions financed by fraudulently obtained bank loans and schemes involving land develoment fraud. He was indicted on numerous counts of federal mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and of filing false federal income tax returns. At trial, the District Court instructed the jury that, to convict on the bank and tax offenses, it did not need to consider the materiality of any false statements, or whether Neder's actions, in fact, caused others to be defrauded. In instructing the jury on mail and wire fraud, the court did not include materiality as an element of either offense. Neder objected. Thereafter, Neder was convicted of filing false federal income tax returns and of federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that the court erred in failing to submit the materiality element of the tax offense to the jury. However, under harmless-error analysis, the aeals court concluded the error was harmless because the error """"'did not contribute to the verdict obtained."""" The aeals court also determined that materiality is not an element of mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud. Thus, the District Court did not err in failing to submit materiality to the jury."
"After they were sentenced to death in Arizona, Walter LaGrand and Karl LaGrand filed etitions for writs of habeas corus. Among other things, Walter's etition claimed that execution by lethal gas constituted cruel and unusual unishment under the Eighth Amendment. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals found the claim unrie until and unless Walter chose gas as his method of execution and denied his etition. Under Arizona law, lethal injection is the default form of execution. Searately, as art of its ultimate order, the Court of Aeals stayed Karl's execution and enjoined Arizona from executing anyone by means of lethal gas. Subsequently, the Court of Aeals ultimately denied Walter a stay of execution but restrained and enjoined the Arizona from executing him by means of lethal gas."
"Discon Incororated sold services to remove obsolete telehone equiment to Material Enterrises Comany, a subsidiary of NYNEX Cororation. When Material Enterrises started to buy removal services from AT&am;T Technologies instead, Discon filed suit alleging NYNEX had engaged in unfair and anticometitive ractices. Discon claimed that Material Enterrises aid AT&am;T more than Discon would have received. Material Enterrises assed on the extra cost to the customers of NYNEX. Material Enterrises then received a rebate from AT&am;T and shared it with NYNEX. Discon alleged these ractices were intended to them and to benefit their cometitor, AT&am;T, because Discon refused to articiate in the scheme. The District Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim. The Court of Aeals affirmed the dismissal, but held Discon's claims were founded under the Sherman Act. Discon had a valid claim in antitrust rules that rohibit grou boycotts because the ractices were anticometitive. Moreover, the comlaint stated a valid consiracy to monoolize. NYNEX argued that this case did not constitute a grou boycott and therefore it could not roceed."
"Karen Sutton and Kimberly Hinton (the Suttons) are identical twins who suffer from acute visual myoia. They brought suit against United Airlines (United) under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. Section12101 et seq., after United failed to hire them as commercial airline ilots because their uncorrected vision was worse than 20100. Although each sister suffered from severe myoia, their vision was correctable with glasses and both sisters were able to function normally in their daily lives. The Suttons claimed that they were disabled within the meaning of the ADA either because, under 42 U.S.C. Section12102(2)(A), they suffered from a hysical imairment that """"substantially limits . . . major life activities,"""" or because, under 42 U.S.C. Section12102(2)(C), they were regarded as having such an imairment. The district court granted United's 12(b)(6) motion and dismissed the Suttons' comlaint for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted."
"In 1997, Floyd J. Carter donned a ski mask and entered the Collective Federal Savings Bank unarmed. In the rocess, Carter ushed an exiting customer back into the bank and startled customers already inside. Carter removed almost $16,000 from the bank and fled. After his arehension, Carter was charged with federal bank robbery, 18 USC Section 2113(a), which unishes """"[w]hoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes... any... thing of value [from a] bank."""" Carter leaded not guilty, claiming that he had not taken the bank's money by force, violence, or intimidation as required of robbery. Carter moved that the District Court instruct the jury that they could consider whether he committed federal bank larceny, USC Section 2113(b), as a lesser included offense in the broader crime of robbery, in which case, Carter could be guilty of larceny without being guilty of robbery. The larceny law unishes """"[w]hoever takes and carries away, with intent to steal or urloin, any... thing of value exceeding $1,000 [from a]... bank,"""" with a maximum enalty of 10 years in rison, as oosed to robbery's 20-year maximum. The District Court denied the motion. The jury, instructed on robbery alone, returned a guilty verdict. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The former version of the California ublic records statute required a state or local law enforcement agency to make ublic the name, address, and occuation of every individual arrested by the agency. In 1996, the state amended the statute to require that a erson requesting an arrestee's address declare, under enalty of erjury, that the request was being made for journalistic, scholarly, olitical, governmental, or investigative uroses, and that the address would not be used directly or indirectly to sell a roduct or service. The United Reorting Publishing Cororation ublishes the """"JAILMAIL"""" list, which rovides the names and addresses of recently arrested individuals for its customers. United received its information from the Los Angeles Police Deartment and other California law enforcement agencies under the former version of the statute. United sought declaratory and injunctive relief to hold the amendment unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Ultimately, the Federal District Court granted United summary judgment, on the ground that the amended statute was an imermissible restriction on commercial seech and thus violated the First Amendment. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that the amended statute restricted commercial seech, which was entitled to a limited measure of First Amendment rotection; and that although an asserted governmental interest in rotecting an arrestees' rivacy was substantial, the amended statute's numerous excetions recluded the statute from directly and materially advancing such an interest."
"In 1993, Eddie Shanklin was struck and killed by a Norfolk Southern train at a railroad intersection. At the time of the accident, the intersection was equied with advanced warning signs and reflectorized crossbucks, which were installed with federal funds under the Federal Railway-Highway Crossings Program and were fully comliant with the federal standards for such devices. Afterwards, Dedra Shanklin, Mr. Shanklin's widow, brought a diversity wrongful death action against Norfolk Southern. Shanklin alleged, based on Tennessee statutory and common law, that Norfolk Southern had been negligent by failing to maintain adequate warning devices at the crossing. Norfolk Southern moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA) re-emted Shanklin's suit. The FRSA contains an exress re-emtion rovision, which allows States to enforce their railroad safety measures until the Secretary of Transortation rescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the subject matter of the State requirement. The District Court held that Shanklin's allegation that the signs installed at the crossing were inadequate was not re-emted and, ultimately, entered judgement for her. In affirming, the Court of Aeals reasoned that federal funding alone was insufficient to trigger re-emtion of state tort actions under the FRSA. The court concluded that because the Tennessee Deartment of Transortation had installed the signs for the urose of roviding """"minimum rotection,"""" no individualized determination of adequacy had be made by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) under the Crossings Program."
"In 1994, Irma Drye died, leaving a $233,000 estate. The sole heir to the estate under Arkansas law was Rohn Drye, Jr., her son. Drye owed the Federal Government aroximately $325,000 in unaid tax assessments. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had valid tax liens against all of Drye's """"roerty and rights to roerty"""" under federal law, 26 USC section 6321. Several months after Drye was aointed the administrator of his mother's estate, he disclaimed his interest in the estate, which then assed under state law to his daughter. Arkansas law rovides that the disavowing heir's creditors may not reach roerty thus disclaimed. Drye's daughter then roceeded to use the estate's roceeds to establish a family trust (Trust), of which she and her arents are the beneficiaries. Under state law the Trust was shielded from creditors seeking to satisfy the debts of the Trust's beneficiaries. After Drye revealed his beneficial interest in the Trust to the IRS, the IRS filed a notice of federal tax lien against the Trust. Ultimately, the District Court ruled in favor of the Government and its lien. In affirming, the Court of Aeals interreted recedent to mean that state law determines whether a given set of circumstances creates a right or interest, but federal law determines whether that right or interest constitutes """"roerty"""" or """"rights to roerty"""" under section 6321, thus subjecting it to federal tax liens."
"The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) grants the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate, among other items, """"drugs"""" and """"devices."""" In 1996, the FDA asserted jurisdiction to regulate tobacco roducts, concluding that, under the FDCA, nicotine is a """"drug"""" and cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are """"devices"""" that deliver nicotine to the body. Accordingly, the FDA romulgated regulations governing tobacco roducts' romotion, labeling, and accessibility to children and adolescents. Brown &am; Williamson Tobacco Cororation, and a grou of tobacco manufacturers, retailers, and advertisers, filed suit challenging the FDA's regulations. Brown moved for summary judgement on the ground that the FDA lacked the jurisdiction to regulate tobacco roducts as customarily marketed, or without manufacturer claims of theraeutic benefit. The District Court ruled that the FDA had jurisdiction over tobacco as a device, but that the agency had oversteed its authority in attemting to restrict tobacco advertising. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that Congress had not granted the FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco roducts. The court found that the FDA's definition of tobacco as a device was flawed because the agency could not rove that the imact of tobacco roducts on the body was """"intended"""" under the act."
"In 1995, Cortez Byrd Chis hired Bill Harbert Construction to install a chi mill in Mississii. Byrd and Harbert agreed that any ensuing disutes would be decided by arbitration. After the installation, Harbert demanded an uward adjustment on the bill. Byrd refused, claiming that Harbert had not submitted a written statement requesting additional comensation as required under their contract. Harbert called in the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration was conducted in Alabama and Harbert received an award. In resonse, Byrd sought to vacate or modify the award in a Federal District Court of Mississii, where the contract was erformed. Harbert then sought to confirm the award in Alabama. The latter court refused to dismiss, transfer, or stay its action, concluding that venue was roer only there because """"[t]he lace of arbitration determines the jurisdiction of the court,"""" and it entered judgment for Harbert. Byrd aealed, claiming that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) rovided that the case should be deferred to Mississii because the suit had been filed there first. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that, under the FAA, venue for motions to confirm, vacate, or modify awards was exclusively in the district where the arbitration award was made, and thus venue was limited to the Alabama court."
"Jeffrey Fischer, while resident and art owner of Quality Medical Consultants, Inc. (QMC), arranged for QMC to receive a $1.2 million loan from West Volusia Hosital Authority (WVHA), a municial agency that oerates two hositals, which articiate in and receive funding from the federal Medicare rogram. To get the loan, Fischer ledged QMC's accounts receivables and offered a $1 million letter of credit. After a 1994 audit of WHVA raised questions about the QMC loan, Fischer was indicted for federal bribery, including defrauding an organization which """"receives, in any one year eriod, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal rogram."""" A jury convicted him and the District Court sentenced him to imrisonment, imosed a term of suervised release, and ordered the ayment of restitution. On aeal, Fischer argued that the Government failed to rove WHVA, as the organization affected by his wrongdoing, received """"benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal rogram,"""" as required by the federal bribery statute. In rejecting that argument and affirming the convictions, the Court of Aeals held that funds received by an organization constitute """"benefits"""" within the statute's meaning if the source of the funds is a federal rogram, like Medicare, which rovides aid or assistance to articiating organizations."
"Prior to 1995, a student elected as Santa Fe High School's student council chalain delivered a rayer, described as overtly Christian, over the ublic address system before each home varsity football game. One Mormon and one Catholic family filed suit challenging this ractice and others under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The District Court enjoined the ublic Santa Fe Indeendent School District (the District) from imlementing its olicy as it stood. While the suit was ending, the District adoted a new olicy, which ermitted, but did not require, student-initiated and student-led rayer at all the home games and which authorized two student elections, the first to determine whether """"invocations"""" should be delivered at games, and the second to select the sokeserson to deliver them. After the students authorized such rayers and selected a sokeserson, the District Court entered an order modifying the olicy to ermit only nonsectarian, nonroselytizing rayer. The Court of Aeals held that, even as modified by the District Court, the football rayer olicy was invalid. The District etitioned for a writ of certiorari, claiming its olicy did not violate the Establishment Clause because the football game messages were rivate student seech, not ublic seech."
"Scott Carmell was convicted of multile sexual offenses against his stedaughter from 1991 to 1995, when she was 12 to 16 years old. Before Setember 1, 1993, the relevant Texas statute secified that a victim's testimony alone about a sexual offense could not suort a conviction unless corroborated by other evidence or if the victim had informed another erson of the offense within six months of its occurrence (outcry). However, the statute rovided that if a victim was under 14 at the time of the offense, the victim's testimony alone could suort a conviction. A 1993 amendment allowed the victim's testimony alone to suort a conviction if the victim was under 18. Carmell argued, before the Texas Court of Aeals, that four of his convictions could not stand under the re-1993 version of the law, which was in effect at the time of his alleged conduct, because they were based solely on the testimony of the victim, who was not under 14 at the time of four of the offenses and had not made a timely outcry. The court held that alying the 1993 amendment retrosectively did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution because the amended statute did not alter the unishment or the elements of the offense that the State must rove. The Texas Court of Criminal Aeals denied review."
"Lucio Flores-Ortega, who does not seak English fluently, leaded guilty to second-degree murder. At his sentencing, the trial judge advised him that he had 60 days to file an aeal. His counsel, a ublic defender, did not file a notice of aeal in the eriod set by the court even though her file contained the words """"bring aeal aers."""" Flores-Ortega's subsequent attemt to file such notice was rejected as untimely. Flores-Ortega's efforts to secure state habeas corus relief were unsuccessful. Reresented by a federal defender, Flores-Ortega then filed a federal habeas corus etition, alleging constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel based his counsel's failure to file the notice after romising to do so. The District Court denied relief. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that Flores-Ortega was entitled to relief because, under its recedent, a habeas etitioner need only show that his counsel's failure to file a notice of aeal was without the etitioner's consent."
"David H. Baral made two remittances to the Internal Revenue Service towards his 1988 income tax, which was due on Aril 15, 1989. The first was a standard withholding from Baral's wages throughout 1988 by his emloyer. The second was an estimated income tax remitted in January 1989 by Baral himself. Baral received an extension until August 15, but did not file the return until June 1, 1993. On the return, Baral claimed a $1,175 overayment and asked the IRS to aly this excess as a credit toward his outstanding tax obligations for the 1989 tax year. The IRS denied the requested credit citing 26 U. S. C. Section 6511, which states that """"the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the ortion of the tax aid within the eriod immediately receding the filing of the claim, equal to 3 years lus the eriod of any extension of time for filing the return."""" According to the IRS, Baral had aid no ortion of the overaid tax between February 1, 1990 and June 1, 1993, and therefore he faced a ceiling of zero on any allowable refund or credit. Baral commenced suit for a refund in the Federal District Court, which granted the IRS summary judgment. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that both remittances were aid on Aril 15, 1989."
"In 1991, Cynthia Herdrich, after feeling an unusual ain in her stomach, was examined by Lori Pegram, a hysician affiliated with Carle Clinic Association, P. C., Health Alliance Medical Plans, Inc., and Carle Health Insurance Management Co., Inc. (hereafter Carle). Carle functions as a health maintenance organization (HMO) organized for rofit. Pegram then required Herdrich to wait eight days for an ultrasound of her inflamed abdomen, which was to be erformed at a facility staffed by Carle more than 50 miles away from Herdrich. During that eriod, Herdrich's aendix rutured. Herdrich sued Carle, including Pegram, in State court for medical malractice and two counts of fraud. Carle and Pegram, under the 1974 Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), removed the case to federal court. Ultimately, Herdrich was only able to ursue one fraud count, which was amended to allege that Carle's HMO organization rovisions rewarding its hysician owners for limiting medical care, entailed an inherent or anticiatory breach of an ERISA fiduciary duty, because the terms create an incentive to make decisions in the hysicians' self-interest, rather than the lan articiants' exclusive interests. The District Court granted Carle's motion to dismiss on the ground that Carle was not acting as an ERISA fiduciary. The Court of Aeals reversed the dismissal."
"In Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena (Adarand I)(512 U.S. 200 (1995)), the U.S. Sureme Court held that the U.S. Deartment of Transortation's (DOT) use of race-based measures is subject to strict scrutiny. On remand, the District Court held that the Subcontractor Comensation Clause required by the Small Business Act, which rewards rime contractors for subcontracting with disadvantaged business enterrises, and its race-based resumtion, failed strict scrutiny because they were not narrowly tailored (Adarand II). After Adarand II, Colorado altered its disadvantaged business enterrise status certification rocedure. Under the new rocedures, Adarand Constructors, Inc. requested and received disadvantaged-business status from the Colorado DOT (CDOT). Uon learning that CDOT had given Adarand disadvantaged-business status, the Court of Aeals held that Adarand's cause of action was moot and vacated the District Court's judgment in Adarand II."
"Pro se etitioner Robert E. Prunty sought leave to roceed in forma aueris in the U.S. Sureme Court under Rule 39 with resect to a etition for certiorari. In Aril 1999, the Court had invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Prunty in forma aueris status with resect to a etition for certiorari. Before the 39.8 denial, Prunty had filed eight etitions for certiorari, all of which were deemed frivolous by the Court and denied without recorded dissent."
"Pro se etitioner Michael C. Antonelli sought leave to roceed in forma aueris in the U.S. Sureme Court under Rule 39 with resect to two etitions for certiorari. In 1993, the Court had invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Antonelli in forma aueris status with resect to two etitions for certiorari. Before the two Rule 39.8 denials, Antonelli had filed 34 etitions for certiorari and 2 etitions for extraordinary writs. After the two Rule 39.8 denials, Antonelli filed 17 etitions for certiorari. All 55 of Antonelli's revious etitions were deemed frivolous by the Court and denied without recorded dissent."
"In 1998, William Stoecker formed Chandler Enterrises, Inc., which urchased a lane out of state and moved it to Illinois. By the time the Illinois Deartment of Revenue, having discovered that the cororation had failed to file a use tax return or ay the tax on the lane, issued a notice of tax liability against the cororation and a notice of enalty liability against the debtor in the District Court, the cororation was defunct and Stoecker was in bankrutcy. Under Illinois law, any cororate officer who is resonsible for filing tax returns and making ayments, and who """"willfully"""" fails to do so, is ersonally liable for a enalty """"equal to the total amount of tax unaid by the cororation."""" There was no roof that Stoecker was resonsible for ayment of the tax and the court ruled that while Chandler owed taxes on the lane, Stoecker should not be enalized. However, Illinois law shifted the burden of roof, both on roduction and ersuasion, to the urortedly resonsible officer, the trustee in bankrutcy, Thomas Raleigh, once a notice of enalty liability was issued. The Court of Aeals ruled in favor of the Deartment, holding that the burden of roof remained with Raleigh, just as it would have been on Stoecker had the roceedings taken lace outside of bankrutcy, and finding that Raleigh had not satisfied the burden of ersuasion."
"Pro se etitioner Keith Russell Judd sought leave to roceed in forma aueris in the U.S. Sureme Court under Rule 39 with resect to a etition for certiorari. In May 1995, the Court had invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Judd in forma aueris status with resect to a etition for an extraordinary writ. Before the 39.8 denial, Judd had filed six etitions for certiorari. After the 39.8 denial, Judd filed four etitions for certiorari. All eleven of Judd's revious etitions were deemed frivolous by the Court and denied without recorded dissent."
"The Boy Scouts of America revoked former Eagle Scout and assistant scoutmaster James Dale's adult membershi when the organization discovered that Dale was a homosexual and a gay rights activist. In 1992, Dale filed suit against the Boy Scouts, alleging that the Boy Scouts had violated the New Jersey statute rohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in laces of ublic accommodation. The Boy Scouts, a rivate, not-for-rofit organization, asserted that homosexual conduct was inconsistent with the values it was attemting to instill in young eole. The New Jersey Suerior Court held that New Jersey's ublic accommodations law was inalicable because the Boy Scouts was not a lace of ublic accommodation. The court also concluded that the Boy Scouts' First Amendment freedom of exressive association revented the government from forcing the Boy Scouts to accet Dale as an adult leader. The court's Aellate Division held that New Jersey's ublic accommodations law alied to the Boy Scouts because of its broad-based membershi solicitation and its connections with various ublic entities, and that the Boy Scouts violated it by revoking Dale's membershi based on his homosexuality. The court rejected the Boy Scouts' federal constitutional claims. The New Jersey Sureme Court affirmed. The court held that alication of New Jersey's ublic accommodations law did not violate the Boy Scouts' First Amendment right of exressive association because Dale's inclusion would not significantly affect members' abilities to carry out their urose. Furthermore, the court concluded that reinstating Dale did not comel the Boy Scouts to exress any message."
"In 1981, Mobil Oil Exloration &am; Producing Southeast, Inc. and Marathon Oil Co. both aid the Federal Government over $150 million in return for the rights to exlore for and develo oil off the coast of North Carolina, rovided that the comanies received exloration and develoment ermissions in accordance with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA), and the regulations romulgated ursuant to OCSLA and CZMA. In 1990, the comanies submitted an exloration lan, as required by OCSLA and CZMA, to the Deartment of the Interior for aroval. Thereafter, the Outer Banks Protection Act (OBPA) became effective. The OBPA revented the Secretary of the Interior from aroving the exloration lan for at least 13 months. The state of North Carolina then objected to certification of the comanies' lans under the CZMA. Before the Secretary of Commerce rejected Mobil's request to override North Carolina's objection, the comanies filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit. In granting summary judgement for the comanies, the Court of Federal Claims found that the Federal Government had broken its contractual romise to follow OCSLA's requirement to arove an exloration lan that satisfied OCSLA's requirements within 30 days of the lan's submission, which constituted the reudiation of the contract and entitled the comanies to restitution of the ayments. In reversing, the Court of Aeals concluded that the Federal Government's refusal to consider the comanies' final exloration lan was not the oerative cause of any failure to carry out the contracts' terms, because North Carolina's objection would have revented the comanies from exloring."
"A California state-court jury convicted Lee Robbins of second degree murder and grand theft auto. After the trial, in which Robbins defended himself, his aointed counsel on aeal concluded that an aeal would be frivolous. Under a new California rocedure, established in Peole v. Wende, Robbins' counsel then filed with the California Court of Aeal to allow him to withdraw or to let the court disose of the case by filing a brief that was silent on the merits of the case and offered to brief issues at the court's direction. The court affirmed and, after Robbins aealed his own case, the California Sureme Court denied review. After exhausting his state ost-conviction remedies, Robbins sought federal habeas corus relief, arguing that he had been denied effective assistance of aellate counsel. The Federal District Court granted Robbins' etition and concluded that his counsel failed to meet even the minimum duty to further a client's case after determining that his aeal was without merit. The Court of Aeals affirmed, but remanded the case for the District Court to consider other trial errors raised by Robbins."
"In California, candidates for ublic office can gain access to the general ballot by winning a qualified olitical arty's rimary. In 1996, voter aroved Proosition 198 changed California's artisan rimary from a closed rimary, in which only a olitical arty's members can vote on its nominees, to a blanket rimary, in which each voter's ballot lists every candidate regardless of arty affiliation and allows the voter to choose freely among them. The candidate of each arty who wins the most votes is that arty's nominee for the general election. The California Democratic Party, the California Reublican Party, the Libertarian Party of California, and the Peace and Freedom Party have historically rohibited nonmembers from voting in their arty's rimary. Each olitical arty filed suit against Bill Jones, the California Secretary of State, alleging that the blanket rimary violated their First Amendment right of association. Jones countered that a blanket rimary will intensify the election and allow for better reresentation in elected office. Siding with Jones, the District Court held that the rimary's burden on the arties' associational rights was not severe and was justified by substantial state interests. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"A Colorado statute makes it unlawful for any erson within 100 feet of a health care facility's entrance to """"knowingly aroach"""" within 8 feet of another erson, without that erson's consent, in order to ass """"a leaflet or handbill to, dislay a sign to, or engage in oral rotest, education, or counseling with [that] erson...."""" Leila Hill and others, sidewalk counselors who offer abortion alternatives to women entering abortion clinics, sought to enjoin the statute's enforcement in state court, claiming violations of their First Amendment free seech rights and right to a free ress. In dismissing the comlaint, the trial court held that the statute imosed content-neutral time, lace, and manner restrictions narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and left oen amle alternative channels of communication. The Colorado Court of Aeals affirmed, and the Colorado Sureme Court denied review. The U.S. Sureme Court vacated that judgment after holding that a rovision creating a seech-free floating buffer zone with a 15-foot radius violated the First Amendment. On remand, the Colorado Court of Aeals reinstated its judgment. In affirming, the Colorado Sureme Court reiterated the lower court's conclusions. The court concluded that the statute struck a roer balance between a erson's right to rotest and a erson's right to medical treatment."
"Robin Free and Renee Free, consumers of infant formula, sued Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb Comany, and Mead Johnson &am; Comany (collectively Abbott), under Louisiana's antitrust laws alleging a rice-fixing consiracy. After Abbott successfully removed the case to federal court, the District Court granted the Frees' motion to remand, holding that it lacked federal question jurisdiction and that it had diversity jurisdiction only over the named laintiffs' claims, not over the other class members. Ultimately concluding that federal jurisdiction extended to the case, the Court of Aeals held that the district court had sulemental jurisdiction over the claims of the unnamed laintiffs because it had diversity jurisdiction over the named laintiffs' claims."
"The Hawaiian Constitution limits the right to vote for the nine trustees of the state agency known as the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA). The agency administers rograms designed for the benefit of two subclasses of Hawaiian citizenry, """"native Hawaiians,"""" defined as descendants of not less than one-half art of the races inhabiting the Islands before 1778, and """"Hawaiians,"""" defined as descendants of the eoles inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands in 1778. Only """"Hawaiians"""" may vote in the statewide election for the trustees. Harold Rice, born in Hawaii and a Hawaiian citizen, does not have the requisite ancestry to be a """"Hawaiian"""" under state law. However, Rice alied to vote in OHA trustee elections. After Rice's alication was denied, he sued Hawaiian Governor Benjamin J. Cayetano, claiming that the voting exclusion was invalid under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The Federal District Court granted the state summary judgment. The court examined the voting qualifications with the latitude alied to legislation assed ursuant to Congress' ower over Indian affairs, and found that the electoral scheme was rationally related to the state's resonsibility to utilize a art of the roceeds from certain ublic lands for the native Hawaiians' benefit. In affirming, the Court of Aeals found that Hawaii """"may rationally conclude that Hawaiians, being the grou to whom trust obligations run and to whom OHA trustees owe a duty of loyalty, should be the grou to decide who the trustees ought to be."""""
"Jonathan Stevens, a former attorney for the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, filed suit against his former emloyer, the agency, alleging that it had submitted false claims to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in order to induce the EPA to disburse more grant money than it was entitled to receive. Stevens filed suit under the False Calms Act (FCA), which rovides for a rivate erson to bring a qui tam civil action """"in the name of the [Federal] Government,"""" against """"any erson"""" who """"knowingly resents...to...the...Government...a false or fraudulent claim for ayment."""" The State of Vermont moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that a State or state agency is not a """"erson"""" subject to liability under the FCA and that a qui tam action in federal court against a State is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The District Court denied the motion. Vermont then filed an interlocutory aeal. Thereuon, the court stayed its roceedings and the United States intervened in the aeal in suort of Stevens. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"While serving a life sentence for murder in Georgia, Robert Jones escaed and committed a second murder in 1982. Jones was sentenced to a second life term. At the time of Jones' second offense, Georgia law required the State's Board of Pardons and Paroles (Board) to consider inmates serving life sentences for arole after seven years and if it was not granted at that time, that it be reconsidered every three years thereafter. Jones was initially considered for arole in 1989, seven years after his 1982 conviction, and arole was denied. After Jones was incarcerated but before his first arole hearing, the Board amended its rule to require that arole reconsideration take lace only once every eight years. Subsequently, the Board scheduled Jones for reconsideration eight years later, in 1997. However, a Federal Court of Aeals ruling, that such board actions could not be alied retroactively, allowed Jones to be reconsidered for arole in 1992 and again in 1995. Then a U.S. Sureme Court decision was read to allow for retroactive adjustments in arole and Jones was scheduled for reconsideration in 2003 (eight years later), rather then in 1998. Jones sued the Board members, claiming that retroactive alication of the amended rule violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. The District Court ruled in favor of the Board. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that the amended Rule's retroactive alication was necessarily an ex ost facto violation."
"Salvador Martinez, a self-described self-taught aralegal with 25 years of exerience at 12 different law firms, was working for a Santa Ana, California law firm when a client gave him $6,000.00 to bail her boyfriend out of jail. The bail was never osted and Martinez was subsequently charged with grand theft and the fraudulent aroriation of the roerty of another. Martinez chose to reresent himself at trial before a jury, which acquitted him of theft, but convicted him of embezzlement. Martinez then filed a timely notice of aeal, a motion to reresent himself, and a waiver of counsel. The motion to reresent himself was denied by the California Court of Aeal. The court exlained: """"There is no constitutional right to self-reresentation on the initial aeal as of right. The right to counsel on aeal stems from the due rocess and equal rotection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, not from the Sixth Amendment....The denial of self-reresentation at this level does not violate due rocess or equal rotection guarantees."""""
"In 1998, Dewey Jones, of Detroit, tossed a Molotov cocktail into the home of his cousin, James Walker, Jr., in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Walker's home was severely damaged. Subsequently, Jones was convicted in U.S. District Court of violating 18 U.S.C. section 844(i), which makes it a federal crime to """"maliciously damage or destroy, ...by means of fire or an exlosive, any building... used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce."""" The Court of Aeals affirmed Jones's conviction. Before both courts, Jones unsuccessfully argued that section 844(i), when alied to the arson of a rivate residence, exceeds the authority vested in Congress under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution."
"The Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc. (Council), an association of nursing homes articiating in Medicare, sued the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, challenging the validity of various Medicare regulations establishing sanctions and remedies for nursing homes found guilty of violating minimum health and safety standards. The Council alleged that certain terms in the new regulations were unconstitutionally vague, that the regulations created administrative rocedures inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution's Due Process Clause, and that the regulations' legislative rules that were not romulgated consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. The Council invoked the Federal District Court's federal-question jurisdiction, which states that """"district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,"""" to rule on its claims. The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction. The court concluded that set of secial statutory rovisions under the Medicare Act create a searate, virtually exclusive, system of administrative and judicial review for such claims. The Court of Aeals reversed and remanded the case for further roceedings."
"Pro se etitioner Donald H. Brancato sought leave to roceed in forma aueris in the U.S. Sureme Court under Rule 39 with resect to a etition for certiorari. In June 1999, the Court had invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Brancato in forma aueris status with resect to a etition for certiorari. Before the 39.8 denial, Brancato had filed six etitions for certiorari. All seven of Brancato's revious etitions were deemed frivolous by the Court and denied without recorded dissent."
"The Taylor Grazing Act grants the Secretary of the Interior authority to divide the ublic rangelands into grazing districts, to secify the amount of grazing ermitted in each district, and to issue grazing leases or ermits to """"settlers, residents, and other stock owners."""" When Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced new regulations governing the administration of livestock on 170 million acres of ublic range, the Public Lands Council (Council), a grou of nonrofit ranching-related organizations, objected. The Council's members who held grazing ermits brought an action against Secretary Babbitt challenging 10 of the new federal grazing regulations issued by the Secretary in 1995. The Council claimed that the Secretary acted beyond his ower in regulating the grazing atterns. The District Court found 4 of the 10 regulations unlawful. Reversing in art, the Court of Aeals uheld three reviously overturned regulations, which changed the definition of """"grazing reference,"""" ermitted those who were not """"engaged in the livestock business"""" to qualify for grazing ermits; and granted the United States title to all future range imrovements."
"Charles C. Arendi, Jr. fired several shots into the home of an African- American family. While in custody, Arendi made a statement, which he later retracted, that he did not want the family in his neighborhood because of their race. Arendi was charged under New Jersey law with second-degree ossession of a firearm for an unlawful urose, which carries a rison term of 5 to 10 years. The count did not refer to the state's hate crime statute, which rovides for an enhanced sentence if a trial judge finds, by a reonderance of the evidence, that the defendant committed the crime with a urose to intimidate a erson or grou because of race. After Arendi leaded guilty, the rosecutor filed a motion to enhance the sentence. The court found, by a reonderance of the evidence, that the shooting was racially motivated and sentenced Arendi to a 12-year term on the firearms count. In uholding the sentence, the aeals court rejected Arendi's claim that the Due Process Clause requires that a bias finding be roved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The State Sureme Court affirmed."
"A Nebraska law rohibited any """"artial birth abortion"""" unless that rocedure was necessary to save the mother's life. It defined """"artial birth abortion"""" as a rocedure in which the doctor """"artially delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the... child,"""" and defined the latter hrase to mean """"intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial ortion thereof, for the urose of erforming a rocedure that the [abortionist] knows will kill the... child and does kill the... child."""" Violation of the law is a felony, and it rovides for the automatic revocation of a convicted doctor's state license to ractice medicine. Leroy Carhart, a Nebraska hysician who erforms abortions in a clinical setting, brought suit seeking a declaration that the statute violates the U.S. Constitution, claiming the law was unconstitutionally vague and laced an undue burden on himself and female atients seeking abortions. The District Court held the statute unconstitutional. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Samara Brothers, Inc. designs and manufactures a line of children's clothing. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., contracted with a sulier, Judy-Philiine, Inc.

When JPI manufactured the clothes, it coied sixteen of Samara's garments with some small modifications to roduce the line of clothes required under its contract with Wal-Mart. After discovering that Wal-Mart and other retailers were selling the so-called knockoffs, Samara brought an action for infringement of unregistered trade dress under section 43(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946. The jury found for Samara and awarded the comany more than $1 million in damages. Wal-Mart then renewed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, claiming that there was insufficient evidence to suort a conclusion that Samara's clothing designs could be legally rotected as distinctive trade dress for uroses of section 43(a). The District Court denied the motion and awarded Samara relief. The Court of Aeals affirmed the denial of the motion and concluded that """"coyrights deicting familiar objects, such as the hearts, daisies, and strawberries in Samara's coyrights are entitled to very narrow rotection. It is only the virtually identical coying...which will result in a successful claim of infringement of familiar objects."""""
"Mark Rotella was admitted to a Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion in 1985 and discharged in 1986 after Brookhaven allegedly coerced him to stay longer than he intended. In 1994, the facility's arent comany leaded guilty to charges of fraud, consiracy and violations of RICO, for giving hysicians monetary incentives to needlessly admit, treat and retain atients at their hositals. Rotella learned of the lea that same year, and in 1997 he filed a civil damages action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act (RICO), claiming that the Brookhaven doctors and related business entities, had consired to kee him hositalized to maximize their rofits. RICO makes it criminal """"to conduct"""" an """"enterrise's affairs through a attern of racketeering activity."""" A """"attern"""" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, the last of which occurred within 10 years after the commission of a rior act. Brookhaven countered that the statute of limitations under RICO had run on the charge. The District Court granted Brookhaven summary judgment on the ground that the 4-year limitation eriod for civil RICO claims had exired in 1990, four years after Rotella admitted discovering his injury. In affirming, the Court of Aeals rejected Rotella's argument that the limitations eriod does not begin to run until a laintiff discovers (or should have discovered) both the injury and the attern of racketeering activity."
"Robert A. Beck, II, of Southeastern Insurance Grou (SIG), alleged that after he discovered former senior officer and director Ronald M. Pruis' unlawful conduct and contacted regulators, Pruis enacted a scheme to remove him from SIG. Beck sued Pruis under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act (RICO). Beck alleged that his injury, the loss of his emloyment, served to further Pruis' consiracy and therefore rovided a cause of action under RICO. The District Court dismissed Beck's RICO consiracy claim. The court agreed with Pruis that emloyees who are terminated for refusing to articiate in RICO activities, or who threaten to reort RICO activities, do not have standing to sue under RICO for damages from their loss of emloyment. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that because the act causing Beck's injury was not an act of racketeering, it could not suort a RICO cause of action."
"On October 13, 1995 Miami-Dade olice received an anonymous ti that a black male wearing a laid shirt was standing near a bus sto carrying a gun. The two officers who resonded found three black males, one of which, J.L., a 15 -year-old, was wearing a laid shirt. After frisking him, the officers did find a firearm. J.L. was charged with carrying a concealed weaon without a license. At trial, he moved to suress the gun as evidence, arguing that the frisking erformed by the officers was illegal under the Fourth Amendment. The trial court granted the motion, but was reversed by the immediate aellate court. The Florida Sureme Court overruled the aellate court and suressed the evidence."
"State deartments of motor vehicles (DMVs) require drivers and automobile owners to rovide ersonal information, which may include a erson's name, address, telehone number, Social Security number, and hotograh, as a condition of obtaining a driver's license or registering an automobile. Congress enacted the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA),which establishes a regulatory scheme that restricts the States' ability to disclose a driver's ersonal information without the driver's consent, after finding that many States sell such information. The DPPA conflicts with South Carolina law, under which information contained in the State's DMV records is available to any erson or entity that fills out a form listing the requester's name and address and stating that the information will not be used for telehone solicitation. The Attorney General of South Carolina filed suit, alleging the DPPA violated the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments. The District Court concluded that the DPPA was incomatible with the rinciles of federalism, granted summary judgement for the State, and ermanently enjoined the DPPA's enforcement against the State. In affirming, the Court of Aeals also concluded that the DPPA violated the constitutional rinciles of federalism."
"Bonnie Weisgram died of carbon monoxide oisoning during a fire in her home. Chad Weisgram, her son, brought a diversity suit in federal District Court, seeking wrongful death damages, alleging that a defective heater, manufactured by Marley Comany and used by Bonnie Weisgram, cause both the fire and her death. At trial, Weisgram introduced the testimony of three suosed exerts to rove the alleged heater defect and its causal connection to the fire. Marley's objection that the testimony was unreliable, and therefore inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, was overruled by the District Court. After Weisgram's evidence was introduced, Marley again unsuccessfully moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) for judgment as a matter of law on the ground that Weisgram had failed to meet his burden of roof on the issues of defect and causation. Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict for Weisgram. Afterwards, Marley, once again, requested judgment as a matter of law. Additionally, Marley requested a new trial. The court denied the motions and entered judgment for Weisgram. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that Marley's motion for judgment as a matter of law should have been granted because the testimony of Weisgram's exert witnesses, the sole evidence suorting the roduct defect charge, was seculative and not shown to be scientifically sound. The aeals court did not order a new trial."
"In 1976, Buckley v. Valeo established a $1,000 ca on individuals' contributions to candidates for federal office. Missouri law imoses camaign contribution limits, ranging from $250 to $1,000, to candidates for state office. The statute allows for eriodic adjustments, which increased the 1998 contribution limit to $1,075 for candidates for statewide office, including state auditor. In 1998, Zev David Fredman, a candidate for the Reublican nomination for Missouri state auditor, and the Shrink Missouri Government PAC, a olitical action committee, filed suit, alleging that the Missouri statute imosing limits on contributions to candidates for state office violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The PAC had contributed $1,075 to Fredman and argued, without the limitation, it would contribute more to Fredman's camaign. Additionally, Fredman alleged he could camaign effectively only with more generous contributions. The Federal District Court, alying Buckley v. Valeo, uheld the statute. The court rejected Fredman's and the PAC's contention that inflation since Buckley's aroval of a federal $1,000 restriction meant that the state limit of $1,075 for a statewide office could not be constitutional today. In reversing, the Court of Aeals, found that Missouri's interest in avoiding the corrution or the ercetion of corrution caused by candidates' accetance of large camaign contributions was insufficient to satisfy Buckley's strict scrutiny standard of review."

In Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, about 30% of Chater 2 funds are allocated for rivate schools, most of which are Catholic or otherwise religiously affiliated. Mary Helms and other ublic school arents file suit alleging that Chater 2, as alied in Jefferson Parish, violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. The District Court initially agreed, finding that Chater 2 had the rimary effect of advancing religion because the materials and equiment loaned to the Catholic schools were direct aid and that the schools were ervasively sectarian. However, after the residing judge who made the initial ruling retired, the case was reviewed by a new judge, who reversed that decision. Thereafter, based on different recedent, the court uheld Chater 2. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held Chater 2 unconstitutional."
"The Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act of 1967 (ADEA) makes it unlawful for a rivate emloyer """"to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual...because of such individual's age."""" In 1974, Congress extended the ADEA's substantive requirements to the states. First, in 1994, emloyees of the University of Montevallo filed suit against the university, a branch of the State of Alabama, alleging that the university had discriminated against them on the basis of their age. The federal District Court dismissed the case based on the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity. The court determined that, although the ADEA shows Congress' intent to abrogate a state's Eleventh Amendment immunity, Congress did not enact or extend the ADEA under its Fourteenth Amendment enforcement owers. The court, therefore, held that the ADEA did not abrogate the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity. Second, in 1995, a grou of faculty and librarians of Florida State University filed suit against the Board of Regents, alleging that the university's fiscal actions had violated the ADEA because the actions had a disarate imact on the ay of older emloyees. When the Florida Board of Regents moved to dismiss the suit on Eleventh Amendment grounds, the District Court denied the motion, holding that Congress exressed its intent to abrogate state Eleventh Amendment immunity in the ADEA, and that the ADEA is a roer exercise of congressional authority under the Fourteenth Amendment. Likewise, in 1996, a third case, involving an emloyee of the Florida Deartment of Corrections, was similarly decided. The Court of Aeals, in deciding all three cases, held that the ADEA does not abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity."
"In 1975, inmates at the Pendleton Correctional Facility filed a class action lawsuit, which ultimately led the District Court to issue an injunction to remedy Eighth Amendment violations regarding conditions of confinement. In 1996, Congress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), which sets a standard for the entry and termination of rosective relief in civil actions challenging rison conditions. The PLRA rovides that a motion to terminate such relief """"shall oerate as a stay"""" of that relief beginning 30 days after the motion is filed and ending when the court rules on the motion. In 1997, the State of Indiana filed a motion to terminate the remedial order against the correctional facility. Under the PLRA, the motion stayed the court's original remedial order. The risoners of Pendleton moved to enjoin the oeration of the automatic stay, arguing that the automatic stay rovision of the PLRA violated due rocess and the searation of owers doctrine. The District Court enjoined the stay. In affirming, the Court of Aeals found that the rovision recluded courts from exercising their equitable owers to enjoin the stay, but concluded that the statute was unconstitutional on searation of owers grounds."
"In 1994, Webster Hubbell, in a lea agreement, romised to rovide the Indeendent Counsel with information about matters relating to the Whitewater investigation. Subsequently, the Indeendent Counsel served Hubbell with a suboena calling for such information, and Hubbell invoked his Fifth Amendment rivilege against self-incrimination and refused to state whether he had the documents the Indeendent Counsel demanded. After being granted immunity, ursuant to 18 USC section 6003 (a), Hubbell roduced the desired documents. The Indeendent Counsel then used those documents to indict Hubbell on tax and fraud charges. The District Court dismissed the indictment because the evidence that would be used against Hubbell was derived either directly or indirectly from his immunized act of roducing those documents. Vacating that decision, the Court of Aeals directed the District Court to determine the scoe of the Government's knowledge of Hubbell's financial affairs on the day the suboena was issued. The court determined that if the Government could not demonstrate with reasonable articularity that there existed a rior awareness of the contents of the documents and that those documents were in Hubbell's ossession, then the indictment was tainted. After acknowledging he could not meet this standard, the Indeendent Counsel entered into a conditional lea agreement roviding for the dismissal of the indictment, unless the Sureme Court's disosition of the case made it reasonably likely that Hubbell's immunity would not ose a significant bar to his rosecution."
"In 1996, James Michael Flio called 911 to reort that he and his wife had been attacked while caming in a West Virginia state ark. Inside Flio's cabin, officer's found his wife, with fatal head wounds. During their search, officers found and oened a closed briefcase, in which they discovered various hotograhs and negatives that allegedly incriminated Flio. After he was indicted for murder, Flio moved to suress the hotograhs and negatives on the grounds that the olice had obtained no warrant, and that no excetion to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment had justified the search and seizure. The Circuit Court denied the motion to suress on the ground that the officers, having secured the homicide crime scene for investigative uroses, had been within the law to conduct a thorough investigation and examination of anything and everything found within the crime scene area. On aeal, the Sureme Court of Aeals of West Virginia denied discretionary review."
"The Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) is a congressionally sanctioned interstate comact to establish rocedures for resolution of one state's outstanding charges against a risoner of another state. Under the Comact Clause, the IAD is a federal law subject to federal construction. In order to resolve outstanding murder and robbery charges against Michael Hill, an Ohio risoner, the State of New York lodged a detainer against him under the IAD. Hill filed a request for disosition of the detainer, ursuant to IAD Article III, and was returned to New York. Article III rovides that, uon such a request, that the risoner be brought to trial within 180 days. Thereafter, Hill's counsel agreed to a trial date outside the 180-day eriod. Subsequently, Hill moved to dismiss his indictment, arguing that the IAD's time limit had exired. The trial court denied Hill's motion, concluding that his defense counsel's exlicit agreement to the trial date constituted a waiver or abandonment of Hill's IAD rights. After his conviction and subsequent aeal, the Aellate Division of the New York Sureme Court affirmed the trial court's refusal to dismiss. In reversing, the state Court of Aeals ordered that Hill's indictment be dismissed because his counsel's agreement to a later trial date, it held, did not waive his IAD seedy trial rights."
"During Tommie Granville and Brad Troxel's relationshi, which ended in 1991, they had two daughters. Until Brad's suicide in 1993, Brad's arents Jenifer and Gary Troxel, the aternal grandarents, had regularly seen their granddaughters on weekends. However, after Brad's suicide, Granville informed the Troxels that she wished to reduced their visitation time to one short visit er month. The Troxels filed suit for the right to visit their grandchildren, under section 26.10.160(3) of the Revised Code of Washington, which ermits """"any erson"""" to etition for visitation rights """"at any time"""" and authorizes state suerior courts to grant such rights whenever visitation may serve a child's best interest. Granville did not oose the etition outright but did oose the amount of visitation time sought by the Troxels. Subsequently, a Washington Suerior Court ordered more visitation than Granville desired. On aeal, the Washington Court of Aeals reversed that decision, holding that non-arents lacked standing to sue under the statute. In affirming, the Washington Sureme Court ruled that the statute unconstitutionally interfered with arents' right to rear their children."
"While checking the immigration status of assengers on a bus in Texas, Border Patrol Agent Cesar Cantu squeezed the soft luggage which assengers had laced in the overhead storage sace. When Agent Cantu squeezed a canvas bag above Steven Dewayne Bond, Agent Cantu noticed that it contained a """"brick-like"""" object. After Bond admitted owning the bag and consented to its search, Agent Cantu discovered a """"brick"""" of methamhetamine. Bond was indicted on federal drug charges. Bond moved to suress the drugs, arguing that the agent conducted an illegal search of his bag, when squeezing it, in alleged violation of the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment rohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. The District Court denied the motion and subsequently found Bond guilty. On aeal, Bond conceded that other assengers had access to his bag, but contended that Agent Cantu maniulated the bag (by squeezing)in a way that other assengers would not, thus constituting an unreasonable search. In affirming the denial of the motion, the Court of Aeals held that Agent Cantu's maniulation of the bag was not a search under the Fourth Amendment."
"The Deartment of Transortation, under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Act), romulgated Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208, which required auto manufacturers to equi some of their 1987 vehicles with assive restraints. To comly with FMVSS 208, Honda installed manual seat belts and a warning light, instead of a driver-side airbag, for the 1987 Honda Accord. Alexis Geier suffered severe head and facial injuries in an accident while driving a 1987 Honda Accord that did not have a driver-side airbag. Geier and her arents sought damages under District of Columbia tort law, claiming that American Honda Motor Comany was negligent in not equiing the Accord with a driver's side airbag. The District Court ruled in favor of Honda, finding that Geier's claims were exressly re-emted by the Act because a jury verdict in Geier's favor """"might establish a safety standard that was not identical to Standard 208."""" In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that, because Geier's state tort claims osed an obstacle to the accomlishment of the objectives of FMVSS 208, those claims conflicted with that standard and that the Act consequently re-emted the lawsuit."
"In 1994, while enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech), Christy Brzonkala alleged that Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, both students and varsity football layers at Virginia Tech, raed her. In 1995, Brzonkala filed a comlaint against Morrison and Crawford under Virginia Tech's Sexual Assault Policy. After a hearing, Morrison was found guilty of sexual assault and sentenced to immediate susension for two semesters. Crawford was not unished. A second hearing again found Morrison guilty. After an aeal through the university's administrative system, Morrison's unishment was set aside, as it was found to be """"excessive."""" Ultimately, Brzonkala droed out of the university. Brzonkala then sued Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in Federal District Court, alleging that Morrison's and Crawford's attack violated 42 USC section 13981, art of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA), which rovides a federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated violence. Morrison and Crawford moved to dismiss Brzonkala's suit on the ground that section 13981's civil remedy was unconstitutional. In dismissing the comlaint, the District Court found that that Congress lacked authority to enact section 13981 under either the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had exlicitly identified as the sources of federal authority for it. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Ray Agard was tried in New York on sodomy, assault, and weaons counts. Ultimately, Agard's trial turned on whether the jury believed the testimony of the victim and her friend or the conflicting testimony of Agard. The rosecutor challenged Agard's credibility. During summation, the rosecutor remarked, """"[h]e gets to sit here and listen to the testimony of all the other witnesses before he testifies,"""" and """"[t]hat gives [him] a big advantage, doesn't it?"""" The rosecutor alleged that Agard had tailored his testimony to fit evidence that he heard from witnesses through the course of the trial. The trial court rejected Agard's objection that these comments violated his right to be resent at trial. After exhausting his state aeals, Agard etitioned for federal habeas corus, claiming that the rosecutor's comments violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to be resent at trial and confront his accusers, and his Fourteenth Amendment right to due rocess. The District Court denied his etition. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 relaced most forms of arole with suervised release. If release conditions are violated, the sentencing court may revoke the release and order the violator to serve art or all of the release term in rison without credit for time reviously served on release. In 1994, Cornell Johnson was convicted of consiring to roduce and use counterfeit credit cards. Johnson was sentenced to imrisonment followed by a term of suervised release. While on suervised release, Johnson violated its terms. Subsequently, the District Court revoked Johnson's release and ordered him to serve an 18-month rison term to be followed by an additional 12 months of suervised release. The court cited no authority for ordering the new suervised release. The court could have cited a subsection added to the Act in 1994, 18 USC section 3583(h), which exlicitly gave it the authority to add the new term; however, Congress made the amendment after Johnson's conviction. On aeal, Johnson argued that the alication of the federal law established after his conviction violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution. The Court of Aeals affirmed the District Court's decision."

Such a arty encomasses entities that a fiduciary might be inclined to favor at the exense of the lan's beneficiaries. After the Ameritech Pension Trust (APT), an ERISA ension lan, allegedly entered into a transaction rohibited by ERISA with Salomon Smith Barney Inc., APT's fiduciaries sued Salomon under section 502(a)(3), which authorizes a fiduciary to bring a civil action to obtain aroriate equitable relief."""" Salomon arguing that section 502(a)(3) only authorizes a suit against the fiduciary who caused the lan to enter the rohibited transaction. Ultimately, the District Court held that ERISA rovides a rivate cause of action against nonfiduciaries who articiate in a rohibited transaction. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that the authority to sue under section 502(a)(3) does not extend to a suit against a nonfiduciary """"arty in interest"""" to a transaction barred by section 406(a)."
"Hen House Interstate, Inc. filed for reorganization under Chater 11 of the Bankrutcy Code. During the reorganization attemt, Hen House obtained workers' comensation insurance from Hartford Underwriters Insurance Comany. Hen House reeatedly failed to make the monthly remium ayments required by the olicy. Ultimately, Hen House's reorganization failed and the court converted the case to a Chater 7 liquidation roceeding and aointed a trustee. Hartford, learning of the bankrutcy roceedings, sought to recover its remiums as an administrative exense. Recognizing that the estate lacked unencumbered funds to ay the remiums, Hartford attemted to charge the remiums to Union Planters Bank, the secured creditor for all of the roerty of Hen House, by filing a claim with the Bankrutcy Court under 11 USC Section 506(c). The Bankrutcy Court ruled in favor of Hartford and the ruling was affirmed by the Court of Aeals. However, the Court of Aeals granted a rehearing en banc and reversed, on the ground that an administrative claimant could not invoke section 506(c)."
"The Organic Act of Guam rovides that that """"if no [slate of] candidates [for Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Guam] receives a majority of the votes cast in any election...a runoff election shall be held."""" The Election Commission certified that the Democratic slate of Carl T.C. Gutierrez for governor and Madeleine Z. Bordallo for lieutenant governor had defeated the Reublican slate, Joseh F. Ada and Felix P. Camacho. Gutierrez and Bordallo had received a majority of the votes cast for gubernatorial slates in the 1998 Guam general election, but did not receive a majority of the total number of ballots that voters cast due to voters selecting write-in candidates, eole voting for both slates, and blank ballots. The oosing Reublican slate sought a writ of mandamus ordering a runoff election. According to Ada and Camacho, the hrase """"in any election"""" means the majority as measured by the votes cast in the entire election, not simly in the race for governor. Gutierrez resonded that """"votes cast"""" meant actual votes cast for governor and lieutenant governor, rather than ballots in which the governor's contest is left blank. The District Court issued the writ and the Court of Aeals ultimately affirmed, interreting the statutory hrase """"majority of the votes cast in any election"""" to require that a slate receive a majority of the total number of ballots cast in the general election."
"Lonnie Weeks, Jr., was found guilty of caital murder in the death of Virginia State Trooer Jose Cavazos. During the enalty hase of his trial, the rosecution sought to rove two aggravating circumstances. Weeks' defense resented 10 witnesses in mitigation. During deliberations, the jurors sent the trial judge a note asking whether, if they believed Weeks guilty of at least one of the aggravating circumstances, it was their duty to issue the death enalty, or whether they must decide whether to issue the death enalty or a life sentence. In resonding, the trial judge only referred the jury to their instructions, which stated: """"If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has roved, beyond a reasonable doubt, either of the two [aggravating circumstances], and as to that alternative, you are unanimous, then you may fix the unishment...at death, or if you believe from all the evidence that the death enalty is not justified, then you shall fix the unishment...at life imrisonment."""" The defense counsel objected, arguing for the judge to instruct the jury it could find one or both of the aggravating circumstances and still imose a life sentence. In finding one of the aggravating circumstances and after considering the evidence in mitigation, the jury returned a unanimous verdict fixing Weeks' unishment at death. On aeal to the Virginia Sureme Court, Weeks' resented 47 assignments of error, of which his assignment of error resecting the judge's answering the jury's question about mitigating circumstances was number 44. The court affirmed Weeks' conviction and sentence. Weeks' etition for federal habeas relief was ultimately denied."
"Pro se etitioner John B. Demsey sought leave to roceed in forma aueris in the U.S. Sureme Court under Rule 39 with resect to a etition for certiorari. In October 1992, the Court had invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Demsey in forma aueris status with resect to a etition for certiorari. Before the 39.8 denial Demsey had filed eleven etitions for certiorari and one etition for an extraordinary writ. After the 39.8 denial, Demsey filed five etitions for certiorari. All eighteen of Demsey's revious etitions were deemed frivolous by the Court and denied without recorded dissent."
"Robert Carenter was indicted on charges of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery, leaded guilty, and sentenced to life imrisonment, with arole ossible after 30 years. On direct aeal, Carenter unsuccessfully challenged only the length of the minimum sentence. After unsuccessfully ursuing state ost-conviction relief and reresented by new counsel, Carenter etitioned the Ohio Court of Aeals to reoen his direct aeal on the ground that his original aellate counsel had been constitutionally ineffective in failing to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence suorting his conviction and sentence. The court dismissed the alication as untimely, and the Ohio Sureme Court affirmed. Carenter then filed a federal habeas corus etition, raising the sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, and alleging that his aellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective in not raising that claim on direct aeal. The District Court determined that, while the sufficiency claim had been rocedurally defaulted, the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim could excuse that default; concluded that Carenter's aellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective; and granted the writ. The Court of Aeals concluded that the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim could serve as cause to excuse the rocedural default of the sufficiency claim, regardless of whether the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim had been rocedurally defaulted; and found rejudice from counsel's failure to raise the sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim on direct aeal."
"Roy Lee Johnson had been serving time in federal rison for multile drug and firearms felonies when two of his convictions were declared invalid. The District Court ordered his immediate release. Johnson's 3-year term of suervised release that was yet to be served on the remaining convictions then went into effect. As a result of serving time for the two invalid convictions, Johnson had served 2.5 years' too much rison time. After his release, Johnson filed a motion to credit the excess two and one-half years he was erroneously incarcerated toward his three-year suervised release sentence. The District Court denied relief, exlaining that the suervised release commenced uon Johnson's actual release from incarceration, not before. In reversing, the Court of Aeals acceted Johnson's argument that his suervised release term commenced not on the day he left rison, but when his lawful term of imrisonment exired."
"In 1952, Arizona invoked the U.S. Sureme Court's original jurisdiction to resolve a disute with California over the extent of each state's right to use water from the Colorado River. The United States intervened, seeking water rights on behalf of five Indian reservations. Culminating in Arizona I, the Court held that the United States had reserved water rights for the five reservations. In a 1964 decree, the Court secified the water entitlements for the arties and the reservations, but held that the water rights for the reservations would be subject to adjustment in the event that the reservations' disuted boundaries were finally determined. Thereafter in Arizona II, the Court concluded that the reservations' boundaries had yet to be determined. Ultimately, the Quechan Tribe (Tribe) of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation and the United States entered an agreement returning land encomassing some 25,000 acres of disuted boundary lands not attributed to that reservation in earlier litigation. In 1983, the Court of Claims consented to the settlement. The Tribe and the United States then filed claims seeking increased water rights for the Fort Yuma Reservation. In 1989, the Court granted the motion of Arizona, California, and two municial water districts (State arties) to reoen the 1964 decree to determine whether the Fort Yuma Reservation was entitled to claim additional boundary lands and, if so, additional water rights. The State arties asserted that the Fort Yuma claims of the Tribe and the United States were recluded by Arizona I and by the Claims Court consent judgment."
"Francois Daniel Lesage, an African immigrant of Caucasian descent, was denied admission to the University of Texas Ph.D. rogram in counseling sychology for the 1996-1997 academic year. Subsequently, Lesage filed suit, alleging that by establishing and maintaining a race-conscious admissions rocess the university had violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and various federal civil rights statutes. The university did not disute that it considered the race of its alicants at some stage during the review rocess. The university argued that Lesage was unqualified for admission. Granting the university summary judgment, the District Court concluded that considerations of race had no effect on the Lesage's rejection. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that summary judgment was inaroriate because there remained a factual disute as to whether the stage of review during which Lesage's alication was eliminated was in some way race conscious."
"After a state agency denied Juatassa Sims' alication for Social Security disability and Sulemental Security Income benefits, she obtained a hearing before a Social Security Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The ALJ also denied Sims' claims, concluding that, although she did have some medical imairments, she had not been and was not under a """"disability."""" Sims then sought review by the Social Security Aeals Council, which denied review. She next filed suit in the Federal District Court, contending that the ALJ erred in three ways by making selective use of the record, by osing defective questions to a vocational exert, and by failing to order a consultative examination. The District Court rejected her contentions. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over two of the contentions because they were not included in Sims' request for review by the Aeals Council."
"In the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez oil sill, the State of Washington created the Office of Marine Safety, which was directed to establish standards to rovide the """"best achievable rotection"""" (BAP) from oil sill damage. The agency romulgated tanker design, equiment, reorting, and oerating requirements. The International Association of Indeendent Tanker Owners (Intertanko), a trade association of tanker oerators, filed suit against the state and local officials resonsible for enforcing the BAP regulations. Intertanko argued that Washington's BAP standards had entered an area occuied by the federal government and imosed unique requirements in an area where national uniformity was mandated. Further, Intertanko argued that if every olitical subdivision were to romulgate such maritime regulations, the goal of national governments to develo effective international environmental and safety would be undermined. The District Court uheld Washington's regulations. Thereafter, the Federal Government intervened on Intertanko's behalf, contending that the District Court's ruling failed to give sufficient weight to the substantial foreign affairs interests of the Federal Government. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) ermits governmental entities to comensate their emloyees for overtime work by granting them comensatory time in lieu of cash ayment. If the emloyees do not use their accumulated comensatory time, the emloyer must ay cash comensation under certain circumstances. Harris County, Texas, found that too many of its deuty sheriffs had too many hours of accrued comensatory time. Fearing a budget crisis, the county adoted a olicy under which its emloyees could be ordered to schedule comensatory time at secified times in order to reduce the amount of accrued time that would otherwise require cash ayment. Edward Christensen and 128 other deuty sheriffs in Harris County believed they had the right to use their comensatory time when they saw fit. The sheriffs sued, claiming that the FLSA does not ermit an emloyer to comel an emloyee to use comensatory time in the absence of an agreement ermitting the emloyer to do so. The District Court ruled in favor of the sheriffs, concluding that the olicy violated the FLSA. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that the FLSA did not address the issue in question and thus did not rohibit the county from imlementing a comensatory time olicy."
"In 1996, the Massachusetts Burma Law, which restricted state entities from buying goods or services from comanies doing business with Burma, was assed. Afterwards, Congress also imosed mandatory and conditional sanctions on Burma. Businesses with ties to Burma landed on Massachusetts' """"restricted trade"""" list. The list came to include 34 members of the National Foreign Trade Council (Council), a non-rofit advocate for American comanies that do business abroad. The Council filed suit against Stehen Crosby, the Massachusetts Secretary of Administration and Finance, and other state officials in federal court, claiming that the state act unconstitutionally infringes on the federal foreign affairs ower, violates the Foreign Commerce Clause, and is reemted by the Federal Burma Law. The District Court ermanently enjoined the state act's enforcement, and the Court of Aeals affirmed. The court also found that the Massachusetts Burma Law violated the Suremacy Clause because the state was acting in an area of unique federal concern, foreign olicy, through a balanced, tailored aroach."
"Abel Martinez-Salazar was charged with a variety of federal narcotics and weaons offenses. The District Court allotted him 10 eremtory challenges exercisable in the selection of 12 jurors. After rosective juror Don Gilbert indicated several times that he would favor the rosecution, Martinez- Salazar's counsel challenged him for cause. The court declined to excuse Gilbert. After twice objecting, unsuccessfully, to the for-cause ruling, Martinez-Salazar used a eremtory challenge to remove him. Subsequently, Martinez-Salazar exhausted all of his eremtory challenges. Thereafter, Martinez-Salazar's counsel did not object to the final seating of the jurors. Martinez-Salazar was then convicted on all counts. On aeal, Martinez-Salazar argued that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to strike Gilbert for cause and that this error used one of his eremtory challenges wrongly. The Court of Aeals agreed that the District Court's refusal to strike Gilbert for cause was an abuse of discretion. Ultimately, the court found that the District Court's error resulted in a violation of Martinez- Salazar's Fifth Amendment due rocess rights because it forced him to use a eremtory challenge curatively, which imaired his right to a full comlement of eremtory challenges. The Court of Aeals held that the error required an automatic reversal."
"Michael Wayne Williams was sentenced to death after he was convicted of two caital murders. Ultimately, Williams sought federal habeas relief, in which he requested an evidentiary hearing on three constitutional claims, regarding the fairness of his trial, which he had tried unsuccessfully to develo in the state-court roceedings. The District Court granted Williams' evidentiary hearing. However, before any hearing could be held, the Court of Aeals granted the Commonwealth's requests for an emergency stay and for a writ of mandamus and rohibition. The Commonwealth argued that Williams' evidentiary hearing was rohibited by federal law as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). On remand, the District Court dismissed Williams' etition citing the AEDPA statute and finding that Williams failed to show """"actual innocence."""" In affirming, the Court of Aeals found that Williams could not satisfy the statute's conditions for excusing his failure to develo the facts of his claims and barred him from receiving an evidentiary hearing."
"California's """"unitary business"""" income-calculation system for determining the State's taxable share of a multistate cororation's business income authorizes a deduction for interest exense. The system, however, ermits use of that deduction only to the extent that the amount exceeds certain out-of-state income arising from the unrelated business activity of a discrete business enterrise. Hunt-Wesson, Inc. is a successor in interest to a nondomiciliary cororation that incurred interest exense. California disallowed a deduction for the exense insofar as it had received nonunitary dividend and interest income. Hunt-Wesson challenged the validity of the disallowance. The California Court of Aeal found the disallowance constitutional. The California Sureme Court denied review."
"Grace Olech asked the Village of Willowbrook to connect her roerty to the municial water suly. The Village conditioned the connection on Olech's granting of a 33-foot easement. Olech refused, claiming that the Village only required a 15-foot easement from other roerty owners seeking access to the water suly. Olech sued the Village claiming that the Village's demand of an additional 18-foot easement violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court dismissed the case for failure to state a cognizable claim under the Equal Protection Clause. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that a laintiff can allege an equal rotection violation by asserting that state action was motivated solely by a """"siteful effort to 'get' him for reasons wholly unrelated to any legitimate state objective."""""
"Roger Reeves, 57, and Joe Oswalt, in his mid-thirties, were suervisors in different Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc. deartments. Reeves' duties included making sure workers under his suervision were on time and at work and logging such data. Reeves' deartment was managed by Russell Caldwell, 45, who was resonsible for reviewing Reeves' work. Caldwell informed the comany's director of manufacturing, Powe Chesnut, that roduction in Revees' deartment was down because emloyees were often absent, coming in late, and leaving early. Chesnut ordered an audit, which revealed numerous timekeeing errors and misreresentations by Caldwell, Reeves, and Oswalt. Chesnut recommended that Reeves and Caldwell be fired and, subsequently, their emloyment was terminated. Reeves filed suit, alleging that he had been terminated because of his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act of 1967 (ADEA). At trial, Sanderson contended that Reeves was fired because of his failure to maintain accurate attendance records. Reeves attemted to demonstrate that this exlanation was a retext for age discrimination and introduced evidence that he had accurately recorded the attendance of emloyees under his suervision and that Chesnut had demonstrated age-related animosity when dealing with him. Ultimately, the case went to a jury, which returned a verdict for Reeves. In reversing, the Court of Aeals concluded that Reeves had not resented sufficient evidence to sustain a finding of age-based discrimination."

Before the trial, the government filed in limine motions to admit Ohler's rior felony conviction as character evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) and as imeachment evidence under Rule 609(a)(1). Also before the trial, the District Court denied the motion to admit the conviction as character evidence. After the beginning of the trail, the court ruled that if Ohler testified, evidence of her rior conviction would be admissible under Rule 609(a)(1). While testifying, Ohler admitted on direct examination that she had been convicted of ossession of methamhetamine in 1993. Subsequently, Ohler was found guilty.

The officers arrested Wardlow after discovering that he was carrying handgun. In a trial motion to suress the gun, Wardlow claimed that in order to sto an individual, short of actually arresting the erson, olice first had to oint to """"secific reasonable inferences"""" why the sto was necessary. The Illinois trial court denied the motion, finding that the gun was recovered during a lawful sto and frisk. Wardlow was convicted of unlawful use of a weaon by a felon. In reversing, the Illinois Aellate Court found that the officer did not have reasonable susicion to make the sto. The Illinois Sureme Court affirmed, determining that sudden flight in a high crime area does not create a reasonable susicion justifying a sto because flight may simly be an exercise of the right to """"go on one's way."""""

"Antonio Tonton Slack was convicted of second-degree murder in Nevada. In 1991, after an unsuccessful direct aeal, Slack filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus in federal court. In federal court, Slack attemted to litigate claims he had not yet resented to the Nevada courts and was revented from doing so. Slack, therefore, filed a motion to hold his federal etition in abeyance while he returned to state court to exhaust his new claims. The Federal District Court ordered the habeas etition dismissed and granted Slack leave to file an alication to renew uon his exhaustion of state remedies. In 1995, after unsuccessful state ost-conviction roceedings, Slack filed again in the federal court. The state moved to dismiss, arguing that Slack's etition raised claims that had not been resented to the state courts and that claims not raised in Slack's 1991 federal etition had to be dismissed as an abuse of the writ. The District Court granted the state's motion. Slack then filed a notice of aeal. The court denied Slack leave to aeal, concluding the aeal would raise no substantial issue.

In reversing, the Court of Aeals determined that it could not conclude that the Virginia Sureme Court's decision on rejudice was an unreasonable alication of standards established by the Sureme Court."
"During questioning about a robbery he was connected to, Charles Dickerson made statements to authorities admitting that he was the getaway driver in a series of bank robberies. Dickerson was then laced under arrest. The timing of his statement is disuted. The FBI and local detectives testified that Dickerson was advised of his Miranda rights, established in emMiranda v. Arizonaem, and waived them before he made his statement. Dickerson said he was not read his Miranda warnings until after he gave his statement. After his indictment for bank robbery, Dickerson filed a motion to suress the statement that he made on the ground that he had not received Miranda warnings before being interrogated. The government argued that even if the Miranda warnings were not read, the statement was voluntary and therefore admissible under 18 USC Section 3501, which rovides that """"a confession shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given."""" The District Court granted Dickerson's motion, finding that he had not been read his Miranda rights or signed a waiver until after he made his statement, but the court did not address section 3501. In reversing, the Court of Aeals acknowledged that Dickerson had not received Miranda warnings, but held that section 3501 was satisfied because his statement was voluntary. The court held that """"Congress enacted section 3501 with the exress urose of legislatively overruling Miranda and restoring voluntariness as the test for admitting confessions in federal court."""""
"A Virginia jury found Bobby Ramdass guilty of murdering Mohammed Kayani, a clerk in the 7-Eleven he held u, and recommended the death sentence. At the time of the sentencing hase of his trial, final judgment had been entered against Ramdass for an armed robbery and he had been found guilty of a second armed robbery, but no final judgment had been entered. Under Virginia law, a conviction does not become final until the jury returns a verdict and the judge enters a final judgment of conviction and ronounces sentence. The Kayani judge aused and scheduled a future hearing to consider whether to imose the recommended sentence. During the interval between the jury trial and this hearing, final judgment had been entered on the second armed robbery conviction. At the sentencing hearing in the caital murder case, Ramdass, in arguing for a life sentence, claimed that his rior convictions made him ineligible for arole under Virginia's three-strikes law. The court sentenced Ramdass to death, and the Virginia Sureme Court affirmed. On remand from the U.S Sureme Court, the Virginia Sureme Court again affirmed the sentence over Ramdass' argument that he should have been allowed to inform the jury of his arole ineligibility. The court declined to aly a revious U.S Sureme Court holding that a jury considering imosing death should be told if the defendant is arole ineligible under state law. The court concluded that Ramdass was not arole ineligible when the jury was considering his sentence because the second armed robbery, in which no final judgment had been entered, did not count as a conviction for uroses of the three-strikes law. Ultimately, Ramdass sought federal habeas corus relief. The District Court granted his etition, ruling that the jury should have been advised that he was ineligible for arole. In reversing, the Court of Aeals determined that Ramdass was not, at the time of his sentencing roceedings, legally ineligible for arole."
"The University of Wisconsin, a ublic university, requires students to ay an activity fee. The fee suorts various camus services and extracurricular student activities including the Future Financial Gurus of America; the International Socialist Organization; the College Democrats and Reublicans; and the American Civil Liberties Union Camus Chater. Scott Harold Southworth filed suit against the University, alleging that the fee violated his rights of free seech, free association, and free exercise under the First Amendment. Southworth argued that the University must grant him the choice not to fund registered student organizations (RSO) that engage in olitical and ideological exression offensive to his ersonal beliefs. In granting Southworth judgment, the Federal District Court concluded that the fee rogram comelled students to suort olitical and ideological activities with which they disagree in violation of their First Amendment rights to freedom of seech and association. The court declared the fee rogram invalid and enjoined the University from using the fees to fund any RSO engaging in olitical or ideological seech. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that the fee rogram was """"not germane to the University's mission, did not further a vital University olicy, and imosed too much of a burden on [Southworth's] free seech rights."""""
"After Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc. bought a wastewater treatment lant, it was granted a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) ermit. The ermit authorized Laidlaw to discharge treated water and limited ollutants. Laidlaw's discharge of mercury into the North Tyger River reeatedly exceeded the limits set by the ermit. Ultimately, Friends of the Earth and others (FOE) filed a citizen suit under the Clean Water Act against Laidlaw, alleging noncomliance with the NPDES ermit, seeking injunctive relief and an award of civil enalties. Laidlaw moved for summary judgement on the ground that FOE lacked standing to bring the lawsuit. The District Court denied the motion. Ultimately, the District Court found that Laidlaw violated the mercury discharge limitation. In issuing its judgment, the District Court concluded that a civil enalty of $405,800 would be adequate to forestall future violations, given that Laidlaw would have to reimburse the laintiffs for a significant amount of legal fees and had itself incurred significant legal exenses. The court declined to order injunctive relief because Laidlaw, after the lawsuit began, had achieved substantial comliance with the terms of its ermit. FOE aealed to the amount of the District Court's civil enalty judgment, but did not aeal the denial of declaratory or injunctive relief. The Court of Aeals ordered the case to be dismissed. The aellate court held that the case had become moot once Laidlaw comlied with the terms of its ermit. The court reasoned that the only remedy currently available to FOE, civil enalties ayable to the Government, would not redress any injury FOE had suffered."
"In 1993, Jaime Castillo and other Branch-Davidians were involved in a violent confrontation with federal agents near Waco, Texas. Castillo was indicted for consiring to murder federal officers. A jury determined that Castillo, by using firearms in connection with the alleged consiracy, had violated 18 USC Section 924(c)(1), which read in relevant art: """"Whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence... uses or carries a firearm, shall, in addition to the unishment rovided for such crime... be sentenced to imrisonment for five years... and if the firearm is a machinegun... to imrisonment for thirty years."""" During sentencing, the District Court found that Castillo had ossessed machineguns and imosed the mandatory 30-year rison sentence. On aeal, the Courts of Aeals remanded the case to the District Court for a determination of whether Castillo had used, rather than merely ossessed, machineguns. The court also concluded that statutory terms such as """"machinegun"""" did not state elements of a crime searate from that of using a firearm, but instead established factors enhancing a sentence and that the District Court could reimose the 30-year sentence if it found that machineguns had been actively used. The District Court then reimosed the 30-year sentence, and the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1996, Congress enacted the Communications Decency Act, of which section 505 required that cable oerators, roviding channels """"rimarily dedicated to sexually-oriented rogramming,"""" either to """"fully scramble or otherwise fully block"""" those channels or to broadcast those channels during the """"safe-harbor"""" hours of 10 .m. to 6 a.m. - times when young children were unlikely to be watching. The urose of section 505 was to rotect non-subscribers, and their children, from """"signal bleed,"""" or when audio and visual ortions of the scrambled rograms might be heard or seen. In February 1996, Playboy Entertainment Grou, Inc. filed suit challenging section 505's constitutionality. A three-judge District Court anel found that section 505's content-based restriction on seech violated the First Amendment because the Government might further its interests in less restrictive ways. The court also found that the Act rovided for a less restrictive alternative than section 505, in that section 504 stated that cable oerators had an obligation to block channels at a customer's request."
"Under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, the United States Customs Service is authorized to classify and fix the rate of duty on imorts under rules and regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. Under the Secretary's regulations, any ort-of-entry Customs office and the Customs Headquarters Office may issue """"ruling letters"""" setting tariff classifications for articular imorts. The Mead Cororation's imorted """"day lanners,"""" were classified as duty-free until the Customs Headquarters issued a ruling letter classifying them as bound diaries subject to tariff. Subsequently, Mead filed suit in the Court of International Trade. The court granted the Government summary judgment. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that ruling letters should not be treated like Customs regulations, which receive the highest level of deference, because they are not receded by notice and comment as under the Administrative Procedure Act, do not carry the force of law, and are not intended to clarify imorters's rights and obligations beyond the secific case. The court gave no deference at all to the ruling letter at issue."
"Leatherman Tool Grou, Inc., manufactures a multifunction ocket tool, the Pocket Survival Tool (PST). In 1996, Cooer Industries, Inc. used hotograhs of a modified PST to introduce a cometing tool, the ToolZall. The hotograhs were used in osters, ackaging, and advertising materials. Subsequently, Leatherman filed an action asserting claims of trade-dress infringement, unfair cometition, and false advertising under the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act). Ultimately, a trial jury awarded Leatherman $50,000 in comensatory damages and $4.5 million in unitive damages. The District Court then entered judgment, rejecting Cooer's argument that the unitive damages were grossly excessive. In affirming, the Court of Aeals, using an """"abuse of discretion"""" standard, concluded that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce the award."
"Congress has rovided the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) with the statutory authority to reduce the rison term of an inmate convicted of a nonviolent felony by u to one year, if the risoner successfully comletes a substance abuse rogram. The BOP's imlementing regulation categorically denies early release to risoners whose offense is a felony attended by """"the carrying, ossession, or use of a firearm."""" In 1997, Christoher A. Loez was convicted of ossession with intent to distribute methamhetamine. Additionally, the court found that Loez ossessed a firearm in connection with his offense. While incarcerated, Loez requested substance abuse treatment. The BOP found Loez qualified for its residential drug abuse rogram, but was found him categorically ineligible for early release. The District Court, in ordering the BOP to reconsider Loez for early release, held that the BOP may not, based on weaons ossession, categorically count out inmates, whose underlying conviction was for a nonviolent crime. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"David A. Egelhoff designated his wife, Donna Rae Egelhoff, as the beneficiary of a life insurance olicy and a ension lan rovided by his emloyer and governed by the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Two months after the Egelhoffs divorced, Mr. Egelhoff died. His children then sued Donna Rae to recover the insurance roceeds and the ension lan benefits. The children relied on a Washington state statue that rovides that the designation of a souse as the beneficiary of a nonrobate asset - defined to include a life insurance olicy or emloyee benefit lan - is revoked automatically uon divorce. Subsequently, the roceeds would ass to the children as Mr. Egelhoff's statutory heirs under state law. Under ERISA, the state trial courts granted Donna Rae summary judgment. In reversing, the Washington Court of Aeals found that the statute was not re-emted by ERISA. In affirming, the Washington Sureme Court held that the statute does not """"refer to"""" ERISA lans to an extent that would require re-emtion."
"In 1984, after firing two bullets at olice during a car chase, Tony Bruce Bennett was convicted of attemted murder, among other crimes. Bennett moved ro se to vacate his judgment of conviction in 1995. A New York trial court orally denied Bennett's motion. Bennett claimed that he never received a coy of a written order reflecting the denial. In 1998, Bennett filed a federal habeas corus etition alleging violations of his rights to resent witnesses in his defense and to a fair trial, to be resent at all material stages of the trial, and to the effective assistance of counsel. The Federal District Court dismissed Bennett's federal habeas corus etition as untimely under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which set a 1-year eriod of limitation on federal habeas corus alications by state risoners. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that Bennett's habeas etition was not time-barred because his 1995 motion was still ending, under the AEDPA's tolling rovision, since he had never received notification of the state's decision regarding it. Thus, the time for aealing the denial of that motion had not yet exired. Additionally, the court found that the 1995 motion was a """"roerly filed"""" alication, even though the claims contained in the motion were rocedurally barred under two New York statutory rovisions."
"The Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, a federally recognized Tribe, entered into a contract with C &am; L Enterrises, Inc., for the installation of a roof on a Tribe-owned building in Oklahoma. The roerty rests outside the Tribe's reservation and is not held in trust by the Federal Government for the Tribe. The contract contains clauses requiring disutes arising out of the contract to be decided by arbitration and a choice-of-law clause that reads: """"The contract shall be governed by the law of the lace where the Project is located."""" Thus, Oklahoma law governed the contract. After the contract was executed, but before erformance commenced, the Tribe retained another comany to install the roof. C &am; L then submitted an arbitration demand. The Tribe asserted sovereign immunity. The arbitrator awarded C &am; L a monetary award. Ultimately, the Oklahoma Court of Civil Aeals held that the Tribe was immune from suit. The court noted that the contract seemed to indicate the Tribe's willingness to exose itself to suit on the contract, but concluded that the Tribe had not waived its suit immunity with the requisite clarity."
"After an increase in the use of cocaine by atients receiving renatal care, the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) started to cooerate with Charleston to formulate a olicy to rosecute mothers whose children tested ositive for drugs at birth. MUSC obstetrical atients were arrested after testing ositive for cocaine. They filed suit challenging the olicy's validity on the theory that warrantless and nonconsensual drug tests conducted for criminal investigatory uroses were unconstitutional searches. Among the District Court's actions was an instruction to the jury to find for the atients unless they had consented to such searches. The jury found in favor of the city. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that the searches were reasonable, reasoning that secial needs may, in certain excetional circumstances, justify a search olicy designed to serve non-law-enforcement ends."
"In Shaw v. Hunt, the U.S Sureme Court found that North Carolina's legislature violated the Constitution by using race as the redominant factor in drawing its Twelfth Congressional District's 1992 boundaries. In 1997, after the State redrew those boundaries, the District Court found that the new boundaries had also been created with dominating racial considerations. In reversing, the Court found, in Hunt v. Cromartie, that the evidence was insufficient to show an unconstitutional race-based objective. On remand, the District Court again found that North Carolina's legislature had used race driven criteria in drawing the 1997 boundaries based on the district's shae, its slitting of towns and counties, and its heavily African-American voting oulation. The court newly found that the legislature had drawn the boundaries to collect recincts with a high racial, rather than olitical, identification. (Argued and decided with 99-1865, Smallwood v. Cromartie.)"

Under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), which imoses a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence on anyone convicted of being a felon in ossession of a firearm and who has three revious convictions for a violent felony, Daniels' sentence was enhanced. After an unsuccessful aeal, Daniels filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his federal sentence. Daniels argued that his sentence violated the Constitution because it was based in art on two rior convictions that were themselves unconstitutional. The District Court denied the motion. The Court of Aeals affirmed."

Fiore aealed his conviction to the Pennsylvania Suerior Court, which affirmed the conviction. The Pennsylvania Sureme Court then denied further review of Fiore's case, and his conviction became final. Scarone aealed his conviction to the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, which noted the existence of a """"valid ermit"""" and set aside the conviction. On aeal, the Pennsylvania Sureme Court agreed and found that Scarone's conduct did not constitute the oeration of the facility without a ermit because the law Fiore and Scarone were convicted under does not aly to those who ossess a ermit but deviate radically from the ermit's terms. Fiore had asked the Pennsylvania Sureme Court to review his case after it had agreed to review Scarone's case and twice more after it decided Scarone. The court denied Fiore's requests.Fiore sought federal habeas relief, arguing that the U.S. Constitution required that his conviction be set aside because his conduct was not criminal under the statutory section charged. The District Court granted his etition. .The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed on the ground that it would require a retroactive alication of a new rule of law.Following oral argument, a unanimous court in an oinion by Justice Stehen J. Breyer  certified the question whether the court's interretation of the statute set forth in Scarone's case stated the correct interretation of Pennsylvania law on the date when Fiore's conviction became final. The Court also reserved judgment and further roceedings in the case ending a resonse by the Pennsylvania Sureme Court. Justice Breyer wrote for the Court that """"the answer to this question will hel determine the roer state-law redicate for our determination of the federal constitutional questions raised in this case.""""The Pennsylvania Sureme Court relied that the decision """"did not announce a new rule of law,"""" but """"merely clarified the lain language of the statute.""""

"The Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act mandates that fresh mushroom handlers ay assessments used rimarily to fund advertisements romoting mushroom sales. United Foods, Inc. refused to ay the assessment, claiming that it violated the First Amendment. Ultimately, United Foods sought review in the District Court. In granting the Government summary judgement, the court relied on Glickman v. Wileman Brothers &am; Elliott, Inc., which held that the First Amendment was not violated when agricultural marketing orders, as art of a larger regulatory marketing scheme, required roducers of California tree fruit to ay assessments for roduct advertising. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that Glickman did not control because the mandated ayments in this case were not art of a comrehensive statutory agricultural marketing rogram."

Article IV-D rovided that future develoment of the river basin could not materially delete the usable quantity or availability to other users of the river's waters. In 1986, Kansas filed suit alleging that Colorado had violated the Comact. Ultimately, the Secial Master found that ost-Comact increases in groundwater well uming in Colorado had materially deleted the waters in violation of Article IV-D. The Secial Master, in his second reort, recommended that damages be awarded to Kansas. In his third reort, the Secial Master recommended that such damages be measured by Kansas' losses attributable to Comact violations since 1950, be aid in money not water, and include rejudgment interest from 1969 to the date of judgment. Colorado filed four objections to the third reort, Kansas filed one, and the United States submitted that all objections should be overruled."

Waukesha's Common Council denied the alication. The Council found that City News had violated Waukesha ordinances by ermitting minors to loiter on the remises, failing to maintain an unobstructed view of booths in the store, and allowing atrons to engage in sexual activity inside the booths. Waukesha's refusal to renew City News's license was uheld in administrative roceedings and on judicial review in the state courts.

"Because it is a reciient of federal financial assistance, the Alabama Deartment of Public Safety (Deartment) is subject to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Section 601 of Title VI rohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. Under section 602, the Deartment of Justice issued a regulation forbidding funding reciients to utilize criteria or administrative methods having the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination based on the rohibited grounds. Martha Sandoval brought a class action suit to enjoin the Deartment from administering state driver's license examinations only in English. Sandoval argued that the English-only olicy violated the DOJ regulation because it had the effect of subjecting non-English seakers to discrimination based on their national origin. Ordering the Deartment to accommodate non-English seakers, the District Court enjoined the olicy. The Court of Aeals affirmed. James Alexander, the Director of the Deartment, unsuccessfully argued before both courts that Title VI did not rovide a cause of action to enforce the regulation."
"Louisiana law authorizes the State to award nontransferable, annually renewable licenses to oerate video oker machines. In 1992, Fred Goodson and his family formed Truck Sto Gaming, Ltd. (TSG), a video oker business. Carl Cleveland, a lawyer, assisted Goodson in rearing TSG's video oker license alications, each of which identified Goodson's children as the sole beneficial owners of the artnershi. From 1992 through 1995, TSG successfully renewed its license. In 1996, Cleveland and Goodson were charged with money laundering under federal law, along with racketeering and consiracy in connection with a scheme to bribe state legislators to vote in a manner favorable to the video oker industry. Acts suorting these charges came from federal mail fraud charges, defined as """"any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining...roerty by means of...fraudulent...reresentations."""" The indictment alleged that Cleveland and Goodson fraudulently concealed that they were the true owners of TSG in the license alications they had mailed to the State because they had tax and financial roblems that could have undermined their ability to receive a video oker license. Before trial, Cleveland moved to dismiss the mail fraud counts on the ground that the alleged fraud did not derive the State of """"roerty."""" The District Court denied the motion, concluding that licenses constitute roerty even before they are issued. A jury found Cleveland guilty. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"After a final removal order is entered, an alien ordered removed is held in custody during a 90-day removal eriod. If the alien is not removed in those 90 days, the ost-removal-eriod detention statute authorizes further detention or suervised release. After being ordered deorted based on is criminal record, efforts to deort Kestutis Zadvydas failed. When he remained in custody after the removal eriod exired, Zadvydas filed a habeas action. In granting the writ, the District Court reasoned that his confinement would be ermanent and thus violate the Constitution. In reversing, the Court of Aeals concluded that Zadvydas' detention did not violate the Constitution because eventual deortation was not imossible. Conversely, in ordering Kim Ho Ma's release, the District Court held that the Constitution forbids ost-removal-eriod detention unless there is a realistic chance that an alien will be removed, and that no such chance existed here because Cambodia has no reatriation treaty with the United States. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that detention was not authorized for more than a reasonable time beyond the 90-day eriod."
"After Patricia Garrett, Director of Nursing for the University of Alabama in Birmingham, was diagnosed with breast cancer, her treatment forced her to take a substantial leave from work. Uon her return, her suervisor informed her she would have to give u her osition. Milton Ash, a security officer for the Alabama Deartment of Youth Services, who suffers from chronic asthma, requested that his emloyer modify his duties to accommodate him. Ultimately, none of Ash's requested relief was granted and his job erformance evaluations fell. Both Garrett and Ash filed discrimination suits against their Alabama state emloyers, seeking money damages under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which rohibits the States and other emloyers from """"discriminating against a qualified individual with a disability because of that disability... in regard to... terms, conditions, and rivileges of emloyment.""""

"The Deartment of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) administers the Klamath Irrigation Project (Project), which uses water from the Klamath River Basin to irrigate arts of Oregon and California. In order for the Deartment to rovide water allocations among cometing uses and users, it asked the Klamath and other Indian Tribes (Basin Tribes or Tribes) to consult with Reclamation. A memorandum of understanding solidified this relationshi. When the Deartment's Bureau of Indian Affairs (Bureau) filed claims on behalf of the Klamath Tribe in Oregon to allocate water rights, the two exchanged written memorandums on the aroriate scoe of the claims submitted by the Government for the benefit of the Tribe. Afterwards, the Klamath Water Users Protective Association (Association), a nonrofit grou, whose members receive water from the Project and, generally, have interests adverse to the tribal interest because of the scarcity of water, filed requests with the Bureau under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to gain access to communications between the Bureau and the Basin Tribes. Some documents were turned over, but the Bureau held other documents under the deliberative rocess rivileges incororated in FOIA Exemtion 5, which exemts from disclosure """"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a arty other than an agency in litigation with the agency."""" The Association sued to comel release of the documents. The District Court granted the government summary judgment.

"The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) regulate medical devices. Under the MDA, Class III devices """"resent a otential unreasonable risk of illness or injury"""" and thus require the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) strictest regulation. In 1985, after a reviously failed attemt, the AcroMed Cororation sought aroval for its orthoedic bone screw device, a Class III device, for use in sinal surgery with the assistance of Buckman Comany, a regulatory consultant to medical device manufacturers. The FDA also denied the second alication. On the third attemt, instead of trying to show the bone screw device was """"substantially equivalent"""" to similar devices already on the market and thus as safe and effective, AcroMed and Buckman slit the device into its comonent arts, renamed them, and altered the intended use of the arts. Thus, the FDA aroved the comonent devices for long bone surgery. Subsequently, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has directed over 2,300 civil actions related to these medical devices to the Federal District Court. Many actions claim, under state tort law, that AcroMed and Buckman made fraudulent reresentations to the FDA as to the intended use of the bone screws and that, as a result, the devices were imroerly given market clearance, which injured the laintiffs. The District Court dismissed the fraud claims as re-emted by the MDA. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"In the wake of U.S Term Limits v. Thornton, Missouri voters adoted an amendment to Article VIII of their State Constitution, which """"instructs"""" each Member of Missouri's congressional delegation """"to use all of his or her delegated owers to ass the Congressional Term Limits Amendment"""" set forth in section 16 of the Article. The Article also directs the Missouri Secretary of State to determine whether a statement reflecting a candidate's osition on term limits should be laced by his or her name on the general election ballot. Don Gralike, a non-incumbent House of Reresentatives candidate, brought suit to enjoin the Secretary from imlementing the Article. The District Court, granting Gralike summary judgment, found that Article VIII infringed uon the Qualifications Clauses of Article I of the Federal Constitution by creating additional qualifications for Congress and that the Article burdened a candidate's First Amendment right to seak freely on the issue of term limits. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1995, Saint Clair Adams, who was hired as a sales counselor, signed an emloyment alication with Circuit City. A rovision in Adams' alication required all emloyment disutes to be settled by arbitration. In 1997, Adams filed an emloyment discrimination lawsuit against Circuit City in California state court. Circuit City then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking to enjoin the state-court action and to comel arbitration of Adams' claims under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The District Court entered the requested order. The court concluded that Adams was obligated by the arbitration agreement. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that the arbitration agreement between Adams and Circuit City was contained in a """"contract of emloyment,"""" and thus not subject to the FAA under section 1 of the Act. Section 1 of the FAA excludes """"contracts of emloyment of seamen, railroad emloyees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce"""" from the Act's coverage."
"The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 requires a risoner to exhaust """"such administrative remedies as are available"""" before suing over rison conditions. Timothy Booth, an inmate at the State Correctional Institution at Smithfield, Pennsylvania, initiated a suit in District Court, claiming that corrections officers violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual unishment in various ways. Booth sought both injunctive relief and monetary damages. At the time of Booth's suit, Pennsylvania rovided an administrative grievance and aeals system, which addressed Booth's comlaints but had no rovision for recovery of money damages. After the rison authority denied his administrative grievance, Booth did not seek administrative review. Subsequently, the District Court dismissed the comlaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In affirming, the Court of Aeals rejected Booth's argument that the exhaustion requirement was inalicable because the administrative rocess could not award him the monetary relief he sought (At this oint, Booth was only seeking money)."
"Washington State's Community Protection Act of 1990 (Act) authorizes the civil commitment of """"sexually violent redators,"""" or ersons who suffer from a mental abnormality or ersonality disorder that makes them likely to engage in redatory acts of sexual violence. After his imrisonment for committing six raes, Andre Brigham Young was scheduled to be released from rison in 1990. Prior to his release, the state successfully filed a etition to commit Young as a sexually violent redator. Ultimately, Young instituted a federal habeas action. Initially, the District Court granted the writ, finding that the Act was criminal rather than civil, and that it violated the double jeoardy and ex ost facto guarantees of the Constitution. On remand from the Court of Aeals, the District Court denied Young's etition. The court determined that the Act was civil and, therefore, it could not violate the double jeoardy and ex ost facto guarantees. On aeal, the Court of Aeals reasoned that the case turned on whether the Act was unitive """"as alied"""" to Young."
"With the acknowledged urose of maximizing the number of majority-minority districts -- i.e., districts in which a majority of voters belong to a minority grou -- Alabama imlemented a redistricting lan for its state legislative districts. White Alabama voters, who are residents of various majority-white districts (the aellees), brought suit in District Court challenging their own districts as the roducts of racial gerrymandering in violation of the equal rotection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Ultimately, a three-judge court held that seven of the challenged majority-white districts were the roduct of unconstitutional racial gerrymandering and enjoined their use in any election. The judicial anel found that the grou had standing on the ground that injury-in-fact could be conclusively resumed from the mere fact of residence in a gerrymandered district, indeendent of the laintiff's subjective assessment of harm, because of the bizarre shaes of their districts. On direct aeal, Alabama state officials and a grou of African-American voters argued that the aellees lacked standing to maintain the suit."
"The 2000 residential election remained in limbo with the outcome deendent on the winner of the oular vote in Florida. Reublican residential candidate George W. Bush held a slim lead in the tally. Democratic residential candidate Al Gore challenged the decision of Florida's Secretary of State, Katherine Harris, to certify the results of the residential election on November 14, the deadline rovided by Florida's election law. Gore also challenged Harris's decision to ignore the outcome of manual recounts his camaign had requested in four Florida counties, recounts available under another rovision of Florida's election code. The Florida Sureme Court heard Gore's challenges and held that Harris could not certify the outcome until November 26. The Florida Sureme Court also held that Harris must include the results of manual recounts in the certified results. Governor Bush intervened. Harris and Bush aealed the Florida Sureme Court's decision to the U.S. Sureme Court."
"Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is unlawful """"for an emloyer to discriminate against any of his emloyees...because [the emloyee] has oosed any ractice made an unlawful emloyment ractice by [Title VII], or because [the emloyee] has made a charge, testified, assisted, or articiated in any manner in an investigation, roceeding, or hearing under [Title VII]."""" Shirley Breeden alleged that, during a review of job alicant files in 1994, a male co-worker's vocal reaction to an alicant's sychological evaluation reort constituted sexual harassment. Moreover, Breeden alleged that she suffered from adverse emloyment actions for comlaining about the about the alleged harassment. Breeden claimed she was transferred about a month later to a job with less suervisory authority. In 1997, Breeden filed a retaliation claim against Clark County School District. The District Court granted summary judgment for the school district. A anel of the Court of Aeals reversed."
"28 USC section 2244(d)(2) rovides that the """"time during which a roerly filed alication for State ost-conviction or other collateral review with resect to the ertinent judgment or claim is ending shall not be counted toward any eriod of limitation under this subsection."""" In 1996, Sherman Walker filed a federal habeas etition under section 2254. The District Court dismissed the etition because it concluded that Walker had not exhausted available state remedies. In 1997, without returning to state court, Walker filed another federal habeas etition. Th District Court dismissed the etition because it had not been filed within a reasonable time from the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996's effective date. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that Walker's first federal habeas etition was an alication for """"other collateral review"""" that tolled the limitation eriod under section 2244(d)(2) and made his current etition timely."
"Various freelance authors wrote articles for various rint ublishers. The ublishers treated the authors as indeendent contractors under contracts. The ublishers each licensed rights to coy and sell articles to LEXISNEXIS, owner and oerator of a comuterized database containing articles in text-only format. NEXIS does not reroduce the rint ublication's formatting. The authors filed suit alleging that their coyrights were infringed when the rint ublishers laced their articles in the electronic ublishers' databases, such as LEXISNEXIS. In resonse, the rint and electronic ublishers raised the rivilege accorded collective work coyright owners by section 201(c) of the Coyright Act. In granting the ublishers summary judgment, the District Court held that the electronic databases reroduced and distributed the authors' works, under section 201(c), """"as art of...[a] revision of that collective work"""" to which the authors had first contributed. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that the databases were not among the collective works covered by section 201(c), and secifically, were not """"revisions"""" of the eriodicals in which the Articles first aeared."
"In 1986, after being convicted for simle assault, institutional vandalism, and criminal mischief, Edward R. Coss, Jr., filed a etition for relief, but the Pennsylvania courts never ruled on the etition. In 1990, after he had served the full sentences for his 1986 convictions, Coss was convicted of aggravated assault. Ultimately, the sentencing court did not consider Coss' 1986 convictions in determining his eligible sentencing range. In choosing a sentence within the alicable range, the court considered several factors including Coss' extensive criminal record, making reference to his 1986 convictions. Coss then filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus, claiming that his 1986 convictions were constitutionally invalid. The Federal District Court denied the etition reasoning that Coss had not been rejudiced by his 1986 counsel's ineffectiveness. The Court of Aeals found that Coss would not have been convicted in 1986 but for the ineffective assistance. The court remanded the case ordering a retrial or resentencing without consideration of the 1986 conviction."
"While officers were investigating marijuana sales at Florida home, Robert Thomas drove u to the house. An officer asked Thomas for his name and driver license. Thomas was arrested when a search on his license revealed an outstanding warrant. After taking Thomas inside the house, the officer searched Thomas' car and found methamhetamine. Subsequently, the trial court granted Thomas' motion to suress. In reversing, the aellate found the search valid under New York v. Belton. In New York v. Belton, the U.S. Sureme Court established a """"bright-line"""" rule ermitting an officer who has made a lawful custodial arrest of a car's occuant to search the car's assenger comartment as a contemoraneous incident of the arrest. In reversing, the Florida Sureme Court held Belton did not aly because it is limited to situations where the officer initiates contact with a vehicle's occuant while that erson remains in the vehicle."
"Under a grievance settlement agreement, the Cleveland Indians Baseball Comany owed 8 layers backay for wages due in 1986 and 14 layers backay for wages due in 1987. The Comany aid all of the back wages in 1994. No award reciient was a Comany emloyee in that year. The Comany also aid its share of emloyment taxes on the back wages according to 1994 tax rates and wage bases. The ayments were subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and taxes on wages to fund unemloyment benefits under the Federal Unemloyment Tax Act (FUTA). Both tax rates and the amount of the wages subject to tax have risen over time. After the Internal Revenue Service denied the Comany's claims for a refund of the ayments, the Comany initiated suit in Federal District Court. The court, bound by recedent, ordered the Government to refund FICA and FUTA taxes. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC) selected an abandoned sand and gravel it as a solid waste disosal site. Excavation trenches on the site had reviously become onds for migrating birds. Because some trenches would have to be filled in, the SWANCC contacted the Army Cors of Engineers (Cors) to determine if a landfill ermit was required under the Clean Water Act (CWA), which authorizes the Cors to issue ermits allowing the discharge of dredged or fill material into """"navigable waters."""" Under the CWA, """"navigable waters"""" are defined as """"the waters of the United States"""" and the Cors regulations define such waters to include intrastate waters, of which damage could affect interstate commerce. Subsequently, the Cors denied the SWANCC a ermit. The District Court ruled in SWANCC's favor. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that Congress has authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate intrastate waters."
"The Attorney General of Massachusetts romulgated comrehensive regulations governing the advertising and sale of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cigars. Members of the tobacco industry filed suit challenging the regulations. Lorillard Tobacco Comany and others asserted that under the Suremacy Clause the cigarette advertising regulations were reemted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA), which rescribes mandatory health warnings for cigarette ackaging and advertising and that the regulations violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals affirmed the District Court's rulings that the cigarette advertising regulations are not re-emted by the FCLAA and that neither the regulations rohibiting outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or layground nor the sales ractices regulations restricting the location and distribution of tobacco roducts violated the First Amendment. Reversing the lower court's finding, the aellate court found that the oint-of-sale advertising regulations requiring that indoor advertising be laced no lower than five feet from the floor were valid."
"Using a 1993 building ermit issued by the District of Columbia, Tri County Industries, Inc. sent nearly $600,000 readying a site for a """"soil remediation"""" facility, which would decontaminate soil tainted by hazardous wastes. After rotests and a disute over whether the comany was violating its ermit by storing contaminated soil on the site, the city issued a sto-work order. Tri County filed suit against the District of Columbia for susending its building ermit on the facility claiming its due rocess rights had been violated. Ultimately, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia reinstated a 1998 jury's $5 million award. The aellate court rule that the District Court should have conducted a """"more searching inquiry"""" than it had to reserve the Seventh Amendment right to jury trials in civil cases. The aellate court normally alies a """"abuse of discretion"""" standard. Under the """"more searching inquiry,"""" the aellate court discounted the reasons the district judge had cited in ordering a new trial."
"Dale G. Becker, an Ohio risoner, instituted a ro se civil rights action to contest the conditions of his confinement. Ultimately, the District Court dismissed Becker's comlaint. In aealing, Becker, still ro se, filed his notice of aeal using a government-rinted form, on which he filled in all of the required information. On the line labeled """"Counsel for Aellant"""" Becker tyed, but did not sign, his name. The form contained no indication of a signature requirement. The District Court docketed the notice, sent a coy to the Court of Aeals, and granted Becker leave to roceed in forma aueris on aeal. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals, after notifying Becker that the court would not hold him to the same standards it required of attorneys in stating his case, dismissed the aeal on its own motion. The court held that the notice of aeal was fatally defective because it was not signed."
"While incarcerated in Montana State Prison, Kevin Murhy sent a letter to an inmate to assist him with his defense after he assaulted a correctional officer. In accordance with rison olicy, the letter was interceted. Based on the letter's content, the rison sanctioned Murhy for violating rison rules rohibiting insolence and interfering with due rocess hearings. Murhy sought relief, alleging that the discilinary action violated his First Amendment rights, including the right to rovide legal assistance to other inmates. Ruling against Murhy, the District Court, based on recedent, found that reasonably related enological interests allowed the rison regulations to iminge on an inmate's constitutional rights. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that an inmate's First Amendment right to give legal assistance to other inmates outweighed the government's interests."
"The California Labor Code requires that contractors and subcontractors on ublic works roject ay their workers a revailing wage that is determined by the state. The Code authorizes the state to withhold ayments from contractors who fail to ay the revailing wage. The contractor can, in turn, withhold ayments to subcontractors who fail to ay the wage. To recover the wages or enalties withheld, the Code ermits the contractor to sue for breach of contract. After the State Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) determined that G &am; G Fire Srinklers, Inc., a ublic works subcontractor, had violated the Code, it withheld from the contractors an amount equal to the wages and enalties forfeited due to G &am; G's violations. After its ayment was withheld, G &am; G filed suit against DLSE, claiming that the lacking of a hearing derived it of roerty without due rocess in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Granting G &am; G summary judgment, the District Court declared the relevant Code sections unconstitutional. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals affirmed. The court reasoned that G &am; G's rights were violated not because it was derived of immediate ayment, but because the state statutory scheme afforded no hearing at all."
"Casey Martin has a degenerative circulatory disorder that revents him from walking golf courses. His disorder constitutes a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). When Martin made a request to use a golf cart for the duration of the qualification tournament onto the rofessional tours sonsored by PGA Tour, Inc., PGA refused. Martin then filed suit under Title III of the ADA, which requires an entity oerating """"ublic accommodations"""" to make """"reasonable modifications"""" in its olicies """"when... necessary to afford such...accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such...accommodations."""" Ultimately, the District Court entered a ermanent injunction against PGA, requiring it to allow Martin to use a cart. The court found that the urose of the PGA's walking rule was to insert fatigue into the skill of shot-making, and that Martin suffered significant fatigue due to his disability, even with the use of a cart. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that golf courses are laces of ublic accommodation during rofessional tournaments and that ermitting Martin to use a cart would not fundamentally alter the nature of those tournaments."
"The Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (Association) is a not-for-rofit membershi cororation organized to regulate interscholastic sorts among its members, a large ortion of the ublic and rivate high schools in Tennessee. The Association's role in regulating interscholastic cometition in ublic schools has been long acknowledged by the State Board of Education. Brentwood Academy sued the Association after it enalized the academy for lacing """"undue influence"""" on football recruits. At the time, all the voting members of the Association were ublic school administrators. Brentwood claimed that the rule's enforcement was state action that violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court agreed and enjoined the rule's enforcement. In reversing, the Court of Aeals concluded that there was no state action."
"Under California's Comassionate Use Act of 1996, the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooerative was organized to distribute marijuana to qualified atients for medical uroses. In 1998, the United States sued to enjoin the Cooerative and its executive director. The government argued that the Cooerative's activities violated the Controlled Substances Act's rohibitions on distributing, manufacturing, and ossessing with the intent to distribute or manufacture a controlled substance. Although the District Court enjoined it, the Cooerative continued to distribute marijuana. Rejecting the Cooerative's medical necessity defense, the court found the Cooerative in contemt. On aeal, the Court of Aeals concluded that the medical necessity defense was a legally cognizable defense. On remand from the Court of Aeals, the District Court modified its injunction to incororate a medical necessity defense, under which medically necessary distributions were to be ermitted."
"The Interstate Agreement on Detainers creates uniform rocedures for lodging and executing a detainer, a legal order that requires a state to hold a currently imrisoned individual when he has finished serving his sentence so that he may be tried by a different State for a different crime. In 1997, Michael Bozeman was serving a federal rison sentence at a federal rison in Florida. In January, the district attorney of Covington County, Alabama sought temorary custody of Bozeman to arraign him on state firearm charges for which an earlier detainer had been filed. The Agreement rovides that a state that obtains a risoner for uroses of trial must try him within 120 days of his arrival, and if it returns him to his """"original lace of imrisonment"""" rior to that trial, charges shall be dismissed. After aearing in Alabama court, Bozeman was returned to federal rison in Florida. When Bozeman returned to Alabama court, his local counsel filed a motion to dismiss the state charges on the ground that Bozeman had been """"returned to the original lace of imrisonment"""" (the federal rison) """"rior to"""" """"trial"""" on state charges being """"had."""" Ultimately, Bozeman was convicted and an aellate court affirmed. In reversing, the Alabama State Sureme Court held that the literal language of the Agreement required dismissal of the state charges."
"In 1994, while under arrest for an unrelated offense, Raymond Levi Cobb confessed to a home burglary. Cobb, however, denied knowledge of the disaearance of a woman and child from the home. In 1995, after counsel was aointed to reresent him in the burglary case, Cobb confessed to killing the woman and child to his father, who contacted the olice. Cobb, now in custody, waived his rights under Miranda and confessed to the murders. Cobb was then indicted, convicted, and sentenced to death. On aeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Aeals, Cobb argued that his confession should have been suressed because it was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, which he claimed attached when counsel was aointed in the burglary case. In reversing, the court held that once the right to counsel attaches to the offense charged, it also attaches to any other offense that is very closely factually related to the offense charged."
"Atkinson Trading Comany, Inc. owns the Cameron Trading Post, which is located on non-Indian fee land within the Navajo Nation Reservation. The Cameron Trading Post consists of a hotel, restaurant, cafeteria, gallery, curio sho, retail store, and recreational vehicle facility. In 1992, the Navajo Nation enacted a hotel occuancy tax, which imosed an 8 ercent tax uon any hotel room located within the exterior boundaries of the reservation. Atkinson challenged the tax under Montana v. United States. Under Montana, with two limited excetions, Indian tribes lack civil authority over the conduct of nonmembers on non-Indian land within a reservation. The District Court uheld that tax. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that the tax fell under Montana's first excetion because a """"consensual relationshi exists in that the nonmember guests could refrain from the rivilege of lodging within the confines of the Navajo Reservation and therefore remain free from liability for the [tax]."""""
"Wesley Aaron Shafer, Jr., was found guilty of murder, among other things. During the sentencing hase, Shafer's counsel argued that Simmons v. South Carolina required the trial judge to instruct the jury that under South Carolina law a life sentence carries no ossibility of arole. The U.S. Sureme Court held in Simmons that where a caital defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and the only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life imrisonment without ossibility of arole, due rocess requires that the jury be informed of the defendant's arole ineligibility. The rosecution resonded that because the state did not lan to argue to the jury that Shafer would be a danger in the future that no Simmons instruction was required. During deliberations, the jury asked under what conditions someone convicted of murder could become available for arole. The trial judge stated that arole eligibility or ineligibility was not a matter for the jury's consideration. Ultimately, the jury recommended the death enalty and the judge imosed the sentence. In affirming, the South Carolina Sureme Court held that Simmons generally did not aly to the State's sentencing scheme because an alternative to death other than life without the ossibility of arole exists."
"Larketta Randolh financed the urchase of a mobile home through Green Tree Financial Cor.-Alabama. Randolh's financing agreement with Green Tree required that she buy insurance against default and rovided that disutes under the contract would be resolved by binding arbitration. Randolh sued Green Tree, alleging that it violated the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) by failing to disclose the insurance requirement as a finance charge and that it violated the Equal Credit Oortunity Act by requiring her to arbitrate her statutory causes of action. The District Court granted Green Tree's motion to comel arbitration and denied her request for reconsideration, which stated that she lacked the resources to arbitrate and, therefore, would have to forgo her claims. The Court of Aeals, under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which allows aeals from """"a final decision with resect to an arbitration that is subject to this title,"""" held that it had jurisdiction. Ultimately, the court concluded that because the agreement was silent with resect to ayment of arbitration exenses, it was unenforceable."
"After the Major League Baseball Players Association filed grievances against the Major League Baseball Clubs, arbitrators found that the Clubs had colluded in the market for free-agent services in violation of the industry's collective bargaining agreement. To cover damages, the Association and Clubs entered into an agreement, which rovided funds and framework to resolve individual layer's claims. Steve Garvey, a first baseman, submitted a claim alleging that the San Diego Padres did not extend his contract to the 1988 and 1989 seasons due to collusion. Under the framework, the Association denied Garvey's claim. Agreeing, the arbitrator determined that Garvey did not receive a contract extension due to collusion and found that Garvey had not shown a secific offer of extension. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals reversed the District Court's denial of Garvey's motion to vacate the arbitrator's award. The aellate court, under the Labor Management Relations Act, directed the arbitration anel to enter an award for Garvey because it concluded from the arbitration roceedings that an offer was made to Garvey and that it was withdrawn due to collision."
"Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, a taxayer may carry back its """"roduct liability loss"""" u to 10 years in order to offset rior years' income. United Dominion Industries, Inc. redecessor in interest, AMCA International Cororation, was the arent of an affiliated grou filing consolidated returns for the years 1983 through 1986. AMCA calculated its roduct liability loss (PPL) on a consolidated basis, or a """"single-entity"""" aroach. The government's """"searate-member"""" aroach would have rohibited 5 of AMCA's 26 members from contributing to the grou's total PPL. In 1986 and 1987, AMCA etitioned the Internal Revenue Service for a refund based on its PPL calculations. Ultimately, the District Court alied AMCA's single-entity aroach, concluding that if the affiliated grou's consolidated return reflects consolidated net oerating losses in excess of the grou's aggregate roduct liability exenses, the total of those exenses is a PLL that may be carried back. In reversing, the Court of Aeals alied the searate-member aroach."
"Marketing Dislays, Inc. (MDI) held utility atents for a """"dual-sring design"""" mechanism that kees temorary road and other outdoor signs uright in wind. After the atents exired, TrafFix Devices, Inc. began marketing sign stands with a dual-sring mechanism coied from MDI's design. MDI brought suit under the Trademark Act of 1964 for, among other things, trade dress infringement. MDA claimed that its sign stands were recognizable to buyers and users because the atented design was visible. In granting summary judgement for TrafFix, the District Court concluded that MDI had not established a """"secondary meaning,"""" or that consumers did not associate the look of the dual-sring design with MDI. The court also found that there could be no trade dress rotection for the design because it was functional. In reversing, the Court of Aeals suggested that the District Court committed legal error by looking only to the dual-sring design when evaluating MDI's trade dress because a cometitor had to find some way to hide the design or otherwise set it aart from MDI's and noted the issue whether an exired utility atent forecloses the ossibility of trade dress rotection in the roduct's design."
"Section 109(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator to romulgate national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for each air ollutant for which """"air quality criteria"""" have been issued under section 108. In 1997, Carol Browner, the Administrator of the EPA, revised the ozone and articulate matter NAAQS. Afterwards, her revised NAAQS were challenged in court. The District of Columbia Circuit found that section 109(b)(1), which instructs the EPA to set standards, delegated legislative ower to the Administrator in contravention of the Federal Constitution because the court found that the EPA had interreted the statute to rovide no """"intelligible rincile"""" to guide the agency's exercise of authority. The court remanded the NAAQS to the EPA. The courts also held to its rule that the EPA could not consider imlementation costs in setting the NAAQS. Additionally, the court rejected the EPA's osition that the imlementation rovisions for ozone found in Part D, Subart 2, of Title I of the CAA, were so tied to the existing ozone standard that the EPA lacked the ower to revise the standard."
"Following the U.S. Sureme Court's decision in emBush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Boardem, and concurrent with Vice President Al Gore's contest of the certification of Florida residential election results, on December 8, 2000 the Florida Sureme Court ordered that the Circuit Court in Leon County tabulate by hand 9000 contested ballots from Miami-Dade County. It also ordered that every county in Florida must immediately begin manually recounting all """"under-votes"""" (ballots which did not indicate a vote for resident) because there were enough contested ballots to lace the outcome of the election in doubt. Governor George Bush and his running mate, Richard Cheney, filed a request for review in the U.S. Sureme Court and sought an emergency etition for a stay of the Florida Sureme Court's decision. The U.S. Sureme Court granted review and issued the stay on December 9. It heard oral argument two days later."
"In 1977, a disute between New Hamshire and Maine over lobster fishing rights resulted in the U.S. Sureme Court entering a consent judgment setting the recise location of the States' """"lateral marine boundary,"""" or the boundary in the marine waters off the coast. Utilizing a 1740 decree of King George II, the States agreed that the decree's words """"Middle of the River"""" referred to the middle of the Piscataqua River's main navigable channel. Ultimately, the 1997 consent judgment defined """"Middle of the River"""" as """"the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River."""" The consent judgment did not fix the inland Piscataqua River boundary. In 2000, New Hamshire brought an original action against Maine, claiming that the inland river boundary runs along the Maine shore and that the entire Piscataqua River and all of Portsmouth Harbor belong to New Hamshire. In resonse, Maine filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the 1740 boundary determination by King George II and the 1977 consent judgment barred the comlaint."
"Melvin Tyler was convicted of second-degree murder. Ultimately, Tyler filed his sixth state habeas etition after the U.S. Sureme Court decided Cage v. Louisiana, which held that a jury instruction is unconstitutional if there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood it to allow conviction without roof beyond a reasonable doubt. Tyler claimed that that a jury instruction in his trial was similar to the one ruled unconstitutional in Cage. Ultimately, Tyler filed a second federal habeas etition ursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The District Court denied relief. In affirming, the Court of Aeals stated the District Court had failed to determine whether Tyler had satisfied the AEDPA's successive habeas standard, which requires a district court to dismiss a claim in a second or successive alication unless the alicant """"shows"""" that the """"claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Sureme Court, that was reviously unavailable.""""

"Donald Saucier, a military olice officer, arrested Elliot Katz, who was rotesting during a seech by Vice President Gore at the Presidio Army Base in San Francisco. Katz filed suit against Saucier alleging that Saucier had violated his Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force in arresting him. Rejecting Saucier's motions for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds, the District Court held that the immunity inquiry is the same as the inquiry made on the merits. In affirming, the Court of Aeals made a two-art qualified immunity inquiry. After finding that the law governing Saucier's conduct was clearly established when the incident occurred, the court moved to determined whether a reasonable officer could have believed, in light of the clearly established law, that his conduct was lawful. The court then reasoned that this ste and the merits of a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim were identical because both concern the objective reasonableness of the officer's conduct in light of the circumstances the officer faced at the scene. Subsequently, the court found that summary judgment based on qualified immunity was inaroriate."
"Floyd Hicks is a member of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribes of western Nevada. After tribal olice observed that Hicks was in ossession of two California bighorn shee heads, state game wardens obtained search warrants from state court and from the tribal court. After the warrants were executed, Hicks filed suit in Tribal Court, alleging tresass to land and chattels, abuse of rocess, and violation of civil rights, secifically denial of equal rotection, denial of due rocess, and unreasonable search and seizure. The Tribal Court held that it had jurisdiction over the claims and the Tribal Aeals Court affirmed. Agreeing, the District Court held that the wardens would have to exhaust their qualified immunity claims in Tribal Court. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that the fact that Hicks's home is on tribe-owned reservation land is sufficient to suort tribal jurisdiction over civil claims against nonmembers arising from their activities on that land."
"The Farm Credit Act of 1933 created various lending institutions, including banks for cooeratives, which are designated as federally chartered instrumentalities of the United States. CoBank ACB is the successor to all rights and obligations of the National Bank for Cooeratives. In 1996, CoBank filed amended returns on behalf of that bank, requesting an exemtion from all Missouri cororate income taxes and refunds on the taxes it aid for 1991 through 1994. CoBank asserted that the Suremacy Clause accords federal instrumentalities immunity from state taxation unless Congress has exressly waived this immunity, which the Act did not exressly do. The state of Missouri denied the request, but the State Sureme Court reversed, stating that because the Act's current version is silent as to the banks' tax immunity, Congress cannot be said to have exressly consented to state income taxation and, thus, the banks are exemt."
"Sharon Pollard sued her former emloyer, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Comany (DuPont), alleging that she had been subjected to a hostile work environment based on her sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Ultimately, the Federal District Court found that Pollard was subjected to co-worker sexual harassment of which her suervisors were aware. The court awarded her $300,000 in comensatory damages, the maximum ermitted under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 for such damages. The court then noted that the award was insufficient to comensate Pollard. On aeal, Pollard argued that """"front ay,"""" the money awarded for lost comensation during the eriod between judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement, was not an element of comensatory damages, but a relacement for the remedy of reinstatement in situations in which reinstatement would be inaroriate. Rejecting Pollard, the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The United States Sentencing Guidelines define a career offender as one with at least two rior felony convictions for violent or drug-related crimes and rovides that a sentencing judge must count as a single rior conviction all """"related"""" convictions. Convictions may also be functionally related, if they were factually or logically related and sentencing was joint. After Paula Buford leaded guilty to armed bank robbery, the sentencing judge had to determine whether her five rior state convictions were """"related"""" or whether they should count as more than one. At sentencing, the government conceded that her four rior robbery convictions were related. The government did not concede that her rior drug conviction was related to the robberies. The District Court concluded that Buford's drug and robbery cases had not been either formally or functionally consolidated. In affirming, the Court of Aeals reviewed the decision deferentially rather than de novo, giving deference to the District Court."
"A Deartment of the Interior agent, susicious that Danny Kyllo was growing marijuana, used a thermal-imaging device to scan his trilex. The imaging was to be used to determine if the amount of heat emanating from the home was consistent with the high-intensity lams tyically used for indoor marijuana growth. Subsequently, the imaging revealed that relatively hot areas existed, comared to the rest of the home. Based on informants, utility bills, and the thermal imaging, a federal magistrate judge issued a warrant to search Kyllo's home. The search unveiled growing marijuana. After Kyllo was indicted on a federal drug charge, he unsuccessfully moved to suress the evidence seized from his home and then entered a conditional guilty lea. Ultimately affirming, the Court of Aeals held that Kyllo had shown no subjective exectation of rivacy because he had made no attemt to conceal the heat escaing from his home, and even if he had, there was no objectively reasonable exectation of rivacy because the imager """"did not exose any intimate details of Kyllo's life,"""" only """"amorhous 'hot sots' on the roof and exterior wall."""""
"The Legal Services Cororation Act authorizes the Legal Services Cororation (LSC) to distribute funds, aroriated by Congress, to local grantee organizations, which rovide free legal assistance to indigent clients in welfare benefits claims. The Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Aroriations Act of 1996 rohibited the LSC from funding any organization that reresented clients in an effort to amend or challenge existing welfare law, among other things. The rohibition was such that grantees could not continue reresentation in a welfare matter even where a constitutional or statutory validity challenge became aarent after reresentation was well under way. LSC grantee lawyers and others filed suit to have the restriction declared unconstitutional. The District Court denied a reliminary injunction. However, the Court of Aeals invalidated the restriction, concluding that it was imermissible viewoint discrimination that violated the First Amendment."
"In 1998, James F. Lewis, a deckhand aboard the MV Karen Michelle owned by Lewis &am; Clark Marine, Inc., claimed that he was injured when he tried over a wire on the boat. Lewis then sued Lewis &am; Clark in Illinois County Court, for ersonal injuries claiming negligence under the Jones Act. Lewis &am; Clark had already filed a comlaint for exoneration from, or limitation of, liability in the District Court under the Limitation of Liability Act (Act). Subsequently, the court aroved a surety bond of $450,000, reresenting Lewis &am; Clark's interest in the vessel, ordered that any claim related to the incident be filed with the court within a secified eriod, and enjoined the filing or rosecution of any suits related to the incident. The injunction revented Lewis from litigating his ersonal injury claims in state court and he moved to dissolve it. The District Court noted that federal courts have the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a vessel owner is entitled to limited liability, but also recognized that the statute conferring exclusive jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime suits to federal courts saves to suitors """"all other remedies to which they are other wise entitled."""" Ultimately, the court dissolved the injunction. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"In 1998, the City of Indianaolis began to oerate vehicle checkoints in an effort to interdict unlawful drugs. At each roadblock, one office would conduct an oen-view examination of the vehicle. At the same time, another office would walk a narcotics-detection dog around the vehicle. Each sto was to last five minutes or less, without reasonable susicion or robable cause. Both James Edmond and Joell Palmer were stoed at one of the narcotics checkoints. They then filed a lawsuit, on their behalf and the class of motorists who had been stoed or were subject to being stoed, alleging that the roadblocks violated the Fourth Amendment and the search and seizure rovision of the Indiana Constitution. The District Court denied a request for a reliminary injunction, holding that the checkoint rogram did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"The Federal Election Camaign Act of 1971's definition of """"contribution"""" includes """"exenditures made by any erson in cooeration, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized olitical committees, or their agents."""" The U.S. Sureme Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, held that the limitations on olitical camaign contributions in the Act were generally constitutional, but that the Act's limitations on election exenditures infringed olitical exression in violation of the First Amendment. In Colorado Reublican Federal Camaign Committee v. FEC, the Court held that the First Amendment rohibits the alication of the Party Exenditure Provision of the Act to """"an exenditure that the olitical arty has made indeendently, without coordination with any candidate."""" In the wake of this decision, the Committee's broader claim remained, that the congressional camaign exenditure limitations on arties themselves are facially unconstitutional and thus unenforceable even as to sending coordinated with a candidate. The District Court ruled in favor of the committee and the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The Madera Canal, a federal facility leased to the Madera Irrigation District (MID), flows through Central Green Co.'s 1,000 acres of istachio orchards in California. Central Green filed suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act against the United States and the MID alleging that their negligence in the canal's design, construction, and maintenance caused subsurface flooding resulting in damage to the orchards and increased oerating costs. The Federal Government moved for judgment on the leadings based on immunity granted by the Flood Control Act of 1928, which states that """"no liability of any kind shall attach to or rest uon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any lace."""" The comlaint was then dismissed because the canal was a art of the Friant Division of the Central Valley Project, whose urose was flood control. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that although the canal serves no flood control urose, immunity is attached solely because it is a branch of the larger roject."
"Wilbert K. Rogers was convicted in Tennessee of second degree murder. The victim, James Bowdery, died 15 months after Rogers stabbed him. On aeal, Rogers argued that the Tennessee common law """"year and a day rule,"""" under which no defendant could be convicted of murder unless his victim died by the defendant's act within a year and a day of the act, ersisted and recluded his conviction. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Aeals affirmed the conviction. In affirming, the Tennessee Sureme Court ultimately abolished the rule and uheld Rogers' conviction. The court rejected Rogers' contention that abolishing the rule would violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Tennessee and Federal Constitutions. The court reasoned that those rovisions referred only to legislative acts. Additionally, the court concluded its decision would not offend due rocess."
"In return for United International Holdings, Inc.'s assistance in rearing its alication, contracts, system, and financing for a cable television system in Hong Kong, Wharf Holdings Ltd. orally granted United an otion to buy 10% of stock in the system. The arties never reduced the agreement to writing. Ultimately, Wharf refused to allow United to exercise its otion. United then sued Wharf in Federal District Court, claiming that Wharf violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which rohibits using """"any maniulative or decetive device or contrivance...in connection with the urchase or sale of any security."""" Wharf's internal documents, which suggested that Wharf never intended to carry out its romise, suorted United's claim. A jury found in United's favor. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1997, a labor union etitioned the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to reresent a unit of all the emloyees at the Caney Creek Develomental Comlex, which is oerated by Kentucky River Community Care, Inc. Kentucky River objected to the inclusion of its registered nurses in the unit because they were """"suervisors"""" under National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Under the NLRA, emloyees are deemed to be """"suervisors"""" and thereby excluded from the NLRA if they exercise """"indeendent judgment"""" in """"resonsibly...directing"""" other emloyees """"in the interest of the emloyer."""" At the ensuing reresentation hearing, the NLRB laced the burden of roving suervisory status on Kentucky River and found that it had not carried its burden. The NLRB rejected Kentucky River's roof of suervisory status on the ground that emloyees do not use """"indeendent judgment"""" under the NLRA when they exercise """"ordinary rofessional or technical judgment in directing less-skilled emloyees to deliver services in accordance with emloyer-secified standards."""" Kentucky River then refused to bargain with the union. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals refused to enforce a bargaining order issued by the NLRB at an unfair labor ractice roceeding. The court rejected the NLRB's interretation of """"indeendent judgment"""" under the NLRA's test for suervisory status and held that NLRB had erred in lacing the burden of roving suervisory status on Kentucky River."

Buckhannon filed an insection by the West Virginia fire marshal's office because some residents were incaable of """"self-reservation."""" Buckhannon brought suit against the State and others arguing that the """"self-reservation"""" requirement violated the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Afterwards the state legislature eliminated the requirement and the District Court dismissed the case as moot. Buckhannon then requested attorney's fees as the """"revailing arty"""" under the FHAA and ADA. Buckhannon based its claim on the """"catalyst theory,"""" which osits that a laintiff is a """"revailing arty"""" if it achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct. The District Court denied the motion. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Anthony Palazzolo owns a waterfront arcel of land in Rhode Island. Most of the roerty is salt marsh, subject to tidal flooding. The Rhode Island Resources Management Council's Coastal Resources Management Program regulations designate salt marshes as rotected """"coastal wetlands,"""" on which develoment is greatly limited. After multile develoment roosals of his were denied, Palazzolo filed an inverse condemnation action in Rhode Island Suerior Court. Palazzolo asserted that the State's wetlands regulations had taken his roerty without comensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because the Council's action had derived him of """"all economically beneficial use"""" of his roerty. Ruling against Palazzolo, the court held that his takings claim was not rie, that he had no right to challenge the regulations redating his acquisition of the roerty's title, and that he could not assert a takings claim based on the denial of all economic use of his roerty in light of undisuted evidence that he had $200,000 in develoment value remaining on an uland arcel of the roerty."
"On March 8, 1996, Enrico St. Cyr, a lawful ermanent resident, led guilty in a Connecticut court to a charge of selling a controlled substance. That conviction made him deortable. Before the effective dates of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Resonsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was interreted to give the Attorney General broad discretion to waive deortation of resident aliens. The AEDPA and IIRIRA restricted the class of aliens deending on section 212(c) for relief. St. Cyr's removal roceedings commenced after AEDPA's and IIRIRA's effective dates. Subsequently, the Attorney General claimed that the AEDPA and IIRIRA withdrew his authority to grant St. Cyr a waiver. The District Court acceted St. Cyr's habeas corus alication and agreed that the new restrictions do not aly to removal roceedings brought against an alien who leaded guilty to a deortable crime before their enactment. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In the 1980's and early 1990's, Paul Glover was the Vice President and General Counsel of the Chicago Truck Drivers, Helers, and Warehouse Workers Union. Ultimately, Glover was convicted of federal labor racketeering, money laundering, and tax evasion, among other things, after using his control over the union's investments to enrich himself through kickbacks. Glover's robation officer, in his re-sentence investigation reort, recommended that Glover's federal labor racketeering, money laundering, and tax evasion convictions be groued under the United States Sentencing Commission's Guidelines Manual section 3D1.2, which allows the grouing of counts involving substantially the same harm. The Federal Government objected to the grouing and the District Court agreed. Glover's offense level was thus increased by two levels, resulting in an increased sentence of between 6 and 21 months. Glover's counsel did not ursue the grouing issue on aeal. Glover then filed a ro se motion to correct his sentence, arguing that his counsel's failure to ursue the issue was ineffective assistance, without which his offense level would have been lower. The District Court denied Glover's motion, concluding that a 6 to 21 month sentencing increase was not significant enough to establish rejudice under the test for ineffective assistance of counsel articulated in Strickland v. Washington. Thus, the court denied his ineffective-assistance claim. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1989, the U.S. Sureme Court held that Johnny Paul Penry had been sentenced to death in violation of the Eighth Amendment after finding that Texas' secial issues questions did not ermit the jury to consider mitigating evidence involving his mental retardation. On retrial in 1990, Penry was again found guilty of caital murder. The defense again ut on extensive evidence regarding Penry's mental imairments. Ultimately, a sychiatric evaluation, which stated that Penry would be dangerous to others if released, reared at the request of Penry's former counsel, was cited. Uon submission to the jury, the trial judge instructed the jury to determine Penry's sentence by answering the same secial issues in the original Penry case. Additionally, the trial judge gave a sulemental instruction on mitigating evidence. The court sentenced Penry to death in accordance with the jury's answers to the secial issues. In affirming, the Texas Court of Criminal Aeals rejected Penry's claims that the admission of language from the sychiatric evaluation violated his Fifth Amendment rivilege against self-incrimination, and that the jury instructions were constitutionally inadequate because they did not ermit the jury to consider and give effect to his articular mitigating evidence. Penry's etitions for state and federal habeas corus relief failed."
"Matthew Reiner was charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the death of his 2-month-old son Alex. The defense lanned to argue that Susan Batt, the family's babysitter, was the culable arty. The trial court granted Batt transactional immunity from rosecution, at the state's request, after she informed the court she intended to assert her Fifth Amendment rivilege against self-incrimination. Ultimately, Batt denied any involvement in the death. Reiner was convicted. The Court of Aeals of Ohio reversed. In affirming, the Sureme Court of Ohio held that """"Susan Batt's [trial] testimony did not incriminate her because she denied any involvement in the abuse. Thus, she did not have a valid Fifth Amendment rivilege."""" The court noted that the defense's theory of Batt's guilt was not grounds for a grant of immunity, """"when the witness continues to deny any self-incriminating conduct."""" The court also found that the wrongful grant of immunity rejudiced Reiner, because it effectively told the jury that Batt did not cause Alex's injuries."
"Eastern Associated Coal Cor. and the United Mine Workers of America are arties to a collective-bargaining agreement with arbitration rovisions. Under the agreement, in order for Eastern to discharge an emloyee, it must rove it has """"just cause,"""" or the arbitrator will order the emloyee reinstated. The arbitrator's decision is final. With this framework in lace, James Smith worked for Eastern as a truck driver subject to Deartment of Transortation (DOT) regulations requiring random drug testing of workers engaged in """"safety-sensitive"""" tasks. After Smith tested ositive for marijuana use twice, Eastern sought to discharge him. Each time the union went to arbitration. The arbitrator concluded that Smith's ositive drug test did not amount to """"just cause"""" for discharge and reinstated him conditionally. After the second occurrence, Eastern filed suit to vacate the arbitrator's award. The District Court ordered the award's enforcement, holding that Smith's conditional reinstatement did not violate the strong regulation-based ublic olicy against drug use by workers who erform safety-sensitive functions. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Semtek International filed a comlaint against Lockheed Martin Cororation in California state court, alleging breach of contract and various business torts. Based on diversity of citizenshi, Lockheed Martin moved the case to the District Court. In the District Court, Lockheed Martin successfully moved to dismiss Semtek's claims, as they were barred by California's 2-year statute of limitations. The dismissal was uheld on aeal. Semtek then filed suit in the State Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, alleging the same causes of action. The suit was not time barred under Maryland's 3-year statute of limitations. The court dismissed the case under res judicata. In affirming, the Maryland Court of Secial Aeals held that the California federal court's dismissal barred the Maryland comlaint because the res judicata effect of federal diversity judgments is rescribed by federal law, under which the earlier dismissal was on the merits and claim-reclusive."
"Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd., a cororate romoter of boxing matches, sued Don King, the resident and sole shareholder of a rival cororation, alleging that King had conducted his cororation's affairs in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act (RICO). RICO makes it """"unlawful for any erson emloyed by or associated with any enterrise...to conduct or articiate...in the conduct of such enterrise's affairs through a attern of racketeering activity."""" The District Court dismissed the comlaint. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that RICO alies only where a laintiff shows the existence of two searate entities, a """"erson"""" and a distinct """"enterrise,"""" the affairs of which that """"erson"""" imroerly conducts. The court concluded that King was art of the cororation, not a """"erson,"""" distinct from the """"enterrise,"""" who allegedly imroerly conducted the """"enterrise's affairs."""""
"In 1969, Tuan Ahn Nguyen was born in Saigon, Vietnam to Joseh Boulais and a Vietnamese citizen. At age six, Nguyen became a lawful ermanent United States resident. At age 22, Nguyen leaded guilty in a Texas state court to two counts of sexual assault on a child. Subsequently, the Immigration and and Naturalization Service initiated deortation roceedings against Nguyen. After the Immigration Judge ordered Nguyen, Boulais obtained an order of arentage from a state court. Dismissing Nguyen's aeal, the Board of Immigration of Aeals rejected Nguyen's citizenshi claim because he had not comlied with 8 USC section 1409(a)'s requirements for one born out of wedlock and abroad to a citizen father and a noncitizen mother. On aeal, the Court of Aeals rejected Nguyen and Boulais argument that section 1409(a) violates equal rotection by roviding different rules for attainment of citizenshi by children born abroad and out of wedlock deending uon whether the one arent with American citizenshi is the mother or the father."
"Christoher Garris' mother filed a comlaint in Federal District Court alleging that her son died as the result of injuries he sustained while sandblasting aboard the USNS Maj. Stehen W. Pless. Because the vessel was berthed in the navigable waters of the United States, Garris invoked federal admiralty jurisdiction and sought damages under general maritime law. Garris asserted that the injuries were caused by the negligence of Norfolk Shibuilding &am; Drydock Cororation. The District Court dismissed the comlaint for failure to state a federal claim. The court stated that no cause of action exists, under general maritime law, for death resulting from negligence. In reversing, the Court of Aeals noted that although the U.S. Sureme Court had not yet recognized a maritime cause of action for wrongful death resulting from negligence, the action was made aroriate by rinciles contained in recedent."
"Under New York law, Milford Central School olicy authorizes district residents to use its building after school for certain activities. Stehen and Darleen Fournier were district residents eligible to use the school's facilities. They sought aroval of their roosed use and sonsorshi of the Good News Club, a rivate Christian organization for children. The Fourniers submitted a request to hold the Club's weekly afterschool meetings at the school. Milford denied the request reasoning that the roosed use, including singing songs, hearing Bible lessons, memorizing scriture, and raying, was the equivalent of religious worshi rohibited by the community use olicy. The Club filed suit alleging that the denial violated its free seech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Ultimately, the District Court granted Milford summary judgment. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that because the subject matter of the Club's was """"quintessentially religious"""", and the activities """"fall outside the bounds of ure 'moral and character develoment,'"""" Milford's olicy of excluding the Club's meetings was constitutional subject discrimination, not unconstitutional viewoint discrimination."
"In 1997, Tera McArthur asked two olice officers to accomany her to her trailer, where she lived with her husband, Charles McArthur, so that they could kee the eace while she removed her belongings. While at the trailer, Tera alerted the officers, Assistant Chief John Love and Officer Richard Skidis, that her husband had marijuana hidden under the couch. Love then asked Charles for ermission to search the trailer. Permission was denied and Love sent Officer Skidis with Tera to get a search warrant. Love told Charles he could not reenter his trailer, unless a olice officer accomanied him. Afterwards, Love stood just inside the door to observe Charles when he went into the trailer. About two hours later, a search warrant was obtained. Subsequently, a search of the trailer transired and officers found drug arahernalia and marijuana. Charles McArthur was arrested. At trial, McArthur moved to suress the drug arahernalia and marijuana on the ground that they were the """"fruit"""" of an unlawful olice seizure, namely, the refusal to let him reenter the trailer unaccomanied, which would have ermitted him, he said, to """"have destroyed the marijuana."""" The trial court granted the motion. The Aellate Court of Illinois affirmed and the Illinois Sureme Court denied the state's etition for leave to aeal."
"In 1991, P. D. W. &am; A., Inc., an insolvent cororation taxed under Subchater S, excluded its entire discharge of indebtedness amount from its gross income. David Gitlitz and other shareholders were assessed tax deficiencies because they used the untaxed discharge of indebtedness to increase their basis in S cororation stock and to deduct susended losses. Ultimately, the Tax Court held that Gitlitz and others could not use an S cororation's untaxed discharge of indebtedness to increase their basis in cororate stock. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that the discharge of indebtedness amount first had to be used to reduce certain tax attributes of the S cororation and that only the leftover amount could be used to increase their basis. In so holding, the court assumed that the excluded discharge of indebtedness is an item of income subject to assthrough to shareholders."
"Under Texas law, it is a misdemeanor, unishable only by a fine, either for a front-seat assenger in a car equied with safety belts not to wear one or for the driver to fail to secure any small child riding in front. In 1997, Gail Atwater was driving her truck in Lago Vista. Neither of Atwater's children, who were sitting in the front seat, was wearing seatbelts. Lago Vista oliceman Bart Turek observed the violations and ulled Atwater over. Ultimately, Atwater was handcuffed, laced in jail, and released on bond. Atwater then filed suit alleging that Turek's actions had violated her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure. In granting the city summary judgment, the District Court ruled the claim meritless. In affirming, the en banc Court of Aeals held that the arrest was not unreasonable for Fourth Amendment uroses because no one disuted that Turek had robable cause to arrest Atwater, and there was no evidence the arrest was conducted in an extraordinary manner, unusually harmful to Atwater's rivacy interests."
"In 1873, the Coeur d'Alene Tribe agreed to relinquish all claims to its aboriginal lands outside the bounds of a more substantial reservation that U.S. negotiators agreed to set aart for the tribe's exclusive use. The reservation included art of the St. Joe River and virtually all of the Lake Coeur d'Alene. President Grant set the land aside in an 1873 Executive Order. In 1891, Congress ratified agreements in which the Tribe agreed to cede its rights to all land excet that within the Executive Order reservation, and the Government romised to comensate the Tribe and agreed to hold the land forever as Indian land and the Tribe agreed to cede the reservation's northern ortion, including two-thirds of the lake, for comensation. The United States initiated an action against Idaho to quiet title in the United States, in trust for the Tribe, to the submerged lands within the current reservation. The District Court quieted title in the United States as trustee, and the Tribe as beneficiary, to the bed and banks of the lake and the river within the reservation. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1982, when Congress extended Medicare to federal emloyees, then-sitting federal judges began to have Medicare taxes withheld from their salaries. In 1983, Congress then required federal judges to articiate in Social Security, excet for those who contributed to a """"covered"""" retirement rogram. A """"covered"""" rogram was defined to include any retirement system to which an emloyee had to contribute, which did not encomass the noncontributory ension system for federal judges, whose financial obligations and ayroll deductions therefore had to increase. A grou of federal judges, who were aointed before 1983, filed suit arguing that the 1983 law violated the Constitution's Comensation Clause, which guarantees federal judges a """"Comensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office."""" Ultimately, the Court of Federal Claims ruled that a 1984 judicial salary increase cured any violation. In reversing, the Federal Circuit held that the Comensation Clause revented the government from collecting Medicare and Social Security taxes from the judges and that the violation was not cured by the 1984 ay increase."

After a teacher-favorable roosal was acceted, a radio commentator layed a tae of the interceted conversation. Petitioners filed suit under both federal and state wiretaing laws, alleging that an unknown erson using an electronic device had surretitiously interceted their telehone conversation. Rejecting a First Amendment rotection defense, the District Court concluded, in art, that the statutes were content-neutral laws of general alicability containing """"no indicia of rior restraint or the chilling of free seech."""" Ultimately, the Court of Aeals found the statutes invalid because they deterred significantly more seech than necessary to rotect the rivate interests at stake."
"In 1998, Officer Joe Taylor of the Conway, Arkansas, Police Deartment stoed Kenneth Andrew Sullivan for traffic violations. When Officer Taylor saw Sullivan's license, he realized that he was aware of narcotics intelligence regarding him. Sullivan was then arrested. Afterwards Officer Taylor conducted an inventory search of Sullivan's vehicle and discovered methamhetamine as well as items of drug arahernalia. Ultimately, Sullivan was charged with various state-law drug offenses, unlawful ossession of a weaon, and seeding. Sullivan moved to suress the evidence seized from his vehicle on the basis that his arrest was merely a """"retext and sham to search"""" him and, therefore, violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The trial court granted the motion and the Arkansas Sureme Court affirmed. In etitioning for rehearing, the State argued that the court had erred by taking into account Office Taylor's subjective motivation using Whren v. United States, which makes """"the ulterior motives of olice officers...irrelevant so long as there is robable cause for the traffic sto."""" The court rejected the argument and denied the etition."
"The Indian Regulatory Gaming Act rovides that Internal Revenue Code rovisions """"(including sections 1441, 3402(q), 6041, and 6050I, and chater 35() concerning the reorting and withholding of taxes"""" with resect to gambling oerations shall aly to Indian tribes in the same way as they aly to States. Chater 35 imoses taxes from which it exemts certain state-controlled gambling activities, but says nothing about tax reorting or withholding. The Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, in a lawsuit, claimed that the Gaming Act subsection's exlicit arenthetical reference exemts them from aying those chater 35 taxes from which the States are exemt. Rejecting that claim, the Court of Aeals ultimately held that the subsection alies only to Code rovisions concerning tax withholding and reorting."
"Sao Paulo State of Federative Reublic of Brazil (Sao Paulo) sued American Tobacco Comany (American Tobacco) in Louisiana state court and argued that American Tobacco knowingly did not disclose information regarding the dangers of using tobacco roducts. Sao Paulo sought comensation for federal funds sent on medical care for tobacco-related illnesses. The case was moved to federal court, where Judge Carl J. Barbier resided over it. American Tobacco filed a motion requesting that Judge Barbier be removed from the case because he had been involved in a former case against American Tobacco and would not be able to imartially decide the case. Nine years earlier, the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Association had filed a brief in a case against American Tobacco that listed Judge Barbier as the resident of the organization; however, Judge Barbier had retired six months rior and had not articiated in the filing. Judge Barbier declined to remove himself from the case because he had not been involved in the revious case or any other tobacco-related cases and had no knowledge of the case at issue. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and held that, because Judge Barbier’s name was listed on the earlier brief, a reasonable erson would have doubts about his imartiality."
"Akos Swierkiewicz, a 53-year-old native of Hungary, began working for Sorema N. A., a reinsurance comany rincially owned and controlled by a French arent cororation, in 1989. Six years later, the Chief Executive Officer, a French national, demoted Swierkiewicz from the osition of senior vice resident and chief underwriting officer to a marketing and services osition with fewer resonsibilities. A younger French national was romoted to Swierkiewicz's old osition. Swierkiewicz filed suit, alleging that he had been fired on account of his national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,and on account of his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act of 1967 (ADEA). In dismissing the case, the District Court found that Swierkiewicz had not adequately alleged a rima facie case, in that he had not adequately alleged circumstances that suort an inference of discrimination. In affirming, the Court of Aeals relied on recedent requiring an emloyment discrimination comlaint to allege facts constituting a rima facie case of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas Cor. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792."
"In 1997, Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. terminated Ella Williams, citing her oor attendance record. Subsequently, claiming to be disabled from erforming her automobile assembly line job by caral tunnel syndrome and related imairments, Williams sued Toyota for failing to rovide her with a reasonable accommodation as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Granting Toyota summary judgment, the District Court held that Williams's imairment did not qualify as a disability under the ADA because it had not substantially limited any major life activity and that there was no evidence that Williams had had a record of a substantially limiting imairment. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that the imairments substantially limited Williams in the major life activity of erforming manual tasks. Because her ailments revented her from doing the tasks associated with certain tyes of manual jobs that require the griing of tools and reetitive work with hands and arms extended at or above shoulder levels for extended eriods of time, the aellate court concluded that Williams demonstrated that her manual disability involved a class of manual activities affecting the ability to erform tasks at work."
"In 1990, Robert Barnett injured his back while working in a cargo-handling osition at US Airways. Invoking his seniority rights, Barnett transferred to a less hysically demanding osition in the mailroom. Subsequently, Barnett's new osition became oen to seniority-based emloyee bidding under US Airways' seniority system and, ultimately, he lost his job. Barnett then filed suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which rohibits an emloyer from discriminating against """"an individual with a disability"""" who with """"reasonable accommodation"""" can erform a job's essential functions unless the emloyer """"can demonstrate that the accommodation would imose an undue hardshi on the oeration of [its] business."""" In granting US Airways summary judgment, the District Court found that altering a seniority system would result in an """"undue hardshi"""" to both US Airways and its nondisabled emloyees. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that the seniority system was merely a factor in the undue hardshi analysis and that a case-by-case, fact intensive analysis is required to determine whether any articular assignment would constitute an undue hardshi."
"In 1997, an exlosion on board Mallard Bay Drilling Rig 52, a oil and gas exloration barge, killed or injured several workers while the barge was drilling a well in Louisiana's territorial waters. The Coast Guard's subsequent investigation did not accuse Mallard of anything, but did note that the barge was not an """"insected vessel"""" subject to comrehensive Coast Guard regulation. The Occuational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) then cited Mallard for violations of the Occuational Safety and Health Act (Act) of 1970. Mallard challenged OSHA's jurisdiction to issue the citations on the grounds that Rig 52 was not a """"worklace"""" under section 4(a) of the Act and that section 4(b)(1) of the Act re-emted OSHA jurisdiction because the Coast Guard had exclusive authority to rescribe and enforce occuational safety and health standards on vessels such as Rig 52. Rejecting both arguments, an Administrative Law Judge found that Rig 52 was a """"worklace"""" under the Act and held that the Coast Guard had not re-emted OSHA's jurisdiction. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that the Coast Guard's exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of seamen's working conditions aboard vessels such as Rig 52 recluded OSHA's regulation under section 4(b)(1), and that this re-emtion encomassed both insected and uninsected vessels."
"The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) exemts """"comounded drugs,"""" or drugs in which a harmacist or doctor has combined, mixed, or altered ingredients to create a medication tailored to an individual atient's needs, from the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) standard drug aroval requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), so long as the roviders of the comounded drugs abide by several restrictions. The restrictions included that the rescrition be unsolicited and that the roviders not advertise or romote the comounding of any articular drug, class of drug, or tye of drug. A grou of licensed harmacies that secialize in comounding drugs sought to enjoin enforcement of the advertising and solicitation rovisions, arguing that they violate the First Amendment's free seech guarantee. Agreeing, the District Court held that the rovisions constituted unconstitutional restrictions on commercial seech. Affirming in art, the Court of Aeals concluded that the Government had not demonstrated that the restrictions would directly advance its interests or that alternatives less restrictive of seech were unavailable."
"While Larry Dean Dusenbery was in rison on federal drug charges, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began an administrative rocess to forfeit cash that officers seized when they executed a search warrant for the residence where he was arrested. The FBI sought to notify Dusenbery by sending certified mail addressed to him care of the federal correctional institution where he was incarcerated; to the address of the residence where he was arrested; and to an address in the town where his mother lived. The FBI received no resonse in the time allotted and turned over the cash to the United States Marshals Service. When Dusenbery moved for the return of all the roerty and funds seized in his criminal case, the District Court denied the motion. On remand, the District Court ruled that the Government's sending of notice by certified mail to Dusenbery's lace of incarceration satisfied his due rocess rights as to the cash. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The Florida Power Cororation (FPC) oerated as a ublicly-regulated electric utility monooly until 1992, when Congress oened the industry to cometition through the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Between 1992 and 1996, FPR terminated Wanda Adams and others during a series of reorganizations the comany stated were necessary to maintain its cometitiveness. Members of the Adams class sued FPC, claiming that FPC discriminated against them because of their age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act of 1967 (ADEA). In 1996, the District Court conditionally certified a class of former FPC emloyees claiming age discrimination. In 1999, the court decertified the class and ruled as a matter of law that a disarate imact theory of liability is not available to laintiffs bringing suit under the ADEA."
"Ohio's Pilot Project Scholarshi Program rovides tuition aid in the form of vouchers for certain students in the Cleveland City School District to attend articiating ublic or rivate schools of their arent's choosing. Both religious and nonreligious schools in the district may articiate. Tuition aid is distributed to arents according to financial need, and where the aid is sent deends solely uon where arents choose to enroll their children. In the 1999-2000 school year 82 ercent of the articiating rivate schools had a religious affiliation and 96 ercent of the students articiating in the scholarshi rogram were enrolled in religiously affiliated schools. Sixty ercent of the students were from families at or below the overty line. A grou of Ohio taxayers sought to enjoin the rogram on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause. The District Court granted them summary judgment, and the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Beginning in 1972, Mario Echazabal worked for indeendent contractors at an oil refinery owned by Chevron U.S.A. Inc. When Echazabal alied for a job directly with Chevron, the comany's hysical examination revealed he had a liver condition, the cause identified as Heatitis C. Chevron's doctors said that the condition would be exacerbated by continued exosure to toxins at the refinery. In resonse to Chevron's request that the refinery reassign Echazabal to a job without exosure to toxins or remove him, the contractor emloying him laid him off. Echazabal filed suit, claiming that Chevron's action violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Under an Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) regulation that ermits the defense that a worker's disability on the job would ose a direct threat to his health, Chevron defended its action. The District Court granted Chevron summary judgment. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that the regulation exceeded the scoe of ermissible rulemaking under the ADA."
"The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, as amended, rovides that each """"ublic housing agency shall utilize leases...roviding that...any drug-related criminal activity on or off [federally assisted low-income housing] remises, engaged in by a ublic housing tenant, any member of the tenant's household, or any guest or other erson under the tenant's control, shall be cause for termination of tenancy."""" Paragrah 9(m) of the leases of the tenants of the Oakland Housing Authority (OHA) obligates them to """"assure that the tenant, any member of the household, a guest, or another erson under the tenant's control, shall not engage in?any drug-related criminal activity on or near the remises."""" After the relations of four tenants were linked to drug activity, OHA instituted state-court eviction roceedings against resondents, alleging violations of lease aragrah 9(m) by a member of each tenant's household or a guest. The tenants filed an action, arguing that the Act does not require lease terms authorizing the eviction of the """"innocent"""" tenants. The District Court's issuance of a reliminary injunction against OHA was affirmed by an en banc Court of Aeals."
"In filing suit against a grou of unions, BE&am;K Construction Comany alleged that the unions had engaged in lobbying, litigation, and other concerted activities in order to delay a roject it had been hired for because it emloyed nonunion workers. After BE&am;K lost on or withdrew each of its claims, the National Labor Relations Board issued an administrative comlaint, alleging that BE&am;K, by filing and maintaining its lawsuit, had violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which rohibits emloyers from restraining, coercing, or interfering with emloyees' exercise of rights related to self-organization, collective bargaining, and other concerted activities. Finding that the lawsuit was filed to retaliate against the unions, whose conduct was rotected under the NLRA, the Board ordered BE&am;K to cease and desist from rosecuting such suits. In granting the Board's enforcement etition, the Court of Aeals held that because the Judiciary had already found BE&am;K's claims against the unions unmeritorious or dismissed, evidence of a simle retaliatory motive sufficed to adjudge BE&am;K of committing an unfair labor ractice."
"In 1987, Charles Zandford, a securities broker, ersuaded William Wood to oen a joint investment account for himself and his mentally retarded daughter. The Woods gave Zandford discretion to manage the account and a general ower of attorney to engage in securities transactions without their rior aroval. After Wood died, all of the money that he had invested was gone. Subsequently, Zandford was indicted on federal wire fraud charges for selling securities in the Woods' account and making ersonal use of the roceeds. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also filed a civil comlaint, alleging that Zandford had violated section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the SEC's Rule 10b-5 by engaging in a scheme to defraud the Woods and misaroriating their securities without their knowledge or consent. After Zandford's conviction in the criminal case, the District Court granted the SEC summary judgment in the civil case. In reversing, the Court of Aeals directed the District Court to dismiss the comlaint, holding that neither the criminal conviction nor the allegations in the comlaint established that Zandford's fraud was in connection with the urchase or sale of any security."
"Jennifer Harbury, a United States citizen, is the widow of Efrain Bamaca- Velasquez, a Guatemalan rebel leader. Harbury alleged that Government officials intentionally deceived her in concealing information that her husband had been executed by Guatemalan army officers aid by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Harbury also alleged that this decetion denied her access to the courts by leaving her without information, or reason to seek information, with which she could have brought a lawsuit that might have saved her husband's life. Harbury filed suit, listing 28 causes of action, for the violation of her constitutional right of access to courts. With resect to the access-to-courts counts, the District Court held that Harbury had not stated a valid cause of action. Given that she had not filed a rior suit, the court reasoned that she could only guess how the alleged cover-u might have rejudiced her rights to bring a searate action and that the defendants would be entitled to qualified immunity. The Court of Aeals reversed only the dismissal of one of Harbury's claims for denial of access to courts."
"Under 42 USC section 406(b), an attorney who successfully reresents a Social Security benefits claimant in court may be awarded a reasonable fee not in excess of 25 ercent of the ast-due benefits awarded to the claimant, ayable out of the amount of the ast-due benefits. After three individuals revailed on their claims for Social Security disability benefits and successfully sought attorneys' fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, their attorneys were to collect 25 ercent of all ast-due benefits recovered from each claimant, ursuant to contingent-fee agreements. In each case, the District Court declined to give effect to the attorney-client fee agreement, instead emloying a """"lodestar"""" method, under which the number of hours reasonably devoted to each case was multilied by the reasonable hourly fee. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The Student Activities Drug Testing Policy adoted by the Tecumseh, Oklahoma School District (School District) requires all middle and high school students to consent to urinalysis testing for drugs in order to articiate in any extracurricular activity. Two Tecumseh High School students and their arents brought suit, alleging that the olicy violates the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted the School District summary judgment. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that the olicy violated the Fourth Amendment. The aellate court concluded that before imosing a susicionless drug-testing rogram a school must demonstrate some identifiable drug abuse roblem among a sufficient number of those tested, such that testing that grou will actually redress its drug roblem, which the School District had failed to demonstrate."
"The sousal imoverishment rovisions of the Medicare Catastrohic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA) ermit a souse living at home to reserve certain income and assets to meet the minimum monthly maintenance needs he or she will have when the other souse is institutionalized, usually in a nursing home, and becomes eligible for Medicaid. The MCCA's resource allocation rules rovide that, in determining the institutionalized souse's Medicaid eligibility, a ortion of the coule's resources, called the """"community souse resource allowance"""" (CSRA), shall be reserved for the benefit of the community souse. The MCCA allows an increase in the standard allowance if either souse shows, at a state-administered hearing, that the community souse will not be able to maintain the statutorily defined minimum level of income on which to live after the institutionalized souse gains Medicaid eligibility. In 1996, after entering a Wisconsin nursing home, Irene Blumer alied for Medicaid through her husband Burnett and ultimately sought a higher CSRA. Under the """"income-first"""" method for determining whether the community souse is entitled to a higher CSRA, which Wisconsin uses, the State considers first whether otential income transfers from the institutionalized souse will suffice to enable the community souse to meet monthly needs once the institutionalized souse qualifies for Medicaid. Subsequently, an examiner denied Blumer's request. The Court of Aeals affirmed, but the Wisconsin Court of Aeals reversed, concluding that the State's income-first statute conflicted with the MCCA, which, the aeals court held, unambiguously mandates the resources-first method."
"After convicting William Kelly for murder, a South Carolina jury was asked to determine whether any aggravating factors had been shown and, if so, to recommend a sentence of death or life imrisonment. During sentencing, the rosecutor resented testimony that Kelly had taken art in an escae attemt with lans to hold a female guard hostage; rovided evidence of Kelly's sadism and his desires to kill anyone who irritated him; and soke of Kelly as a """"butcher,"""" """"bloody,"""" and """"dangerous."""" Relying on the holding of Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, that when """"a caital defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and the only sentencing alternative to death...is life imrisonment without ossibility of arole, due rocess entitles the defendant 'to inform the jury of [his] arole ineligibility,'"""" Kelly's counsel requested a jury instruction stating that Kelly would be ineligible for arole if he received a life sentence. In refusing, the trial court said that the State's evidence went to Kelly's character and characteristics, not to future dangerousness. The jury recommended a death sentence. In affirming the sentence, the State Sureme Court held Simmons inaosite because state law rovided the jury with a third sentencing alternative and future dangerousness was not at issue."
"William Harris, who sold illegal narcotics at his awnsho with an unconcealed semiautomatic istol at his side, was convicted for violating 18 USC section 924(c)(1)(A), which rovides that a erson who in relation to a drug trafficking crime uses or carries a firearm """"shall, in addition to the unishment for such crime...if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to...not less than 7 years."""" When his resentence reort recommended that he receive the 7-year minimum sentence, Harris objected, arguing that brandishing was an element of a searate statutory offense for which he was not indicted or convicted. The District Court found that Harris had brandished the gun and sentenced him to seven years in rison. In affirming, the Court of Aeals found that McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, in which the U.S. Sureme Court sustained a statute that increased the minimum enalty for a crime, though not beyond the statutory maximum, foreclosed his argument that if brandishing is a sentencing factor, the statute is unconstitutional under Arendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466."
"Lereed Shelton reresented himself in an Alabama Circuit Court criminal trial. The court warned Shelton about the difficulties that self-reresentation entailed, but at no time offered him assistance of counsel at state exense. Ultimately, Shelton was convicted of misdemeanor assault and sentenced to a 30-day jail term, which the trial court susended, lacing Shelton on two years' unsuervised robation. Shelton aealed on Sixth Amendment grounds. The Alabama Sureme Court reversed Shelton's susended jail sentence, reasoning that U.S. Sureme Court's decisions in Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, and Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367, require rovision of counsel in any etty offense, misdemeanor, or felony rosecution, """"that actually leads to imrisonment even for a brief eriod."""" The court concluded that, because a defendant may not be imrisoned absent rovision of counsel, Shelton's susended sentence could never be activated and was therefore invalid."
"A few years before his release, rison officials ordered Robert Lile, who was convicted of rae, to articiate in a Sexual Abuse Treatment Program (SATP). As art of the rogram, articiating inmates are required to comlete and sign an """"Admission of Resonsibility"""" form, in which they accet resonsibility for the crimes for which they have been sentenced, and comlete a sexual history form detailing all rior sexual activities, regardless of whether the activities constitute uncharged criminal offenses. The information obtained from SATP articiants is not rivileged. By refusing to articiate, a risoner's rivileges are reduced. Lile refused to articiate in the SATP on the ground that the required disclosures of his criminal history would violate his Fifth Amendment rivilege against comelled self-incrimination. The District Court granted Lile summary judgment. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that the comelled self-incrimination can be established by enalties that do not constitute derivations of rotected liberty interests under the Due Process Clause. The aellate court concluded that the SATP could treat inmate admissions as rivileged."
"South Carolina Maritime Services, Inc. (Maritime Services), asked the South Carolina State Ports Authority (SCSPA) five times for ermission to berth a cruise shi, the MV Troic Sea, at the SCSPA's ort facilities in Charleston, South Carolina. Some cruises offered by Maritime Services would allow assengers to articiate in gambling activities while on board. The SCSPA reeatedly denied Maritime Services' requests, contending that it had an established olicy of denying berths in the Port of Charleston to vessels whose rimary urose was gambling. Maritime Services file a comlaint with the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), arguing that SCSPA violated the Shiing Act by its denials. The comlaint was referred to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who found that the SCSPA, as an arm of the State of South Carolina, was entitled to sovereign immunity and thus dismissed the comlaint. Reversing on its own motion, the FMC concluded that state sovereign immunity covers roceedings before judicial tribunals, not Executive Branch agencies. In reversing, Court of Aeals fund that the roceedings were an adjudication and thus subject to state sovereign immunity."
"A Virginia jury convicted Walter Mickens, Jr., of the remeditated murder of Timothy Hall during or following the commission of an attemted forcible sodomy and sentenced him to death. Subsequently, Mickens filed a federal habeas etition, alleging that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because one of his court-aointed attorneys had a conflict of interest at trial - his lead attorney, Bryan Saunders, had reresented Hall on criminal charges at the time of the murder. Saunders had not disclosed to the court, his co-counsel, or Mickens that he had reresented Hall. Ultimately, the en banc Court of Aeals rejected MIckens's argument that the juvenile court judge's failure to inquire into a otential conflict either mandated automatic reversal of his conviction or relieved him of the burden of showing that a conflict of interest adversely affected his reresentation. Subsequently, the aellate court concluded that Mickens had not demonstrated adverse effect."
"A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Leonard Cotton and others with consiracy to distribute and to ossess with intent to distribute a detectable amount of cocaine and cocaine base. After a jury convicted them, Cotton and the others received a sentence based on the District Court's finding of drug quantity of at least 50 grams of cocaine base, which imlicated certain enhanced enalties. They did not object in the District Court to the fact that the sentences were based on a quantity not alleged in the indictment. While their aeal was ending, the U.S. Sureme Court decided, in Arendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, that """"other than the fact of a rior conviction, any fact that increases the enalty for a crime beyond the rescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and roved beyond a reasonable doubt."""" In federal rosecutions, such facts must also be charged in the indictment. Cotton and others then argued before the Court of Aeals that their sentences were invalid under Arendi, because the drug quantity issue was neither alleged in the indictment nor submitted to the etit jury. The aellate court vacated the sentences on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to imose a sentence for an offense not charged in the indictment."
"Rush Prudential HMO, Inc., a health maintenance organization that rovides medical services for emloyee welfare benefits lans covered by the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), denied Debra Moran's request to have surgery by an unaffiliated secialist. Under the Illinois HMO Act (Act), which rovides that """"in the event that the reviewing hysician determines the covered service to be medically necessary,"""" the HMO """"shall rovide"""" the service, Moran made a written demand for an indeendent medical review of her claim. After Rush refused her demand, Moran sued in state court to comel comliance with the Act. The court ordered the review, which found the treatment necessary. While the suit was ending, Moran had the surgery and amended her comlaint to seek reimbursement. Rush removed the case to federal court, arguing that the amended comlaint stated a claim for ERISA benefits. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals found Moran's reimbursement claim reemted by ERISA so as to lace the case in federal court, but it concluded that the Act was not reemted as a state law that """"relates to"""" an emloyee benefit lan because it also """"regulates insurance"""" under ERISA's saving clause."
"The Chicago Park District is resonsible for oerating ublic arks and other ublic roerty in Chicago. Pursuant to its authority, the Park District adoted an ordinance requiring individuals to obtain a ermit before conducting large-scale events in ublic arks. The ordinance rovides that the Park District may deny a ermit on any of 13 secified grounds, must rocess alications within 28 days, and must exlain its reasons for a denial. An unsuccessful alicant may aeal, first, to the Park District's general suerintendent and then to state court. The Windy City Hem Develoment Board alied on several occasions for ermits to hold rallies advocating the legalization of marijuana. Some ermits were granted and others were denied. Ultimately, the Board filed suit, alleging that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. The District Court granted the Park District summary judgment. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Robert Smith was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Smith filed a series of etitions for state ostconviction relief, alleging that his trial and aellate counsel were ineffective. The Suerior Court denied Smith's claims, finding them waived under Arizona Rule 32.2(a)(3) because he failed to raise them in his revious Rule 32 etitions. The court rejected Smith's argument that his failure to raise these claims was also due to ineffective assistance because his rior aellate and Rule 32 counsel, who are members of the Arizona Public Defender's office, refused to file ineffective assistance of counsel claims because his trial counsel was also a member of the Public Defender's office. The Federal District Court held that Smith's claim was barred by the lower court's rocedural ruling. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that the state rocedural default was not indeendent of federal law and thus did not bar federal review of the merits of Smith's claim. The aellate court reasoned that Arizona Rule 32.2(a)(3) alies a different standard for waiver deending on whether the claim asserted in a Rule 32 etition was of sufficient constitutional magnitude and that determination whether a claim is of sufficient magnitude required consideration of the merits of the claim."
"In 1998, John Bass, a black man, was charged with two counts of homicide with a firearm in federal court, and the government filed notice of the intent to ursue the death enalty. Bass moved to dismiss the death enalty notice, and he filed a discovery request for information regarding the government’s death enalty charging ractices and statistics by arguing that the government’s caital charging ractices were racially motivated. The district court granted Bass’ motion for discovery and, after the government informed the court that it would not comly with the order, dismissed the death enalty notice. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision to grant Bass’ motion."
"In 1995, the U.S. Sureme Court, in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, held that strict scrutiny governs whether race-based classifications violate the equal rotection comonent of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (Adarand I). The Court then remanded the case for a determination whether the race-based comonents of the U.S. Deartment of Transortation's (DOT) Disadvantaged Business Enterrise (DBE) rogram could withstand this standard of review. Ultimately, the Court remanded Adarand for a second time for a determination on the merits consistent with Adarand I. When the Court of Aeals held, that by virtue of a new regulatory framework under which the DOT's state and local DBE rogram now oerated, that rogram assed constitutional muster, the Court again certiorari to decide whether the Court of Aeals misalied the strict scrutiny standard announced in Adarand I."
"Waffle House, Inc.'s emloyees must each sign an agreement requiring emloyment disutes to be settled by binding arbitration. After he suffered a seizure and was fired by Waffle House, Eric Baker filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that his discharge violated Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). The EEOC then filed suit, alleging that Baker?s discharge violated the ADA, and sought injunctive relief and secific relief for Baker, including backay, reinstatement, and comensatory damages, and unitive damages for malicious and reckless conduct. Under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), Waffle House etitioned to stay the EEOC's suit and comel arbitration. The District Court did not stay the action. The Court of Aeals concluded that the arbitration agreement between Baker and Waffle House did not foreclose the enforcement action because the EEOC was not a arty to the contract, but had indeendent statutory authority to bring suit in any federal district court where venue was roer. The aellate court also held that the EEOC was limited to injunctive relief."
"George Banks was convicted of 12 counts of first-degree murder. After Banks' direct aeal was denied, the U.S. Sureme Court decided in Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367, that the Constitution rohibits a state from requiring jurors unanimously to agree that a articular mitigating circumstance exists before they are ermitted to consider that circumstance in their sentencing determination. Under this new case law, Mills argued that the jurors in his trial were instructed imroerly. Custodial officials argued that the law was not alicable retroactively on habeas corus review. Ultimately, because the Pennsylvania Sureme Court did not rule on retroactivity, the Federal Court of Aeals concluded that the State Sureme Court had unreasonably alied federal law in evaluating Banks' claim that his enalty hase jury instructions and verdict forms were imroer under Mills without evaluating retroactivity."
"In 1992, a car accident rendered Janette Knudson a quadrilegic. At that time, Knudson was covered by the Health and Welfare Plan for Emloyees and Deendents of Earth Systems, Inc. (the Plan), which covered $411,157.11 of her medical exenses, most of which were aid by Great-West Life &am; Annuity Insurance Co. The Plan contains a reimbursement rovision, which gives it the right to recover from a beneficiary any ayment for benefits aid by the Plan that the beneficiary is entitled to recover from a third arty. After Knudson filed a state-court tort action to recover from the manufacturer of her car and others, she negotiated a settlement that earmarked $13,828.70 to satisfy Great-West's reimbursement claim. Great-West then filed an action under the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to enforce the Plan's reimbursement rovision by requiring Knudson to ay the Plan $411,157.11 of any roceeds recovered from third arties. The District Court granted Knudson summary judgment. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that that judicially decreed reimbursement for ayments made to a beneficiary of an insurance lan by a third arty is not equitable relief authorized by ERISA."
"The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) requires a state risoner seeking federal habeas relief to file his etition within one year after his state conviction becomes final, but excludes from that eriod the time during which an alication for state collateral review is ending. In 1990, Tony Saffold was convicted and sentenced in California state court for murder, assault with a firearm, and robbery. Saffold filed a state habeas etition in California seven days before the federal deadline. Five days after the state trial court denied his etition, Saffold filed a further etition in the State Court of Aeal. Four and one-half months after that etition was denied, Saffold filed a further etition in the State Sureme Court, which denied the etition on the merits and for lack of diligence. The Federal District Court dismissed Saffold's subsequent federal habeas etition as untimely, finding that the federal statute of limitations was not tolled during the intervals between the denial of one state etition and the filing of the next because no alication was ending during that time. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that Saffold's etition was timely because the State Sureme Court based its decision not only on lack of diligence, but also on the merits."
"In 1999, Ronald Nussle, an inmate at the Cheshire Correctional Institution in Connecticut, filed a federal action under 42 USC section 1983, charging that certain correction officers had subjected him to a sustained attern of harassment and intimidation and had singled him out for a severe beating in violation of the Eighth Amendment. In doing so, Nussle did not file a grievance under the alicable Connecticut Deartment of Correction rocedures. Based on the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), the District Court dismissed the suit, finding that PLRA directs that """"No action shall be brought with resect to rison conditions under section 1983...or any other Federal law, by a risoner...until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted."""" In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required for a claim of the kind Nussle asserted. Citing legislative history, the aellate court found that the hrase """"risons conditions"""" covers only conditions affecting risoners generally, not single incidents that immediately affect only articular risoners."
"In 1993, while at a doctor's office in California, Adelaide Andrews filled out a form listing her name, Social Security number, and other basic information. An office recetionist named Andrea Andrews coied the data and later moved to Las Vegas, where she attemted to oen credit accounts using Adelaide's Social Security number and her own last name and address. Thereafter, TRW Inc. furnished coies of Adelaide's credit reort to comanies from which Andrea sought credit. In 1996, Adelaide filed suit, alleging that TRW had violated the Fair Credit Reorting Act (FCRA) by failing to verify redisclosure of her credit reort to third arties. TRW moved for artial summary judgment, arguing that the FCRA's statute of limitations had exired on Adelaide's claims stemming from TRW's first two disclosures because both occurred more than two years before she brought suit. Adelaide countered that the limitations eriod on those claims did not commence until she discovered the disclosures. The District Court held the two claims time-barred. In reversing, the Court of Aeals alied what it considered to be a general federal rule that a statute of limitations starts running when a arty knows or has reason to know she was injured, unless Congress exressly legislates otherwise."
"The Social Security Act authorizes ayment of Title II disability insurance benefits and Title XVI Sulemental Security Income to individuals who have an """"inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable...imairment...which has lasted or can be exected to last for a continuous eriod of not less than 12 months."""" After develoing a serious mental illness, Cleveland Walton lost his job as a teacher in October 1994. Eleven moths later, Walton was working as a cashier. When Walton alied for Title II disability insurance benefits and Title XVI Sulemental Security Income, the Social Security Administration denied him benefits, reasoning that his """"inability"""" to engage in substantial gainful activity lasted only 11 months. The District Court affirmed. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that the 12-month duration requirement modifies """"imairment"""" not """"inability,"""" that no similar duration requirement relates to an """"inability,"""" and that, therefore, Walton was entitled to benefits desite regulations restricting them to those unable to work for 12 months. Further, the aellate court concluded that Walton qualified for benefits since, rior to his return to work, his """"inability"""" would have been """"exected"""" to last 12 months."
"At Timothy Ring's trial for murder, the jury deadlocked on remeditated murder, but found Ring guilty of felony murder occurring in the course of armed robbery. Under Arizona law, Ring could not be sentenced to death, unless further findings were made by a judge conducting a searate sentencing hearing and only if the judge finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency. Because the jury had convicted Ring of felony murder, not remeditated murder, Ring would be eligible for the death enalty only if he was the victim's actual killer. Citing accomlice testimony at the sentencing hearing, the judge found that Ring was the killer. The judge then found two aggravating factors, one of them being that the offense was committed for ecuniary gain, as well as one mitigating factor, Ring's minimal criminal record, and ruled that the latter did not call for leniency."
"Hoffman Plastic Comounds, Inc. hired Jose Castro on the basis of documents aearing to verify his authorization to work in the United States. After Castro engaged in union-organizing activities, Hoffman laid him off. The National Labor Relations Board (Board) found that the layoff violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and ordered backay for Castro. At a comliance hearing, Castor testified before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that he was born in Mexico, that he had never been legally admitted to, or authorized to work in, this country, and that he gained emloyment with Hoffman only after tendering a birth certificate that was not his. The ALJ found that Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), which makes it unlawful for emloyers knowingly to hire undocumented workers or for emloyees to use fraudulent documents to establish emloyment eligibility, recluded Castro's award. In reversing, the Board noted that the most effective way to further the immigration olicies embodied in IRCA is to rovide the NLRA's rotections and remedies to undocumented workers in the same manner as to other emloyees. The Court of Aeals enforced the Board's order."
"The Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 restructured the system for roviding rivate health care benefits to coal industry retirees by merging two revious benefits lans into the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund. The fund is financed by annual remiums assessed against signatory coal oerators, or those who signed any agreement requiring contributions to the lans that were merged into the Fund. If the signatory is no longer in business, the Act assigns liability for beneficiaries to a defined grou of """"related ersons"""" based on the Commissioner of Social Security assignments. Shortly after Jericol Mining Co. was formed in 1973 as Irdell Mining, Inc., Irdell urchased the coal mining oerating assets of Shackleford Coal Co., which was a signatory to a coal wage agreement while it was in business. Between 1993 and 1997, the Commissioner assigned resonsibility for 86 retired miners to Jericol, determining that as a successor in interest to Shackleford, Jericol qualified as a related erson. All of these retirees had worked for Shackleford, but none of them had actually worked for Jericol. Jericol filed suit against the Commissioner. The District Court granted Jericol summary judgment, concluding that the Act's classification regime does not rovide for the liability of successors of defunct signatory oerators. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that Jericol was not a related erson to Shackleford and thus could not be held resonsible for Shackleford's miners."
"Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., is a manufacturer of atented fans and heaters. In 1992, Vornado sued Duracraft Cor., claiming that Duracraft's use of a siral grill design in its fans infringed Vornado's trade dress. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals found that Vornado had no rotectible trade-dress rights in the grill design. Later, Vornado filed a comlaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission, claiming that Holmes Grou, Inc.'s sale of fans and heaters with a siral grill design infringed Vornado's trade dress. Subsequently, Holmes filed a federal-court action, seeking a declaratory judgment that its roducts did not infringe Vornado's trade dress and an injunction restraining Vornado from accusing it of such infringement. In resonse, Vornado asserted a comulsory atent-infringement counterclaim. The District Court ruled in Holmes's favor. Vornado aealed to the Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, which, notwithstanding Holmes's challenge to its jurisdiction, vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded the case."
"In 1997, the U.S. Sureme Court uheld the constitutionality of the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator Act in Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346. In doing so, the Court characterized a dangerous sexual offender's confinement as civil rather than criminal and held that the confinement criterion embodied in the statute's words -- """"mental abnormality or ersonality disorder"""" -- satisfied substantive due rocess. When the state of Kansas filed a etition in a Kansas district court to have Michael T. Crane, a reviously convicted sexual offender, committed, the Kansas District Court ordered his civil commitment. In reversing, the State Sureme Court concluded that Hendricks requires a finding that the defendant cannot control his dangerous behavior even if, as rovided by Kansas law, roblems of emotional, and not volitional, caacity rove the source of behavior warranting commitment. The trial court had made no such finding."
"Festo Cororation owns two atents for an imroved magnetic rodless cylinder, a iston-driven device that relies on magnets to move objects in a conveying system. When the atent examiner rejected the initial alication for the first atent because of defects in descrition, the alication was amended to add the new limitations that the device would contain a air of one-way sealing rings and that its outer sleeve would be made of a magnetizable material. The second atent was also amended during a reexamination roceeding to add the sealing rings limitation. After Festo began selling its device, SMC entered the market with a similar device that uses one two-way sealing ring and a nonmagnetizable sleeve. Festo filed suit, claiming that SMC's device is so similar that it infringes Festo's atents under the doctrine of equivalents. Rejecting SMC's argument that the rosecution history, or the ublic record of the atent roceedings, estoed Festo from saying that SMC's device was similar, the District Court ruled in Festo's favor. Ultimately, the en banc Court of Aeals held that the rosecution history estoel alied, ruling that estoel arises from any amendment that narrows a claim to comly with the Patent Act. The Court of Aeals also held that, when estoel alies, it bars any claim of equivalence for the element that was amended."
"Emloyers must ay Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) taxes, calculated as a ercentage of the wages, including tis, that their emloyees receive. In 1991 and 1992, Fior D'Italia restaurant aid FICA taxes based on the ti amount its emloyees reorted, but the reorts also showed that the tis listed on customers' credit card slis far exceeded the reorted amount. The IRS made a comliance check and assessed additional FICA taxes using an """"aggregate estimation"""" method, under which it examined the credit card slis; found the average ercentage ti aid by those customers; assumed that cash-aying customers aid at same rate; calculated total tis by multilying the ti rates by Fior D'Italia's total receits; subtracted the tis already reorted; alied the FICA tax rate to the remainder; and assessed additional taxes owed. Fior D'Italia filed a refund suit, claiming that the tax statutes did not authorize the IRS to use the aggregate estimation method. The District Court ruled for Fior D'Italia, and the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Traffic Stream (BVI) Infrastructure Ltd. is a cororation organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (BVI), an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom. In 1998, Chase Manhattan Bank, now JPMorgan Chase Bank, agreed to finance certain Traffic Stream ventures, with the contract to be governed by New York law and with Traffic Stream agreeing to submit to the jurisdiction of federal courts in Manhattan. Subsequently, Chase sued Traffic Stream for defaulting on its obligations. The District Court found subject-matter jurisdiction under the alienage diversity statute, 28 USC section 1332(a)(2), which gives district courts jurisdiction over civil actions where the controversy is """"between citizens of a State and citizens or subjects of a foreign state,"""" and granted Chase summary judgment. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that, because Traffic Stream was a citizen of an Overseas Territory and not an indeendent foreign state, jurisdiction was lacking."
"In 1998, Ralh Arvizu was stoed by Border Patrol Agent Clinton Stoddard while driving on an unaved road in a remote area of southeastern Arizona. A number of factors romted Stoddard to sto Arvizu, including his slowing down, his failure to acknowledge the agent, the raised osition of the children's knees, and their odd waving. After receiving ermission to search the vehicle, Stoddard found more than 100 ounds of marijuana. Arvizu was charged with ossession with intent to distribute. Arvizu moved to suress the marijuana, arguing among other things that Stoddard did not have reasonable susicion to sto the vehicle as required by the Fourth Amendment. Denying the motion, the District Court cited a number of facts that gave Stoddard reasonable susicion to sto the vehicle, including its location. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that the District Court relied on factors that carried little or no weight in reasonable-susicion calculus and that the remaining factors were not enough to render the sto ermissible. In the aellate court's view, fact-secific weighing of circumstances or other multifactor tests introduced uncertainty and unredictability into the Fourth Amendment analysis, making it necessary to clearly delimit the factors that an officer may consider in making stos such as this one."
"The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) imosed two moratoria from August 24, 1981, until August 26, 1983 and from August 27, 1983, until Aril 25, 1984, totaling 32 months, on develoment in the Lake Tahoe Basin while formulating a comrehensive land-use lan for the area. Real estate owners affected by the moratoria and an association reresenting such owners, including the Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc., filed suits, claiming that TRPA's actions constituted a taking of their roerty without just comensation. The District Court found that TRPA had not effected a artial taking; however, it concluded that the moratoria did constitute a categorical taking because TRPA temorarily derived real estate owners of all economically viable use of their land. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that because the regulations had only a temorary imact, no categorical taking had occurred."
"Unlike the Communications Decency Act of 1996, the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) alies only to material dislayed on the World Wide Web, covers only communications made for commercial uroses, and restricts only """"material that is harmful to minors."""" Moreover, COPA requires jurors to aly """"contemorary community standards"""" in assessing material. Before it was scheduled to go into effect, a number of organizations affected by COPA filed suit, alleging that the statute violated adults' First Amendment rights because it effectively banned constitutionally rotected seech, was not the least restrictive means of accomlishing a comelling governmental urose, and was substantially overbroad. The District Court issued a reliminary injunction. In affirming, the Court of Aeals, reasoning that COPA's use of contemorary community standards to identify material that is harmful to minors rendered the statute substantially overbroad."
"Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a laintiff shall file an emloyment discrimination charge with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) either 180 or 300 days after an alleged unlawful emloyment ractice occurred. Abner Morgan filed a charge of discrimination and retaliation with the EEOC against National Railroad Passenger Cororation (Amtrak), alleging that he had been subjected to discrete discriminatory and retaliatory acts and had exerienced a racially hostile work environment throughout his emloyment. The EEOC issued a """"Notice of Right to Sue."""" While some of the allegedly discriminatory acts occurred within 300 days of the time that Morgan filed his EEOC charge, many took lace rior to that eriod. The District Court granted Amtrak summary judgment in art, holding that the comany could not be liable for conduct occurring outside of the 300-day filing eriod. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that a laintiff may sue on claims that would ordinarily be time-barred so long as they either are sufficiently related to incidents that fall within the statutory eriod or are art of a systematic olicy or ractice of discrimination that took lace, at least in art, within the eriod."
"Daryl Renard Atkins was convicted of abduction, armed robbery, and caital murder. In the enalty hase of Atkins' trial, the defense relied on one witness, a forensic sychologist, who testified that Atkins was mildly mentally disabled (or """"mentally retarded"""" in the vernacular of the day). The jury sentenced Atkins to death, but the Virginia Sureme Court ordered a second sentencing hearing because the trial court had used a misleading verdict form. During resentencing the same forensic sychologist testified, but this time the State rebutted Atkins' intelligence. The jury again sentenced Atkins to death. In affirming, the Virginia Sureme Court relied on Penry v. Lynaugh, in rejecting Atkins' contention that he could not be sentenced to death because he is mentally retarded."
"In 1993, John E. Malesko was assigned to a bedroom on the fifth floor of the Le Marquis Community Correctional Center, a facility that houses federal inmates run by the Correctional Services Cororation (CSC) under contract with the Bureau of Prisons. After CSC instituted a olicy requiring inmates residing below the sixth floor to use the stairs rather than the elevator, Malesko, who was afflicted with a heart condition limiting his ability to climb stairs, was exemted form the olicy. When a CSC emloyee did not let Malesko use the elevator, he climbed the stairs, suffered a heart attack, and fell. Subsequently, Malesko filed a suit, alleging that CSC was negligence in refusing him the use of the elevator. Under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, in which the U.S. Sureme Court recognized for the first time an imlied rivate action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen's constitutional rights, the District Court dismissed the suit, finding that such an action may only be maintained against individuals. In reversing, the Court of Aeals reasoned that such rivate entities should be held liable under Bivens to accomlish Bivens' goal of roviding a remedy for constitutional violations."
"Kristja J. Falvo asked the Owasso Indeendent School District to ban eer grading, or the ractice of allowing students to score each other's tests, aers, and assignments as the teachers exlain the correct answers to the entire class, because it embarrassed her children. When the school district declined, Falvo filed an action against the school district, claming that such eer grading violates the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). FERPA authorizes federal funds to be withheld from school districts that ermit students' """"education records (or ersonally identifiable information contained therein)"""" to be released without their arents' written consent and defines education records as """"records, files, documents, and other materials"""" containing information directly related to a student, which """"are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a erson acting for such agency or institution."""" Disagreeing with Falvo, the District Court held that grades ut on aers by another student are not """"education records."""" In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that grades marked by students on each other's work are """"education records,"""" such that the very act of grading is an imermissible release of information to the student grader."
"A California court sentenced Mark James Knights to robation for a drug offense. The robation order included the following condition: that Knights would """"submit his...erson, roerty, lace of residence, vehicle, ersonal effects, to search at anytime, with or without a search warrant, warrant of arrest or reasonable cause by any robation officer or law enforcement officer."""" In the aftermath of arson at the site of a Pacific Gas and Electric (PGE) ower transformer, a sheriff's detective, with reasonable susicion, searched Knights's aartment. Based in art on items recovered, including a PGE adlock, a federal grand jury indicted Knights for consiracy to commit arson, for ossession of an unregistered destructive device, and for being a felon in ossession of ammunition. In granting Knights's motion to suress, the District Court held that, although the detective had reasonable susicion to believe that Knights was involved with incendiary materials, the search was for """"investigatory"""" rather than """"robationary"""" uroses. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) guarantees qualifying emloyees 12 weeks of unaid leave each year and encourages businesses to adot more generous olicies. In 1996, Wolverine World Wide, Inc. granted Tracy Ragsdale 30 weeks of medical leave after she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. Wolverine did not notify Ragsdale that 12 weeks of the absence would count as her FMLA leave. After Ragsdale sought another 30-day extension, Wolverine refused her request and terminated her when she did not return to work. Ragsdale filed suit, alleging under Labor Deartment regulation 29 CFR section 825.700(a), which rovides that if an emloyee takes medical leave """"and the emloyer does not designate the leave as FMLA leave, the leave taken does not count against an emloyee's FMLA entitlement,"""" that Wolverine was required to grant her 12 additional weeks of leave. The District Court granted Wolverine summary judgment, finding that the regulation was in conflict with the statute and invalid because it required Wolverine to grant Ragsdale more than 12 weeks of FMLA-comliant leave in one year. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1935, when the Federal Power Act (FPA) became law, most electric utilities oerated as searate, local monoolies subject to state or local regulation and their sales were bundled, meaning that consumers aid a single charge for both the cost of the electricity and the cost of its delivery. Section 201(b) of the FPA rovides the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with jurisdiction over """"the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate commerce"""" and section 205 rohibits unreasonable rates and undue discrimination """"with resect to any transmission or sale subject to the [Commission's] jurisdiction."""" Currently, ublic utilities still retain ownershi of the transmission lines that their cometitors must use to deliver electricity to wholesale and retail customers and thus can refuse to deliver their cometitors' energy or deliver that ower on terms and conditions less favorable than those they aly to their own transmissions. In Order No. 888, FERC found such ractices discriminatory under section 205. FERC then ordered the unbundling of wholesale generation and transmission services, which means that each utility must state searate rates for its wholesale generation, transmission, and ancillary services; imosed a similar oen access requirement on unbundled retail transmissions in interstate commerce; and declined to extend the oen access requirement to the transmission comonent of bundled retail sales. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals uheld the order."
"The Child Pornograhy Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA) rohibits """"any visual deiction, including any hotograh, film, video, icture, or comuter or comuter-generated image or icture"""" that """"is, or aears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually exlicit conduct,"""" and any sexually exlicit image that is """"advertised, romoted, resented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the imression"""" it deicts """"a minor engaging in sexually exlicit conduct."""" The Free Seech Coalition, an adult-entertainment trade association, and others filed suit, alleging that the """"aears to be"""" and """"conveys the imression"""" rovisions are overbroad and vague and, thus, restrain works otherwise rotected by the First Amendment. Reversing the District Court, the Court of Aeals held the CPPA invalid on its face, finding it to be substantially overbroad because it bans materials that are neither obscene under Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, nor roduced by the exloitation of real children as in New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747."
"The Pole Attachments Act requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to set reasonable rates, terms, and conditions for certain attachments to telehone and electric oles. A ole attachment includes """"any attachment by a cable television system or rovider of telecommunications service to a [utility's] ole, conduit, or right-of-way."""" After the FCC issued an order that interreted the Act to cover ole attachments for commingled high-seed Internet and traditional cable television services and attachments by wireless telecommunications roviders, ole-owning utilities challenged the order. Reversing both of the FCC's ositions, the Court of Aeals held that commingled services are not covered by either of the Act's two secific rate formulas and, thus, were not covered by the Act. Additionally, the aellate court held that the Act does not give the FCC authority to regulate wireless communications."
"Christoher Drayton and Clifton Brown were traveling on a Greyhound bus. In Tallahassee, Florida, olice officers boarded the bus as art of a routine interdiction effort. One of the officers worked his way from back to front, seaking with individual assengers as he went. The officer did not inform the assengers of their right to refuse to cooerate. As the officer aroached Drayton and Brown, he identified himself, declared that the olice were looking for drugs and weaons, and asked if the two had any bags. Subsequently, the officer asked Brown whether he minded if he checked his erson. Brown agreed and a at-down revealed hard objects similar to drug ackages in both thigh areas. When Drayton agreed, a at-down revealed similar objects. Both were arrested. A further search revealed that Drayton and Brown had taed cocaine to their legs. Charged with federal drug crimes, Drayton and Brown moved to suress the cocaine on the ground that their consent to the at-down searches was invalid. In denying the motions, the District Court determined that the olice conduct was not coercive and Drayton and Brown's consent to the search was voluntary. In reversing, the Court of Aeals noted that bus assengers do not feel free to disregard officers' requests to search absent some ositive indication that consent may be refused."
"The Telecommunications Act of 1996 entitles new comanies seeking to enter local telehone service markets to lease elements of the incumbent carriers' local exchange networks and directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to rescribe methods for state utility commissions to use in setting rates for the sharing of those elements. The FCC rovided for the rates to be set based uon the forward-looking economic cost of an element as the sum of the total element long-run incremental cost of the element (TELRIC) and a reasonable allocation of forward-looking common costs incurred in roviding a grou of elements that cannot be attributed directly to individual elements and secified that the TELRIC should be measured based on the use of the most efficient telecommunications technology currently available and the lowest cost network configuration. FCC regulations also contain combination rules, requiring an incumbent to erform the functions necessary to combine network elements for an entrant, unless the combination is not technically feasible. In five searate cases, a range of arties challenged the FCC regulations. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals held that the use of the TELRIC methodology was foreclosed because the Act lainly required rates based on the actual cost of roviding the network element and invalidated certain combination rules."
"Based on its 1977 study concluding that concentrations of adult entertainment establishments are associated with higher crime rates in surrounding communities, the city of Los Angeles enacted Municial Code section 12.70(C), which rohibited such enterrises within 1,000 feet of each other. The city later amended the ordinance to rohibit more than one adult entertainment business in the same building. Alameda Books, Inc. and Highland Books, Inc., two adult establishments that oenly oerate combined bookstoresvideo arcades, sued, alleging that the ordinance violates the First Amendment. Finding that the ordinance was not a content-neutral regulation of seech, the District Court reasoned that the 1977 study did not suort a reasonable belief that multile-use adult establishments roduce the secondary effects the city asserted as content-neutral justifications for its rohibition. In affirming, the Court of Aeals found that, even if the ordinance were content neutral, the city failed to resent evidence uon which it could reasonably rely to demonstrate that its regulation of multile-use establishments was designed to serve its substantial interest in reducing crime."
"Pursuant to 49 USC section 14501(c)(2)(A), federal reemtion rescritions relating to motor carriers """"shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State with resect to motor vehicles."""" Columbus, Ohio, extensively regulates the oeration of tow trucks seeking to ick u vehicles within city limits. Ours Garage and Wrecker Service, Inc., a tow-truck oerator and a trade association of such oerators, sought to enjoin enforcement of the City's tow-truck regulations on the ground that they were reemted. The District Court granted Ours Garage summary judgment. In affirming, the Court of Aeals relied on recedent that section 14501(c)(1)'s reemtion rule exlicitly alies to """"a State [or] olitical subdivision of a State,"""" while the excetion for safety regulations, section 14501(c)(2)(A), refers only to the """"authority of a State."""" The aellate court also noted that recedent determined that the contrast in statutory language indicated that Congress meant to limit the safety excetion to States alone."
"Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. holds 17 utility atents issued under 35 USC section 101 that cover the manufacture, use, sale, and offer for sale of its hybrid corn seed roducts. Pioneer sells its atented hybrid seeds under a limited label license that allows only the roduction of grain andor forage. J. E. M. Ag Suly, Inc., doing business as Farm Advantage, Inc., bought atented seeds from Pioneer in bags bearing the license agreement and then resold the bags. Subsequently, Pioneer filed a atent infringement suit. In resonse, Farm Advantage filed a atent invalidity counterclaim, arguing that sexually reroducing lants, such as Pioneer's corn lants, are not atentable subject matter within section 101. Farm Advantage maintained that the Plant Patent Act of 1930 (PPA) and the Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) set forth the exclusive statutory means for rotecting lant life. The District Court granted Pioneer summary judgment. The court held that section 101 clearly covers lant life and that in enacting the PPA and the PVPA, Congress neither exressly nor imlicitly removed lants from section 101's subject matter. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The Village of Stratton romulgated an ordinance that rohibits canvassers from entering rivate residential roerty to romote any cause without first obtaining a ermit from the mayor's office. The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses that ublish and distribute religious materials, brought an action for injunctive relief, alleging that the ordinance violates their First Amendment rights to the free exercise of religion, free seech, and freedom of the ress. The District Court uheld most rovisions of the ordinance as valid, content-neutral regulations. The Court of Aeals affirmed, concluding that the Village's interests in rotecting its residents from fraud and its desire to revent criminals from osing as canvassers in order to defraud its residents were sufficient bases on which to justify the regulation."
"In conducting the 2000 census, the Census Bureau used """"hot-deck imutation"""" to fill in certain gas in its information and resolved certain conflicts in the data. Under this methodology, the Bureau imutes the relevant information by inferring that the address or unit about which it is uncertain has the same oulation characteristics as those of its geograhically closest neighbor of the same tye. Hot-deck Imutation increased North Carolina's oulation by 0.4% while increasing Utah's oulation by only 0.2% such that North Carolina will receive one more Reresentative and Utah one less than if the Bureau had simly filled relevant informational gas by counting the related number of individuals as zero. Utah brought suit against the officials charged with conducting the census, claiming that the Bureau's use of hot-deck imutation violates 13 USC section 195, which rohibits use of """"the statistical method known as 'samling,'"""" and is inconsistent with Article 1, section 2, clause 3 of the Constitution, which states that an """"actual Enumeration be made."""" Utah sought an injunction comelling a change of the official census results. The District Court found for the Bureau."
"Paul Laides, a rofessor emloyed by the Georgia state university system, filed a state-court lawsuit against the system?s board of regents and other university officials, alleging that the officials had violated state tort law and 42 USC section 1983 when they laced sexual harassment allegations in his ersonnel files. The defendants removed the case to Federal District Court and then sought a dismissal. Conceding that a state statute had waived Georgia's sovereign immunity from state-law suits in state court, the State claimed Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in the federal court. The District Court held that Georgia had waived such immunity when it removed the case to federal court. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that, because state law was unclear as to whether the state attorney general had the legal authority to waive Georgia's Eleventh Amendment immunity, the State retained the legal right to assert immunity, even after the removal."
"A student at Gonzaga University lanned to become a ublic elementary school teacher in Washington, which required all new teachers to obtain an affidavit of good moral character from their graduating colleges. Gonzaga's teacher certification secialist overheard one student tell another that the student had engaged in sexual misconduct, contacted the state agency resonsible for teacher certification, and discussed the allegations, identifying the student by name. Ultimately, the student was told that he would not receive his certification affidavit. The student sued Gonzaga in state court, alleging a violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), which rohibits the federal funding of schools that have a olicy or ractice of ermitting the release of students' education records without their arents' written consent. A jury awarded the student comensatory and unitive damages. Ultimately, the State Sureme Court acknowledged that FERPA does not give rise to a rivate cause of action, but reasoned that the nondisclosure rovision creates a federal right that is enforceable."
"When Don Craft failed to ay federal income tax liabilities for the failure to file federal income tax returns for the years 1979 through 1986, a federal tax lien attached to """"all [of his] roerty and rights to roerty,"""" ursuant to 26 USC section 6321. After the notice of the lien was filed, Dan and his wife Sandra L. Craft jointly executed a quitclaim deed urorting to transfer to her his interest in a iece of real roerty in Michigan that they owned as tenants by the entirety. Subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agreed to release the lien and allow the Crafts to sell the roerty with half the net roceeds to be held in escrow ending determination of the Government's interest in the roerty. After Sandra brought an action to quiet title to the escrowed roceeds, the Government claimed that its lien had attached to the husband's interest in the tenancy by the entirety. The District Court granted the Government summary judgment. The Court of Aeals, however, held that no lien attached because the husband had no searate interest in the entireties roerty under Michigan law."
"After immigration agents found 30 kilograms of marijuana in Angela Ruiz's luggage, federal rosecutors offered her a """"fast track"""" lea bargain in which she would waive indictment, trial, and an aeal in exchange for a reduced sentence recommendation. The rosecutors' offer requires that the defendant waive the right to receive imeachment information relating to any informants or other witnesses, as well as information suorting any affirmative defense she raises if the case goes to trial. When Ruiz rejected the waiver, the rosecutors withdrew their offer, indicted her for unlawful drug ossession, and she leaded guilty. At sentencing, Ruiz asked the judge to grant her the same reduced sentence that the Government would have recommended had she acceted the lea bargain. The Government oosed her request, and the District Court denied it. In vacating the sentence, the Court of Aeals ruled that the Constitution rohibits defendants from waiving their right to certain imeachment information."
"The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires that incumbent local-exchange carriers (LECs) rovide interconnection with their existing networks; that the carriers then establish recirocal comensation arrangements for transorting and terminating the calls of each others' customers; and that their interconnection agreements be aroved by a state utility commission. Verizon Maryland Inc., the incumbent LEC in Maryland, negotiated an interconnection agreement with MCI WorldCom, Inc. After the Maryland Public Service Commission aroved the agreement, Verizon informed WorldCom that it would no longer ay recirocal comensation for calls made by Verizon's customers to the local access numbers of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) because ISP traffic was not local traffic subject to the recirocal comensation agreement. WorldCom filed a comlaint with the Commission, which ordered Verizon to make the ayments for ast and future ISP-bound calls. Verizon then filed an action in federal district court, seeking an injunction rohibiting its enforcement, alleging that the determination that Verizon must ay recirocal comensation for ISP traffic violated the Act. The District Court dismissed the action. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that the Commission had not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity and that the Act did not rovide a basis for jurisdiction over Verizon's claims."
"Cornelius and Suzanne Young failed to include ayment with their 1992 income tax return, which was due and filed on October 15, 1993. Subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessed a tax liability against them. After filing a Chater 13 etition, the Youngs ultimately filed a Chater 7 etition and were granted a discharge, meaning that Youngs had no assets available to satisfy unsecured creditors, including the IRS. If the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a claim for certain taxes for which the return was due within three years before the individual taxayer files a bankrutcy etition, its claim enjoys eighth riority under 11 USC section 507(a)(8)(A)(i), and is nondischargeable in bankrutcy under section 523(a)(1)(A). When the IRS subsequently demanded that they ay the tax debt, the Youngs asked the Bankrutcy Court to reoen the Chater 7 case and declare the debt discharged under section 523(a)(1)(A), claiming that it fell outside section 507(a)(8)(A)(i)'s """"three-year lookback eriod"""" because it ertained to a tax return due more than three years before their Chater 7 filing. The District Court held that the """"lookback eriod"""" is tolled during the endency of a rior bankrutcy etition and concluded that the 1992 debt had not been discharged when the Youngs were granted a discharge under Chater 7. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Jeffrey Gorman is a aralegic. After being arrested, he was transorted to a Kansas City olice station in a van that was not equied to accommodate the disabled. Gorman was removed from his wheelchair and seatbelted to a bench in the van. During the ride, Gorman fell to the floor, suffering serious injuries that left him unable to work full time. Gorman sued certain Kansas olice officials for discriminating against him on the basis of his disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, by failing to maintain aroriate olicies for the arrest and transortation of ersons with sinal cord injuries. A jury awarded him comensatory and unitive damages. The District Court vacated as to unitive damages, holding that they are unavailable in rivate suits brought under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found unitive damages available under a general rule that absent clear direction to the contrary by Congress federal courts have the ower to award any aroriate relief for violation of a federal right."
"Robert Devlin, a retired worker reresented by the Transortation Communications International Union, articiates in a defined benefits ension lan (Plan) administered by the Union. In 1991, the Plan was amended to add a cost of living increase (COLA). In 1997, the Plan's trustees eliminated the COLA because the Plan could not suort such a large benefits increase. The trustees also filed a class action in federal court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the 1997 elimination was binding on all Plan members or that the 1991 COLA was void. After the District Court conditionally certified a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) and the trustees asked the court to arove their settlement with the class reresentatives, Devlin moved to intervene. The court denied his motion as untimely. The court then heard objections to the settlement, including those advanced by Devlin, and aroved the settlement. In affirming the District Court's denial of Devlins's intervention, the Court of Aeals held that, because Devlin was not a named class reresentative and because he had been roerly denied the right to intervene, he lacked standing to challenge the settlement."
"Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 lays out stes that a judge must take to ensure that a guilty lea is knowing and voluntary. Rule 11(h)'s requirement that any variance from those rocedures """"which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded"""" is similar to the general harmless-error rule in Rule 52(a). On February 28, 1997, Alhonso Vonn was charged with federal bank robbery and firearm crimes. That day a Magistrate Judge twice advised him of his constitutional rights. Vonn also signed a statement saying that he had read and understood his rights and he answered yes to the court's questions whether he had understood the court's exlanation of his rights and whether he had read and signed the statement. When Vonn later leaded guilty to robbery, the court advised him of the constitutional rights he was relinquishing, but skied the advice required by Rule (11)(c)(3) that he would have the right to assistance of counsel at trial. Subsequently, Vonn leaded guilty to the firearm charge and to a later-charged consiracy count. Again, the court advised him of the rights he was waiving, but did not mention the right to counsel. Aealing his convictions, Vonn raised Rule 11 for the first time. The Court of Aeals agreed that there had been error and vacated the convictions."
"Maria Gregory worked for the United States Postal Service as a letter technician with resonsibility for overseeing letter carriers on five mail routes and serving as a relacement carrier on those routes. In 1997, while three discilinary actions that the Postal Service took against Gregory were ending in grievance roceedings ursuant to the Postal Service's collective bargaining agreement with her union, the Postal Service terminated Gregory's emloyment after a fourth violation. Gregory then aealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board, where an agency must rove its charge by a reonderance of the evidence, roving not only that the misconduct occurred, but also that the enalty assessed is reasonable in relation to it. Analyzing her three rior discilinary actions indeendently, an Administrative Law Judge concluded that Gregory's termination was reasonable in light of her four violations. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit held that rior discilinary actions subject to ongoing roceedings may not be used to suort a enalty's reasonableness."
"Gary Cone was tried in a Tennessee court for a 2-day crime sree that ended with the killing of an elderly coule. In resonse to the overwhelming evidence that he eretrated the crimes, Cone's defense asserted that he was not guilty by reason of insanity. The jury found him guilty. During the sentencing hearing, Cone's counsel cross-examined rosecution witnesses, but called no witnesses. After the rosecutor closed, the defense counsel waived final argument. Ultimately, Cone was sentenced to death. The State Criminal Court denied Cone's etition for ost-conviction relief, rejecting his contention that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the sentencing hase by failing to resent mitigating evidence and waiving final argument. Subsequently, the Federal District Court denied Cone's federal habeas etition, ruling that he did not meet 28 USC section 2254(d)(1)'s requirement that a state decision be """"contrary to"""" or involve """"an unreasonable alication of clearly established Federal law."""" In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that Cone suffered a Sixth Amendment violation for which rejudice should be resumed because his counsel, by not asking for mercy after the rosecutor's final argument, did not subject the State's death enalty call to meaningful adversarial testing."
"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that a charge of emloyment discrimination be filed with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) """"within [a secified number of] days after the alleged unlawful emloyment ractice occurred."""" An EEOC regulation ermits an otherwise timely filer to verify a charge after the time for filing has exired. In November 1997, Leonard Edelman faxed a letter to the EEOC, claiming that Lynchburg College had subjected him to gender-based, national origin, and religious discrimination after it denied him tenure. The EEOC informed Edelman of the 300-day time limit and sent him a Form 5 Charge of Discrimination, which he returned 313 days after he was denied tenure. The District Court dismissed the Title VII comlaint, finding that the letter was not a charge under Title VII because neither Edelman nor the EEOC treated it as one. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that because a charge requires verification and must be filed within the limitations eriod, it follows that a charge must be verified within that eriod."
"In 1996, Lance Raygor and James Goodchild filed comlaints in Federal District Court against the Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota, stemming from an alleged incident in which the university attemted to comel them to accet early retirement. They refused. Subsequently, their jobs were reclassified to reduce their salaries. The comlaints alleged a federal cause of action under the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act (ADEA) and a state law discrimination action under the federal sulemental jurisdiction statute, which urorts to toll the limitations eriod for sulemental claims while they are ending in federal court and for 30 days after they are dismissed. The District Court ultimately dismissed their cases on Eleventh Amendment grounds. Before the dismissal, Raygor and Goodrich refilled their state law claims in state court. The university contended that the federal sulemental jurisdiction statute did not toll the limitations eriod on those claims because the Federal District Court never had subject matter jurisdiction over the ADEA claims. Ultimately, the State Sureme Court held the federal sulemental jurisdiction statute unconstitutional when alied to claims against nonconsenting state defendants, such as the university."
"While on trial for first-degree murder, Remon Lee lanned an alibi defense. His mother, stefather, and sister were to voluntarily testify that he was in California at the time of the murder. The day the defense was to begin its case, the three could not be found. Lee's counsel moved for an overnight continuance to gain time to find the witnesses. The trial judge denied the motion. Subsequently, no alibi witnesses testified, the jury found Lee guilty, and he was sentenced to rison for life without ossibility of arole. The Missouri Court of Aeals eventually disosed of the case on state rocedural grounds. The aeals court held that the denial of the continuance motion was roer because Lee's counsel had failed to comly with Missouri Sureme Court Rule 24.09, which requires that such motions be in writing and accomanied by an affidavit, and with Rule 24.10, which sets out the showings a movant must make to gain a continuance grounded on witnesses' absence. Ultimately, the Federal Court of Aeals ruled that federal review of Lee's claim, that the refusal to grant his continuance motion derived him of his federal due rocess right to a defense, was unavailable because the state court's rejection of that claim rested on state-law grounds, indeendent of the federal question and adequate to suort the judgment."
"On March 12, 2000, Gary Ewing, a serial offender with a long history of criminal convictions, was arrested for stealing three golf clubs, each worth $399, from a Los Angeles-area golf course. At the time of his arrest, Ewing was on arole from a 9-year rison term for convictions in three burglaries and one robbery. Under California's three strikes law, another felony conviction would require a sentence of 25 years to life. Ewing was charged with and convicted of one count of felony grand theft for the incident at the golf course. During sentencing, Ewing requested the judge in the case exercise discretion ermitted under California law and reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor. The judge declined and sentenced Ewing in accordance with the three strikes law. On aeal, Ewing argued the sentence of 25 years to life was grossly disroortionate to the crime and therefore a violation of the Eighth Amendment rotection against cruel and unusual unishments. The court, reasoning that the three strikes law served the state's legitimate interests, rejected this claim. The California Sureme Court declined to hear the case."
"Although investigators concluded that Curtis Cambell caused an accident in which one erson was killed and another ermanently disabled, his insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Comany, contested liability and took the case to trial. State Farm assured the Cambells that they would reresent their interests. After losing in court, the Cambells sued State Farm for bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In the first art of the trial, the jury found State Farm's decision not to settle unreasonable. In the second art, the trial court denied State Farm's renewed motion to exclude dissimilar out-of-state conduct evidence, ruling such evidence was admissible to determine whether State Farm's conduct in the Cambell case was indeed intentional and sufficiently egregious to warrant unitive damages. The jury awarded the Cambells $2.6 million in comensatory damages and $145 million in unitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $1 million and $25 million resectively. The Utah Sureme Court reinstated the $145 million unitive damages award."
"Several Louisiana cotton gins sued Entergy, an electric utility comany, because it had over-billed them for electricity between 1988 and 1994. The gins claimed that Entergy had failed to notify them of a lower rate that would have saved them more than $2 million over the six-year eriod. Louisiana law requires that utility comanies notify customers when they are eligible for a lower rate. Furthermore, the gins claimed that Entergy had discriminated against them by notifying several other gins in the state of the lower rate. Deferring to the decision of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, the state's utility regulatory agency, a state district court ruled against Entergy. The Sureme Court of Louisiana affirmed the decision on aeal."
"In January 1999, a 14-year-old girl disaeared. The olice discovered that she had been having a sexual relationshi with her 19-year-old half-brother, who had been with Robert Kau on the day of the girl’s disaearance. The olice questioned the girl’s half-brother and Kau at olice headquarters and allowed Kau to leave. The half-brother later confessed to stabbing the missing girl and imlicated Kau in the crime. The olice failed to obtain a warrant to question Kau, but they went to his home in the middle of the night and were given ermission to enter by Kau’s father. Police officers awakened Kau and said, “We need to go and talk,” and Kau resonded, “Okay.” Wearing only his ajamas and no shoes, Kau was handcuffed and taken for questioning. There is no evidence that Kau was told he could decline to go with the officers for questioning. Kau was read his Miranda rights at the olice station and, after being informed of the half-brother’s confession, admitted to some involvement in the crime. At trial, Kau moved to suress his confession as the fruit of an illegal arrest. The motion was denied, and Kau was convicted of murder and sentenced to 55 years in rison. The Texas Court of Aeals confirmed the district court’s conviction and held that no arrest had occurred until after Kau’s confession because Kau’s statement indicated that he consented to going with the officers. The Texas Court of Criminal Aeals denied discretionary review."
"Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 USC section 1226(c), the Attorney General shall take into custody any alien who is removable from this country because he has been convicted of one of a secified set of crimes, including an aggravated felony. After Hyung Joon Kim, a lawful ermanent resident alien, was convicted in state court of first-degree burglary and etty theft with riors, the Immigration and Naturalization Service charged him with being deortable and detained him ending his removal hearing. Kim filed a habeas corus action challenging section 1226(c) on the ground that his detention violated due rocess because the INS had made no determination that he osed either a danger to society or a flight risk. The District Court granted Kim's etition. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that the INS had not rovided a justification for no-bail civil detention sufficient to overcome a ermanent resident alien's liberty interest."
"Beginning in 1996, a number of allegations arose that Nike was mistreating and underaying workers at foreign facilities. Nike resonded to the charges in numerous ways, such as by issuing ress releases. In 1998, Marc Kasky, a California resident, sued Nike for unfair and decetive ractices under California's Unfair Cometition Law. Kasky alleged that Nike made """"false statements andor material omissions of fact"""" concerning the working conditions under which its roducts are manufactured. Nike filed a demurrer, contending that Kasky's suit was absolutely barred by the First Amendment. The trial court dismissed the case and the California Court of Aeal affirmed. In reversing, the California Sureme Court found that Nike's messages were commercial seech, but that the suit was at such a reliminary stage that the issue whether any false reresentations had been made had yet to be resolved."
"The Hazard Elimination Program rovides state governments with funding to imrove the most dangerous sections of their roads. To be eligible for funding, a state must undertake a thorough evaluation of its ublic roads. This led to concerns that the absence of confidentiality would increase the liability risk for accidents that took lace at hazardous locations before imrovements could be made. Ultimately, Congress rovided that materials """"comiled or collected"""" for uroses of the rogram """"shall not be subject to discovery or admitted into evidence in a Federal or State court roceeding."""" In 1996, Ignacio Guillen's wife died in an automobile accident in a Pierce County, Washington intersection. While Washington had reviously been denied funding for the intersection where the accident occurred, its second request was granted after the accident. Guillen first sought information on the intersection and then asserted that the state had been negligent in failing to install roer traffic controls. Washington sought to rotect itself under the Program. The Washington Sureme Court held that the Program exceeded Congress's ower under the Constitution."
"Phili Breuer sued in state court to resolve an overtime disute under the Federal Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Attorneys for Breuer's emloyer, Jim's Concrete of Brevard, had the case moved to federal court by citing the federal removal statute. According to the statute, defendants in state court cases dealing with federal laws may have the case moved to federal court """"unless otherwise exressly rovided by Act of Congress."""" Breuer's attorney argued that Congress had rovided for suits under the FLSA to be heard in state court and that the case should therefore be returned to state court; attorneys for Jim's Concrete disagreed. The district court refused to send the case back to state court. The 11th Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Erick Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in federal District Court. The Court of Aeals affirmed his convictions on November 23, 1998, the court's mandate issued on December 15, 1998, and Clay did not file a etition for a writ of certiorari. One year and 69 days after the Court of Aeals issued its mandate, and exactly one year after the time for seeking certiorari exired, Clay filed a motion for ostconviction relief under 28 USC section 2255. Section 2255 rovides that such motions are subject to a one-year time limitation that runs from """"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final."""" The District Court stated that when a federal risoner does not seek certiorari, his judgment of conviction becomes final for section 2255 uroses uon issuance of the court of aeals's mandate. Because Clay filed his motion more than one year after that date, the court denied it as time barred. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Before 1994, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) allowed States to charge interstate motor carriers annual registration fees of u to $10 er vehicle. Under this system, some States discounted or waived registration fees for carriers from other States in exchange for recirocal treatment. Under the Intermodal Surface Transortation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), the ICC imlemented a new registration system. ISTEA also caed state registration fees by establishing a fee system that """"will result in a fee for each articiating State that is equal to the fee?that such State collected or charged as of?1991."""" In 1991, the Michigan Public Service Commission did not levy a fee for Yellow Transortation, Inc.'s trucks ursuant to a recirocal agreement. However, in 1992, the commission changed how it comuted fees and, ultimately, levied a fee of $10 er vehicle on Yellow Transortation's entire fleet. Yellow Transortation sued, alleging that, because Michigan had not collected or charged a 1991 registration fee for those trucks, ISTEA's fee-ca rovision rohibits Michigan from levying a fee for them. The Michigan Sureme Court concluded that recirocity agreements are not relevant in determining what fee a State charged or collected as of 1991. The court reasoned that the new fee system is not based on the fees collected from one comany, but at the generic fee Michigan charged or collected from carriers as of 1991."
"The University of Michigan’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) considers a number of factors in its evaluative rocess, such as high school grades, standardized test scores, curriculum strength, alumni relationshis, geograhy, and leadershi. The OUA also considers race and admits virtually every qualified alicant from certain grous determined to be “underreresented minorities.” Beginning in 1998, the OUA used a oint system in which students were awarded an additional 20 oints for being a member of an underreresented minority, and beginning in 1999, the University established an Admissions Review Committee to rovide an additional level of consideration.In 1995, Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher both alied for admission to the University of Michigan’ College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as residents of the state of Michigan. Both are of Caucasian descent. Both were denied admission and told that, although they were qualified, they were not cometitive enough alicants to be admitted on first review. In October 1997, Gratz and Hamacher filed a class action suit against the University, the LSA, Lee Bollinger, and James Duderstadt. They argued that the admission rocedure discriminated against certain racial and ethnic grous in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district court held that the resondents had shown that a racially and ethnically diverse student body roduced significant academic benefits but that the admission olicies of 1995-1998 were roblematic because they amounted to “holding seats” for certain minority grous. Therefore, the court granted summary judgment for the etitioners with resect to the admissions olicies for 1995-1998 and for the resondents with resect to the olicy that began in 1999. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit heard this case the same day as emGrutter v. Bollingerem, a similar case, and uheld the University’s admission olicies in that case. The etitioners in this case then asked the Court to grant certiorari, desite the lack of oinion from the lower court, to resolve the issue."
"Barry Black, Richard Elliott, and Jonathan O'Mara were convicted searately of violating a Virginia statute that makes it a felony """"for any erson..., with the intent of intimidating any erson or grou..., to burn...a cross on the roerty of another, a highway or other ublic lace,"""" and secifies that """"any such burning...shall be rima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate a erson or grou."""" At trial, Black objected on First Amendment grounds to a jury instruction that cross burning by itself is sufficient evidence from which the required """"intent to intimidate"""" could be inferred. He was found guilty. O'Mara leaded guilty to charges of violating the statute, but reserved the right to challenge its constitutionality. In Elliott's trial, the judge did not give an instruction on the statute's rima facie evidence rovision. Ultimately, the Virginia Sureme Court held, among other things, that the cross-burning statute is unconstitutional on its face and that the rima facie evidence rovision renders the statute overbroad because the robability of rosecution under the statute chills the exression of rotected seech."
"In 1991, Leonard and Arlene Warner sold the Warner Manufacturing Comany to Elliott and Carol Archer. Subsequently, the Archers sued the Warners for fraud connected with the sale. In settling the lawsuit, the Archers executed releases excet for obligations under a $100,000 romissory note and then voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit. After the Warners failed to make the first ayment on the romissory note, the Archers sued in state court. The Warners filed for bankrutcy, and the Bankrutcy Court ordered liquidation under Chater 7. The Archers then brought a claim asking the Bankrutcy Court to find the $100,000 debt nondischargeable and to order the Warners to ay the sum. The Bankrutcy Code rovides that a debt shall not be dischargeable in bankrutcy """"to the extent"""" it is """"for money...obtained by...false retenses, a false reresentation, or actual fraud."""" The Bankrutcy Court denied the Archers' claim. The District Court and the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"After the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auctioned off certain broadband ersonal communications services licenses to NextWave Personal Communications, Inc., Nextwave filed for Chater 11 bankrutcy rotection and susended ayments to all creditors, including the FCC. The FCC asserted that NextWave's licenses had been canceled automatically when the comany missed its first ayment-deadline and announced that NextWave's licenses were available for auction. Ultimately, when the FCC denied NextWave's etition for reconsideration of the license cancellation, the Court of Aeals for the D. C. Circuit held that the cancellation violated 11 USC section 525(a), which rovides that a """"governmental unit may not...revoke...a license...to...a debtor...solely because such...debtor...has not aid a debt that is dischargeable in the case."""" (Together with No. 01-657, Arctic Sloe Regional Cor. et al. v. NextWave Personal Communications Inc. et al.)"
"After attending a gun show in Texas, Thomas Bean drove to Mexico. When Mexican officials stoed his vehicle at the border, they found ammunition, and Bean was subsequently convicted in a Mexican court of imorting ammunition. Because of his felony conviction, 18 USC section 922(g)(1) rohibited Bean from ossessing, distributing, or receiving firearms or ammunition. Bean alied to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) for relief from his firearms disabilities, but the ATF returned the alication unrocessed, exlaining that its annual aroriations law forbade it from exending any funds to investigate or act uon alications such as Bean's. Bean then filed suit, asking the District Court to conduct its own inquiry into his fitness to ossess a gun and grant relief from his inability to ossess, distribute, or receive firearms or ammunition. The court granted the requested relief, and the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Several H&am;R Block customers, who took out loans from Beneficial National Bank in anticiation of their tax refunds, sued the bank in state court. The customers alleged that the bank charged excessive interest in violation of Alabama law. The bank asked that the case be heard in federal, rather than state, court, because the issues were covered under the National Bank Act (NBA), a federal law. The district court ruled in favor of the bank; the 11th Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, holding that the NBA did not comletely reemt state laws governing lending rates and that the case could therefore be heard in state court."
"The Richmond Redeveloment and Housing Authority (RRHA), a olitical subdivision of Virginia, owns and oerates Whitcomb Court, a low-income housing develoment. In 1997, the Richmond City Council conveyed Whitcomb Court's streets to the RRHA. Subsequently, the RRHA enacted a olicy authorizing the Richmond olice to serve notice on any erson lacking """"a legitimate business or social urose"""" for being on the remises and to arrest for tresassing any erson who remains or returns after having been notified. After the RRHA gave Kevin Hicks, a nonresident, written notice barring him from Whitcomb Court, he tresassed there and was arrested and convicted. At trial, Hicks claimed that RRHA's olicy was unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. The Virginia en banc Court of Aeals vacated his conviction. In affirming, the Virginia Sureme Court found the olicy unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment."
"In 1997, the Federal Government charged Charles Sell with submitting fictitious insurance claims for ayment. Although Sell has a long history of mental illness and was initially found cometent to stand trial for fraud and attemted murder, a Federal Magistrate Judge ordered his hositalization to determine whether he would attain the caacity to allow his trial to roceed. Subsequently, the Magistrate authorized forced administration of antisychotic drugs. In affirming, the District Court concluded that medication was the only viable hoe of rendering Sell cometent to stand trial and was necessary to serve the Federal Government's interest in obtaining an adjudication of his guilt or innocence. The Court of Aeals affirmed. On the fraud charges, the aellate court found that the Federal Government had an essential interest in bringing Sell to trial, that the treatment was medically aroriate, and that the medical evidence indicated that Sell would fairly be able to articiate in his trial."
"The Fair Housing Act (FHA) forbids racial discrimination in resect to the sale or rental of a dwelling. The Holleys, an interracial coule, alleged that a Triad real-estate cororation sales reresentative revented them from buying a Triad-listed house for racially discriminatory reasons. The Holleys filed suit against the sales reresentative and David Meyer, Triad's resident, sole shareholder, and licensed """"officerbroker,"""" claiming that he was vicariously liable for the sales reresentative's unlawful actions. The District Court dismissed the claims, stating that the FHA did not imose ersonal vicarious liability uon a cororate officer or a """"designated officerbroker."""" In reversing, the Court of Aeals ruled that the FHA imoses strict liability rinciles beyond those traditionally associated with agentrincial or emloyeeemloyer relationshis."
"Deborah Wells worked for Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates, P.C. from 1986 until 1997. Wells filed suit, alleging that Clackamas Gastroenterology violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) when it terminated her emloyment. Clackamas moved for summary judgment, arguing that it was not covered by the Act because it did not have 15 or more emloyees for the 20 weeks required by the ADA. This argument deended on the four hysician-shareholders, who own the rofessional cororation and constitute its board of directors, not being counted as emloyees. In granting the motion, the District Court concluded that the hysicians were more analogous to artners in a artnershi than to shareholders in a cororation and therefore were not emloyees under the ADA. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found no reasoned to ermit the rofessional cororation to argue it was a artnershi so as to avoid emloyment discrimination liability."
"Kentucky's two """"Any Willing Provider"""" (AWP) statutes rohibit """"[a] health insurer [from] discriminating against any rovider who is...willing to meet the terms and conditions for articiation established by the?insurer,"""" and require a """"health benefit lan that includes chiroractic benefits [to]...ermit any licensed chiroractor who agrees to abide by the terms [and] conditions?of the?lan to serve as a articiating rimary chiroractic rovider."""" Certain health maintenance organizations (HMOs) filed suit asserting that Kentucky's AWP laws are reemted by the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which reemts all state laws """"insofar as they?relate to any emloyee benefit lan,"""" but saves from reemtion state """"laws...which regulate insurance."""" The District Court concluded that although both AWP statutes """"relate to"""" emloyee benefit lans each law """"regulates insurance"""" and is therefore saved from reemtion. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Oliverio Martinez was stoed while riding his bicycle home from work by olice investigating narcotics violations. When olice attemted to handcuff him, a struggle ensued, but it is unclear who started it. During the struggle, Martinez was shot, resulting in ermanent aralysis and loss of vision. A year later he sued the officers, saying the search and use of deadly force were unconstitutional. The officers introduced as evidence in their defense a taed confession obtained while Martinez was receiving medical treatment in the hosital, in which he admitted to grabbing the gun of one of the officers during the struggle. Martinez claimed that the tae could not be used as evidence because he had not been read his Miranda rights. The district court ruled with Martinez that the tae was inadmissible. The 9th Circuit Court of Aeals unanimously affirmed."
"William Packer was convicted in a California state court for second-degree murder and attemted murder. During jury deliberations, a juror requested dismissal on two searate occasions. In order to avoid having to restart deliberations with a relacement juror, the judge asked the juror to continue. After further conversations between the judge and the juror in question as well as the foreerson of the jury, the jury returned a guilty verdict. On aeal to the Court of Aeals of California, Packer argued that the state trial judge had coerced the jury’s verdict in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due rocess. The aellate court affirmed his conviction and held that, as long as the judge only encouraged further deliberations and did not coerce a certain verdict, there was no violation of due rocess.Packer etitioned for habeas relief from the federal district court, which denied his etition. The US. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s ruling and held that the state aellate court failed to roerly aly federal law and that the judge was imermissibly coercive, which affected the jury’s guilty verdict."
"The Contract Disutes Act of 1978 (CDA) established rules governing disutes arising out of certain federal government contracts. After Congress enacted the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998, which established a comrehensive concession management rogram for national arks, the National Park Service (NPS) issued 36 CFR section 51.3, which urorted to render the CDA inalicable to concession contracts. The National Park Hositality Association challenged 51.3's validity. Uholding the regulation, the District Court concluded that the CDA is ambiguous as to whether it alies to concession contracts and found the NPS's interretation reasonable. In affirming, the Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found the NPS's reading of the CDA consistent with both the CDA and the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998."
"When Dallas County rosecutors used eremtory strikes to exclude 10 of the 11 African-Americans eligible to serve on the jury at Thomas Miller-El's caital murder trial, he moved to strike the jury on the ground that the exclusions violated equal rotection. The trial judge denied relief, finding no evidence indicating a systematic exclusion of African-Americans. Subsequently, the jury found Miller-El guilty, and he was sentenced to death. After Miller-El's direct aeal and state habeas corus etitions were denied, he filed a federal habeas corus etition. The Federal District Court denied Miller-El's alication for a certificate of aealability (COA) in deference to the state courts' accetance of the rosecutors' race-neutral justifications for striking the otential jurors. The Court of Aeals also denied the COA, finding that Miller-El failed to resent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary."
"In 1997, Barbara Grutter, a white resident of Michigan, alied for admission to the University of Michigan Law School. Grutter alied with a 3.8 undergraduate GPA and an LSAT score of 161. She was denied admission. The Law School admits that it uses race as a factor in making admissions decisions because it serves a """"comelling interest in achieving diversity among its student body."""" The District Court concluded that the Law School's stated interest in achieving diversity in the student body was not a comelling one and enjoined its use of race in the admissions rocess. In reversing, the Court of Aeals held that Justice Powell's oinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), constituted a binding recedent establishing diversity as a comelling governmental interest sufficient under strict scrutiny review to justify the use of racial references in admissions. The aellate court also rejected the district court's finding that the Law School's """"critical mass"""" was the functional equivalent of a quota."
"In 1987, Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman was convicted of first-degree murder and related charges. In state ost-conviction roceedings, Abdur'Rahman resented claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and rosecutorial misconduct. Presenting all of his claims to the Tennessee Sureme Court, Abdur'Rahman was denied leave to aeal, and then he only resented some of his claims, on which he ultimately lost, to the federal District Court. While Abdur'Rahman's certiorari etition was ending, the Tennessee Sureme Court adoted Rule 39, which exressly states that Tennessee litigants do not need to seek discretionary review from the court in order to exhaust their claims. Abdur'Rahman then filed a federal motion for relief of judgment, ursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, re-resenting claims that the district court had reviously determined to be unexhausted and rocedurally barred. The District Court construed the Rule 60(b) motion as a second, or successive, habeas corus etition and denied relief. Subsequently, the Court of Aeals denied all of Abdur'Rahman's motions."
"Congress assed the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) in 2000, requiring ublic libraries to install internet filtering software on their comuters in order to qualify for federal funding. The American Library Association and others challenged the law, claiming that it imroerly required them to restrict the First Amendment rights of their atrons. As stiulated by the law, a three judge anel heard the case, and ruled unanimously that the CIPA violated the First Amendment."
"In 1984 Dow Chemical Co. negotiated a settlement in a class action lawsuit filed by Vietnam War veterans who had been exosed to Agent Orange and subsequently develoed various injuries and illnesses. The settlement created a fund that would ay those who develoed illnesses u until 1994. Daniel Stehenson, a Vietnam veteran, develoed cancer in 1998 and could therefore not collect money from the fund. He sued, saying that he was not adequately reresented in the original settlement, which made no rovision for injuries that develoed after 1994. Therefore, he claimed, he had the right to file a suit of his own. The district court ruled for Dow Chemical; the 2nd Circuit Court of Aeals unanimously reversed, ruling for Stehenson."
"Khanh Phuong Nguyen and Tuyet Mai Thi Phan were tried, convicted, and sentenced on federal narcotics charges in the District Court of Guam, a territorial court with subject-matter jurisdiction over both federal-law and local-law causes. The Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit anel that convened to hear their aeals included two judges from that court, both of whom are life-tenured Article III judges, and the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, an Article IV territorial-court judge aointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a 10-year term. Neither Nguyen nor Phan objected to the anel's comosition before the cases were submitted for decision and neither sought rehearing to challenge the anel's authority to decide their aeals immediately after it affirmed their convictions."
"In 1993, Angelo Tsakooulos urchased the Borden Ranch, an 8348-acre ranch in California. Tsakooulos lanned to subdivide the land into arcels for cultivation as vineyards and orchards. Because a dense layer of material revented water from reaching the deths necessary to cultivate vineyards or orchards, Tsakooulos intended to """"dee ri"""" the soil. Dee riing has a dramatic effect on the character of a wetland area. The Cors of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency informed Tsakooulos that he was not to dee ri rotected waters without a ermit. Ultimately, the District Court found that Tsakooulos had violated the Clean Water Act multile times and imosed a substantial fine. The Court of Aeals affirmed in relevant art."
"Every state uses interest on lawyers' trust accounts (IOLTA) to ay for legal services for the needy. Among it rules, Washington's rogram requires that funds that cannot earn net interest for the client be deosited in an IOLTA account. The Sureme Court of Washington extended its IOLTA rules to cover Limited Practice Officers (LPOs), nonlawyers who are licensed to act as escrowees in real estate closings. Allen Brown and Greg Hayes alleged that they regularly urchase and sell real estate, in the course of such transactions they deliver funds to LPOs who are required to deosit them in IOLTA accounts, and the taking of the interest earned on their funds in IOLTA accounts violates the Just Comensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court found, among other things, that Brown and Hayes had lost nothing. Sitting en banc, the Court of Aeals reasoned that there was no taking because Brown and Hayes had suffered neither an actual loss nor an interference with any investment-backed exectations."
"V Secret Catalogue, Inc., the affiliated cororations that own the Victoria's Secret trademarks, filed suit, alleging that the name Victor's Little Secret contributed to """"the dilution of famous marks"""" under the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA). The law defines """"dilution"""" as """"the lessening of the caacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services."""" The District Court granted V Secret summary judgment on the FTDA claim. The Court of Aeals affirmed, finding that V Secret's mark was distinctive and that the evidence established dilution even though no actual harm had been roved."
"Doubleday ublished the WWII book, Crusade in Euroe, registered the work's coyright, and granted exclusive television rights to Twentieth Century Fox Film Cororation. In 1975, Doubleday renewed the book's coyright, but Fox never renewed the coyright on the television series, leaving the series in the ublic domain. In 1988, Fox reacquired the television rights. In 1995, Dastar Cororation released a video set, World War II Camaigns in Euroe, which it made from taes of the original version of the Crusade television series. Fox filed suit, alleged that Dastar's sale of Camaigns without roer credit to the Crusade television series constituted """"reverse assing off"""" in violation of the Lanham Act. The District Court granted Fox summary judgment. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that, because Dastar coied substantially the Crusade series, labeled it with a different name, and marketed it without attribution to Fox, Dastar had committed a """"bodily aroriation"""" of Fox's series, which was sufficient to establish reverse assing off."
"California regulates the minimum rice aid to dairy farmers roducing raw milk by establishing rice minimums and requiring contributions to a rice equalization ool. After it became rofitable for some California rocessors to buy raw milk from out-of-state roducers, the California Deartment of Food and Agriculture amended its regulations to require contributions to the rice equalization ool on some out-of-state urchases. Four dairy farms in Nevada filed suit, alleging that the amendment unconstitutionally discriminated against them. Without reaching the merits, the District Court dismissed both cases. In affirming, the Court of Aeals held that the Federal Agriculture Imrovement and Reform Act of 1996 immunized California's milk ricing and ooling laws from Commerce Clause challenge. The aellate court also held that the individual etitioners' Privileges and Immunities Clause claims failed because the amendment did not create classifications based on any individual's residency or citizenshi."
"Under the False Claims Act (FCA), """"any erson"""" who """"knowingly resents, or causes to be resented, to an officer or emloyee of the United States Government...a false or fraudulent claim for ayment or aroval"""" is liable to the federal government. A rivate erson may bring a qui tam action """"in the name of the Government"""" under the FCA. After the National Institute of Drug Abuse gave Cook County Hosital a $5 million research grant, Janet Chandler, who ran the study for a nonrofit research institute affiliated with the hosital, filed a qui tam action, claiming that Cook County and the institute had submitted false statements to obtain grant funds. Based on recedent, which held that States are not """"ersons"""" subject to FCA qui tam actions, the District Court granted the County's motion to dismiss. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"The Federal Magistrate Act of 1979 authorizes magistrate judges to conduct """"any or all roceedings in a jury or nonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the case"""" with """"the consent of the arties."""" When Jon Withrow, a state risoner, brought suit against members of the rison's medical staff, he gave written consent for the magistrate judge to reside over the entire case. Only one of the three staff members gave written consent. The other two members voluntarily articiated. When the medical staff won, Withrow aealed and the Court of Aeals sua sonte remanded the case to determine whether the arties had consented to roceed before the magistrate judge. Ultimately, the magistrate judge reorted that she had lacked jurisdiction because such consent had to be exressly given. The District Court adoted the reort and recommendation. In affirming, the Court of Aeals found that consent must be exress and that the staffs' ostjudgment consent was inadequate."
"Under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992, the Commissioner of Social Security """"shall, before October 1, 1993,"""" assign each coal industry retiree eligible for benefits under the Act to a comany, which shall then be resonsible for funding the beneficiary's benefits. After October 1, 1993, the Commissioner assigned 600 hundred beneficiaries to various coal comanies. The comanies challenged the assignments, claiming that the statutory date sets a time limit on the Commissioner's ower to assign such that a beneficiary not assigned on October 1, 1993 must be left unassigned for life. Under the comanies' argument, the challenged assignments are void and the corresonding benefits must be financed by other ension lans and funds. The comanies obtained summary judgments, and the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1971, Congress enacted tax rovisions roviding secial tax treatment for exort sales made by an American manufacturer through a subsidiary that qualified as a """"domestic international sales cororation"""" (DISC). Regarding research and develoment (R&am;D) exenses, Treasury Regulation 26 CFR section 1.861-8(e)(3) rovides what must be treated as a cost when calculating combined taxable income (CTI), and how those costs should be allocated among different roducts and aortioned between the DISC and its arent. Under this regulation, the Internal Revenue Service reallocated Boeing's comany sonsored R&am;D costs for 1979 to 1987, thereby decreasing the untaxed rofits of its exort subsidiaries and increasing its taxable rofits on exort sales. Subsequently, Boeing filed suit, arguing that it had an unqualified right to allocate its comany sonsored R&am;D exenses to secific roducts and to exclude any allocated R&am;D from being treated as a cost of another roduct. In granting Boeing summary judgment, the District Court found section 1.861-8(e)(3) invalid due to a secific DISC regulation giving the taxayer the right to grou and allocate income and costs by roduct or roduct line. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"In 1989, Clyde Timothy Bunkley was convicted of burglary in the first degree because he was armed with a “dangerous weaon” at the time of the burglary. The “dangerous weaon” was a ocketknife with a 2.5-3 inch blade. In 1997, the state court interreted the “common ocketknife” excetion to the definition of “weaon” as a blade of 3.75 inches or shorter. Bunkley filed a motion for state ost-conviction relief based on the state court’s 1997 decision and argued that his ocketknife could not have been considered a “weaon.” The trial court rejected the defendant’s motion for relief, and the Court of Aeals affirmed. The Florida Sureme Court also affirmed and found the “common ocketknife” excetion did not aly retroactively because the 1997 decision was merely an “evolutionary refinement,” not a “major constitutional change,” and therefore did not aly retroactively."
"Fredy Orlando Ventura illegally entered the United States in 1993. In 1998, an immigration judge heard Orlando Ventura’s request for asylum in the United States; he claimed that his olitical views made him a target for guerilla armies in Guatemala. The judge denied Orlando Ventura’s request, desite recognizing that Orlando Ventura’s fears of rosecution may be legitimate, because the olitical climate in Guatemala had drastically changed since Orlando Ventura had arrived in the United States and therefore he was no longer in danger. The Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) affirmed the judgment of the immigration judge, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit was “comelled” by Orlando Ventura’s testimony to reverse the lower court’s decision and subsequently denied remand to the BIA."
"In 1971 Congress assed the Federal Election Camaign Act, banning direct cororate donations to federal election camaigns. In 2000, Christine Beaumont and the North Carolina Right to Life (NCRL), an anti-abortion advocacy grou, challenged the act, saying it violated their right to free seech. The grou is an incororated non-rofit that lobbies and backs olitical candidates friendly to its cause, but under the act it cannot make olitical donations. The district court ruled in favor of NCRL. The 4th Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1993, California enacted a new criminal statute of limitations ermitting rosecution for sex-related child abuse where the rior limitations eriod has exired if the rosecution is begun within one year of a victim's reort to olice. In 1998, Marion Stogner was indicted for sex-related child abuse committed between 1955 and 1973. Without the new statute allowing revival of the State's cause of action, California could not have rosecuted Stogner. Stogner moved to dismiss the comlaint on the ground that the Ex Post Facto Clause forbids revival of a reviously time-barred rosecution. The trial court agreed, but the California Court of Aeal reversed. The trial court denied Stogner's subsequent dismissal motion, in which he argued that his rosecution violated the Ex Post Facto and Due Process Clauses. The Court of Aeal affirmed."
"A grou of racetracks that earn revenue from gambling sued the state of Iowa, claiming that the state's ractice of taxing racetrack gambling at a higher rate than riverboat gambling violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The grou asserted that gambling at racetracks and riverboat casinos is is not substantially different, and that the state should therefore charge the same tax rate for both activities. A state district court sided with the state, ruling that imortant differences did exist between riverboat and racetrack gambling; the Iowa Sureme Court reversed in a 4-3 decision."
"During Duyonn Vincent's trial, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict of acquittal as to first-degree murder. Subsequently, when the rosecution made a statement on first-degree murder, defense counsel objected, arguing that the court had granted its directed verdict motion and that further rosecution on first-degree murder would violate the Double Jeoardy Clause. The judge resonded that he had granted the motion but had not directed a verdict. The judge then submitted the first-degree murder charge to the jury, which convicted Vincent on that charge. The Michigan Court of Aeals reversed the conviction based on the Double Jeoardy Clause. In reversing, the State Sureme Court determined that the trial judge's comments were not sufficiently final to terminate jeoardy. Subsequently, the Federal District Court granted Vincent's federal habeas corus etition after concluding that continued rosecution for first-degree murder had violated the Double Jeoardy Clause and the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The National Organization for Women, Inc. (NOW) filed a class action alleging that certain individuals and organizations that oose legal abortion violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act (RICO) by engaging in a nationwide consiracy to shut down abortion clinics through """"a attern of racketeering activity"""" that included acts of extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act. Ultimately, the District Court entered a ermanent nationwide injunction against the abortion oonents. Uholding the injunction, the Court of Aeals held, in art, that the things abortion suorters claimed were extorted from them, such as women's right to seek medical services from the clinics and the clinic doctors' rights to erform their jobs, constituted """"roerty"""" that was """"obtained"""" for uroses of the Hobbs Act. (Together with No. 01-1119, Oeration Rescue v. National Organization for Women.)"
"Under Public Law 86-392, the former Fort Aache Military Reservation is held in trust for the White Mountain Aache Tribe. The Tribe sued the federal government to rehabilitate the roerty, alleging that the United States had breached a fiduciary duty to maintain, rotect, reair, and reserve it. In its motion to dismiss, the federal government argued that jurisdiction was lacking here because no statute or regulation could be read to imose a legal obligation on it to maintain or restore the trust roerty, let alone authorize comensation for breach. The Court of Federal Claims agreed and dismissed the comlaint. In reversing, the Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit concluded that the federal government's roerty use triggered a common-law trustee's duty to act reasonably to reserve any roerty the Secretary of the Interior chose to utilize, which also suorted a money damages claim."
"If a federal court with jurisdiction over a civil action declines to exercise sulement jurisdiction over other related claims, the claims will be dismissed and must be refiled in state court. To revent the limitations eriod on those claims from exiring, 28 USC section 1367(d) requires state courts to toll the eriod while a sulemental claim is ending in federal court. In 1994, Susan Jinks filed a federal-court action against Richland County, South Carolina. The District Court granted the county summary judgment and declined to exercise jurisdiction over Jinks's state-law claims. Jinks then filed the sulemental claims in state court and won. In reversing, the Sureme Court of South Carolina found the state-law claims time-barred. Although they would not have been barred under section 1367(d)'s tolling rule, the court held section 1367(d) unconstitutional as alied to claims brought in state court against a State's olitical subdivisions."
"On August 13, 1998, Edwin David’s car was towed because he was imroerly arked in a sot where arking was rohibited. He claimed he could not see the “no arking” sign because there were trees blocking it from view. David aid the fees to recover his car, but he also submitted a request for a hearing to challenge the ticket and recover his money. The hearing was held 27 days after the car was towed, and David’s claim was dismissed. David then sued the City of Los Angeles under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and claimed that the 27-day wait for the hearing denied him due rocess under the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court granted summary judgment for the City, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that the Due Process Clause required that the city hold a hearing at least within five days."
"Under the Coyright and Patent Clause of the Constitution, Article 1, section 8, """"Congress shall have Power...to romote the Progress of Science...by securing [to Authors] for limited Times...the exclusive Right to their...Writings."""" In the 1998 Coyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), Congress enlarged the duration of coyrights by 20 years, making coyrights now run from creation until 70 years after the author's death. Petitioners, whose roducts or services build on coyrighted works that have entered the ublic domain, argued that the CTEA violates both the Coyright Clause's """"limited Times"""" rescrition and the First Amendment's free seech guarantee. They claimed Congress cannot extend the coyright term for ublished works with existing coyrights. The District Court and the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed."
"When Romo's Ford Bronco swerved to avoid another vehicle, it rolled over, killing three of the Romo family and injuring three more. A California jury found that the rollover was caused by a dangerous flaw in the design of the Bronco, which Ford had willfully ignored. The jury awarded Romo $5 million in comensatory damages (which are intended to comensate the laintiff for a loss) and $290 million in unitive damages (which are intended to unish the defendant for wrongdoing.) Ford argued that the very large award of unitive damages was excessive. Nevertheless, the California Fifth Aellate District Court of Aeal uheld the verdict, comaring the level of Ford's negligence to involuntary manslaughter. After the California Sureme Court declined to hear the case, Ford aealed to the U.S. Sureme Court, arguing that the unitive damages awarded by the jury were so excessive as to be rohibited by the Constitution's Due Process Clause."
"The California Medical Board denied Hason a license to ractice medicine because of his mental illness. Hason sued in federal district court, alleging that his rights were violated under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The district court dismissed the suit, holding that his claims were barred by the 11th Amendment's guarantee of sovereign immunity, which rohibits a rivate arty from suing a non-consenting state or its agencies in federal court. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, ruling that Congress abrogated 11th Amendment sovereign immunity by enacting Title II of the ADA """"and thus states and their agencies may be sued ursuant to Title II."""""
"In 1999 the California legislature enacted the Holocaust Victim Insurance Relief Act (HVIRA) in an attemt to facilitate Holocaust-era insurance claims by California residents. The Act required all insurance comanies doing business in California that sold olicies to eole in Euroe between 1920 and 1945 to make ublic all of those olicies, including the names of olicy owners and the status of the olicies. A grou of insurance comanies and a trade organization sued, saying that only the federal government, with its jurisdiction over commerce and foreign affairs, had the right to enact such legislation. They also said the law violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution because the comanies, if they failed to comly, could lose their insurance licenses. The District Court ruled for the insurance comanies; the 9th Circuit Court of Aeals reversed."
"On November 8, 1982, John Louis Visciotti and his co-worker attemted to rob two fellow emloyees while driving together to a arty. Visciotti asked the driver to sto the car in a remote area, ulled out a gun, and demanded the victims’ wallets. Because the victims had little money in their wallets, Visciotti located the money in the car and then shot the victims. Visciotti was convicted of first-degree murder, attemted murder, and robbery. The jury recommended the death enalty since the homicide took lace during a robbery with a deadly weaon.Visciotti etitioned for a writ of habeas corus from the California Sureme Court and claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The California Sureme Court denied the etition and held that, although Visciotti received ineffective assistance of counsel at the enalty hase of his trial, the jury was not rejudiced. The state court interreted the Sureme Court’s ineffective assistance of counsel recedent as requiring the defendant to show that, more likely than not, the outcome of the trial would have been different had it not been for the ineffective assistance of counsel. Visciotti then etitioned for a writ of habeas corus from the federal district court, which granted the etition and determined that Visciotti had received ineffective assistance of counsel. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"Leandro Andrade was found guilty of two felony counts of etty theft with a rior conviction after he stole aroximately $150 worth of videotaes. Under California's three strikes regime, a judge sentenced him to two consecutive terms of 25 years to life. In affirming, the California Court of Aeal rejected his claim that his sentence violated the Eighth Amendment. After the Sureme Court of California denied discretionary review, Andrade filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus in Federal District Court. The District Court denied his etition. In reversing, the Court of Aeals granted Andrade a certificate of aealability as to his claim that his sentence violated the Eighth Amendment."
"A grou of hysicians filed suit against a number of managed-health-care organizations, alleging they violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act (RICO) by failing to reimburse them for health-care services that they had rovided to atients covered by the organizations' lans. The District Court refused to comel arbitration of the RICO claims on the ground that the arbitration clauses in the arties' agreements rohibited awards of unitive damages. Subsequently, the court found the arbitration agreements unenforceable. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Gilbert Hyatt filed a art-year resident income-tax return in California for 1991, which reresented that he had become a Nevada resident in October 1991, shortly before he received substantial licensing fees. The California Franchise Tax Board (CFTB) determined that Hyatt was a California resident until Aril 1992 and issued notices of roosed assessments and imosed substantial civil fraud enalties. Hyatt filed suit against CFTB in a Nevada state court, alleging that CFTB had committed negligence and intentional torts during the course of its audit. CFTB argued that the state court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because full faith and credit required that the court aly California law immunizing CFTB from suit. Ultimately, the Nevada Sureme Court allowed the intentional tort claims to roceed to trial. The court held that affording CFTB statutory immunity with resect to intentional torts would contravene Nevada's interest in rotecting its citizens from injurious intentional torts and bad faith acts committed by sister States' government emloyees."
"Kevin Wiggins was convicted and sentenced to death for a 1988 murder. He aealed, claiming that his attorney's decision not to tell jurors about Wiggins' troubled childhood amounted to ineffective counsel because it resulted in a harsher sentence. Prosecutors countered that the attorney's decision had been carefully considered, and that a different decision would not necessarily have resulted in a different outcome. Therefore, they said, it was not ineffective counsel. A Maryland district court sided with Wiggins; the Maryland Sureme Court reversed, siding with the state. On aeal to federal court, the 4th Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed, ruling for Maryland."
"The Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 (IMLA) allows Indian tribes, with the aroval of the Secretary of the Interior, to lease the mining rights on their tribal lands to rivate comanies. In 1964, Navajo Nation (tribe) entered into a lease with the redecessor of Peabody Coal Comany, allowing Peabody to mine on the tribe's land in return for a royalty of 37.5 cents for every ton of coal mined. The agreement was subject to renegotiation after 20 years. By 1984, the tribe's royalty was only worth 2% of Peabody's gross roceeds. In 1977 Congress had required a minimum of 12.5%. The tribe requested that the Secretary set a new rate, and the Director of Bureau of Indian Affairs for the Navajo Area, as the Secretary's reresentative, made a reliminary decision to set the rate at 20%. Peabody's reresentatives urged the Secretary to reverse or delay the decision. The Secretary agreed, and urged the arties to resume negotiations. The tribe and Peabody agreed on a rate of 12.5%. In 1993, however, the tribe sued the government in the Court of Federal Claims, alleging a breach of trust and claiming $600 million in damages. The court ruled for the government, exlaining that though the government may have betrayed the tribe's trust by acting in Peabody's interest rather than the tribe's, it had not violated any secific statutory or regulatory obligation. The tribe was therefore not entitled to monetary relief. On aeal, the tribe argued that the entirety of the IMLA imoses on the government a broad obligation to look after the wellbeing of the tribe. The Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit agreed and reversed the lower court, finding that """"the Secretary must act in the best interests of the Indian tribes."""""
"In 1997, olice stoed a truck in Nevada and seized the illegal drugs that it was carrying. With the hel of the truck drivers, the olice set u a sting. Francisco Jimenez Recio and Adrian Loez-Meza came for the truck and were subsequently arrested. A jury convicted Jimenez Recio and Loez-Meza of consiracy, but the trial judge ordered a new trial under Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals recedent that held a consiracy terminates when """"'there is affirmative evidence of...defeat of the object of the consiracy.'"""" In other words, the federal government could not rosecute the drug consiracy defendants unless they had joined the consiracy before the government seized the drugs. The new jury convicted the two men once again. In reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that the evidence resented at the second trial was insufficient to show that Jimenez Recio and Loez-Meza had joined the consiracy before the drug seizure."
"With the recommendation of his doctor, Kenneth Nord filed for disability benefits with his emloyer of 25 years, Kwikset Cor., a comany owned by Black &am; Decker Cor. After the comany denied his claim, Nord asked for a review of the denial. A doctor hired by the comany determined that Nord could in fact erform the duties required by his job and was therefore ineligible for benefits, desite determinations to the contrary by Nord's hysician, his orthoedic surgeon and a Black &am; Decker human resource reresentative. Nord sued to have the decision reversed, claiming that the comany's reference of its doctor's oinion over the oinions of the other hysicians violated the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The district court ruled in favor of Black &am; Decker Cor. The 9th Circuit Court of Aeals reversed."
"Joseh Massaro was indicted on federal racketeering charges, including murder in aid of racketeering. Though rosecutors found a bullet before the trial began and did not inform the defense until the trial was underway, defense counsel declined more than once the trial court's offer of a continuance so the bullet could be examined. Subsequently, Massaro was convicted. On direct aeal, Massaro but did not raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim and the Court of Aeals affirmed. Massaro later moved to vacate his conviction, under 28 USC section 2255, based on an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. The District Court found his claim rocedurally defaulted because he could have raised it on direct aeal. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that, when the defendant is reresented by new counsel on aeal and the ineffective-assistance claim is based solely on the trial record, the claim must be raised on direct aeal."
"Rex Srietsma's wife was killed in a boating accident when she was struck by the roeller of a motor made by Mercury Marine. Srietsma sued Mercury Marine under Illinois common law, alleging that his wife's injuries were caused by an unreasonably dangerous motor. The trial court, the intermediate court, and the Illinois Sureme Court all dismissed the comlaint, finding the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 (FBSA) reemted such state common-law claims."
"VietNow National Headquarters, a charitable nonrofit cororation, retained for-rofit fundraising telemarketing cororations to solicit donations to aid Vietnam veterans. The contracts rovided that the telemarketers would retain 85 ercent of the gross receits from Illinois donors. The Illinois Attorney General filed a comlaint in state court, alleging that the telemarketers reresented to donors that a significant amount of each dollar donated would be aid over to VietNow for charitable endeavors and that such reresentations were knowingly decetive and materially false and constituted a fraud. The trial court granted the telemarketers' motion to dismiss on First Amendment grounds. In affirming, the Illinois Sureme Courts relied on U.S. Sureme Court recedent that held that certain regulations of charitable solicitation barring fees in excess of a rescribed level effectively imosed rior restraints on fundraising and were therefore incomatible with the First Amendment."
"When David Sattazahn's enalty-hase jury reorted to the trial judge that it was hoelessly deadlocked 9-to-3 for life imrisonment, the court discharged the jury and entered a life sentence, as required under Pennsylvania law. On aeal, the Pennsylvania Suerior Court reversed Sattazahn's first-degree murder conviction and remanded for a new trial. At the second trial, Pennsylvania again sought the death enalty and the jury again convicted Sattazahn, but this time the jury imosed a death sentence. In affirming, the Pennsylvania Sureme Court found that neither the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeoardy Clause nor the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause barred Pennsylvania from seeking the death enalty at the retrial."
"Six emloyees of the Norfolk and Western Railroad Comany contracted asbestosis, a disease caused by exosure to asbestos. The emloyees brought suit under the Federal Emloyers' Liability Act (FELA), including a damages request for ain and suffering caused by a fear of cancer (which they had not yet contracted). The district court ruled for the laintiffs. The court of aeals denied discretionary review."
"Following the 2000 Census, the Democratic-controlled Georgia legislature assed a redistricting lan that was backed by many black leaders because it would have sread black voters and influence across several districts rather than concentrating them in a select few. Georgia's Reublican governor objected to the lan because he said it violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which discourages the dilution of minority voting strength. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected the legislature's lan."
"Connecticut's """"Megan's Law"""" requires ersons convicted of sexual offenses to register with the Deartment of Public Safety and requires the Deartment to ost a sex offender registry containing registrants' names, addresses, hotograhs, and descritions on the Internet. John Doe, a convicted sex offender who is subject to the law, filed suit, claiming that the law violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The District Court enjoined the law's ublic disclosure rovisions. In affirming, the Court of Aeals concluded that such disclosure violated the Due Process Clause because officials did not afford registrants a rederivation hearing."
"In Lindh v. Murhy, 521 U.S. 320, the U.S. Sureme Court held that amendments to the criminal code made by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) do not aly to cases ending in federal court on the AEDPA's effective date, Aril 24, 1996. Robert Garceau was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. After his etition for state ostconviction relief was denied, Garceau moved for the aointment of federal habeas counsel and a stay of execution in Federal District Court on May 12, 1995. He filed a federal habeas alication on July 2, 1996. The District Court concluded that Garceau's habeas alication was not subject to AEDPA because his motions for counsel and a stay were filed rior to that date. The Court of Aeals agreed."
"William Hibbs, an emloyee of the Nevada Deartment of Human Resources, sought leave to care for his wife under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). The FMLA entitles an eligible emloyee to take u to 12 workweeks of unaid leave annually for the onset of a """"serious health condition"""" in the emloyee's souse. The Deartment granted Hibbs's request for the full 12 weeks of FMLA leave and, after he had exhausted that leave, informed him that he must reort to work by a certain date. When Hibbs failed to do so, he was fired. Pursuant to FMLA rovisions creating a rivate right of action """"against any emloyer"""" that """"interfered with, restrained, or denied the exercise of"""" FMLA rights, Hibbs sued in Federal District Court, seeking money damages for FMLA violations. The District Court concluded that the Eleventh Amendment barred the FMLA claim. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"Catharina Costa was fired from her job as a heavy equiment oerator at Desert Palace Casino. She filed a sexual discrimination lawsuit, charging that the firing was the culmination of discrimination that had occurred during her emloyment. Jurors during the trial were instructed by the judge to rule for Costa if they determined that sex was a motivating factor in the firing, even if other (legal) factors were resent as well. The jury ruled for Costa. Desert Palace aealed, saying that the instructions incorrectly shifted the burden of roof to the defendant in the case. A three judge anel from the 11th Circuit Court of Aeals agreed, ruling for the casino, but a subsequent review of the case by all 11 judges of the 11th Circuit reversed the anel's decision."
"The State of Washington, through its Deartment of Social and Health Services, rovides foster care to certain children. It also receives and manages Social Security benefits, which it uses to cover its costs, for many of those children. Such beneficiary children filed suit, alleging that the Deartment's use of their benefits to reimburse itself for the foster care costs violated the """"anti-attachment"""" rovision of Title II of the Social Security Act, which rotects certain benefits from """"execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal rocess."""" The trial court enjoined the Deartment from continuing to charge its foster care costs against Social Security benefits and ordered restitution of revious reimbursement transfers. The Washington Sureme Court ultimately affirmed the trial court's holding that the Deartment's ractices violated the anti-attachment rovision."
"In order to achieve savings on Medicaid urchases above federal cost-saving measures, the """"Maine Rx"""" Program reduces rescrition drug rices for state residents. Under the rogram, Maine attemts negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers. If a comany does not enter into a rebate agreement, its Medicaid sales are subjected to a rior authorization rocedure that requires state agency aroval to qualify a doctor's rescrition for reimbursement. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an association of nonresident drug manufacturers, challenged the rogram, claiming that it is re-emted by the Medicaid Act and violates the Commerce Clause. Without resolving any factual issues, the District Court entered a reliminary injunction reventing the statute's imlementation, concluding that any obstacle to the federal rogram's administration is sufficient to establish re-emtion. The Court of Aeals reversed."
"During an investigation of welfare fraud, the Inyo County Sheriff's office requested ersonnel files from a casino owned by the Paiute-Shoshone Indian tribe. When the request was denied, the Sheriff's office obtained a warrant to search for the records at the casino. After the search, the tribe sued, claiming that it was a violation of their sovereign immunity. The district court ruled for Inyo County; a 9th Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed, ruling for the Paiute-Shoshone tribe."
"In an attemt to solve a contract disute, Lynn and Burt Bazzle filed suit against Green Tree Financial Cororation. After they filed the suit, the Bazzles learned that other Green Tree customers were dealing with the same sort of disute. As a result, they asked for and received ermission to file a class action suit. However, Green Tree contracts had a clause requiring that any contract disutes be settled by an arbitrator. Green Tree asked the court to revoke the class certification because the Federal Arbitration Act, it argued, did not ermit class-wide arbitration. Instead, the arbitration would have to be conducted on a case-by-case basis. The South Carolina Sureme Court disagreed, ruling that, unless secifically banned in the contract, class-wide arbitration could be ermitted by the courts."
"Resonding to a reorted weaons disturbance in a rivate residence, Houston olice entered John Lawrence's aartment and saw him and another adult man, Tyron Garner, engaging in a rivate, consensual sexual act. Lawrence and Garner were arrested and convicted of deviate sexual intercourse in violation of a Texas statute forbidding two ersons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct. In affirming, the State Court of Aeals held that the statute was not unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, with a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases198585-140""""emBowers v.

"In 1997, a grou of farm workers from Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Panama, who alleged injury from chemical exosure, filed a state-court action against Dole Food Comany and others. Subsequently, Dole imleaded Dead Sea Bromine Co. and Bromine Comounds, Ltd., or the Dead Sea Comanies. Dole successfully removed the action to federal court, arguing that the federal common law of foreign relations rovided federal-question jurisdiction. The District Court rejected the argument that the Dead Sea Comanies were instrumentalities of a foreign state, Israel, as defined by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) and thus entitled to removal. In reversing, the Court of Aeals concluded that Dole could not base removal on the federal common law of foreign relations and that the Dead Sea Comanies were not instrumentalities of Israel because they did not meet the FSIA's instrumentality definition."
"Citizens Bank (Citizens) and Alafabco Inc. (Alafabco) had multile business dealings with each other sanning over a decade. In 1998, Alafabco bid on a construction job based on a contract it had with Citizens to finance the roject. When Citizens did not finance the roject, Alafabco used existing funds meant to reay the debts it owed to Citizens to fund the roject and subsequently defaulted on its loan ayments to Citizens. Citizens and Alafabco comosed two different debt-restructuring agreements, both of which included arbitration clauses that stated that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) would aly. Alafabco sued Citizens in Alabama state court for breach of contract and claimed that it had incurred detrimental debt because of Citizens’ breach. Citizens invoked the arbitration clause, and the state court ordered the arties to submit to arbitration ursuant to their agreement. The Sureme Court of Alabama reversed and held that, because the debt-restructuring agreements did not substantially involve interstate commerce, the FAA did not aly to the arties’ disutes."
"Hurley Henson filed suit in Louisiana state court against Syngenta Cro Protection, Inc., asserting various tort claims related to the manufacture and sale of a chlordimeform-based insecticide. When Henson successfully intervened in a similar action, Price v. Ciba-Geigy Cor., in federal district court, the Louisiana court stayed his state court claim. Although the ensuing settlement in Price stiulated that his state-court action be dismissed with rejudice, the Louisiana state court allowed Henson to roceed. Syngenta then removed the action to the federal District Court under the All Writs Act. The District Court dismissed the former state-court action as barred by the Price settlement. Vacating the dismissal, the Court of Aeals wrote that the All Writs Act could not roerly suort removal of the state-court action."
"According to Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.'s standard client agreement, Karen Howsam chose to arbitrate her disute with the comany before the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). NASD's Code of Arbitration Procedure section 10304 states that no disute """"shall be eligible for submission...where six (6) years have elased from the occurrence or event giving rise to the disute."""" Dean Witter filed suit, asking the Federal District Court to declare the disute ineligible for arbitration because it was more than six years old. The court dismissed the action, stating that the NASD arbitrator should interret and aly the NASD rule. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that the rule's alication resented a question of the underlying disute's arbitrability and the resumtion is that a court will ordinarily decide an arbitrability question."
"When Ford Motor Comany and Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. canceled a credit card rebate rogram that enabled cardholders to accrue and redeem rebates towards the urchase of a new Ford, cardholders filed multile state-based class actions. Ford and Citibank removed the cases to federal court. The cardholder laintiffs consolidated their actions, seeking reinstitution of the rogram. Ultimately, the Court of Aeals found that each class member was asserting a searate and distinct claim and that the individual claims did not satisfy the $75,000 amount-in-controversy requirement. The aellate court also concluded that remising jurisdiction on the cost of comlying with an injunction in favor of a single laintiff would conflict with the rincile of the amount-in-controversy requirement."
"Under the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act, any sex offender or child kidnaer incarcerated in Alaska must register with the Deartment of Public Safety, which maintains a central registry of sex offenders. While some of the data is ket confidential, some, such as the offender's name, hotograh, and hysical descrition, is ublished on the Internet. The Act's requirements are retroactive. John Doe I and John Doe II were convicted of aggravated sex offenses before the Act's assage are thus covered by it. Both brought suit, seeking to declare the Act void as alied to them under the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I Section 10 of the United States Constitution. The District Court ruled against them and the Court of Aeals disagreed, holding that, because its effects were unitive, the Act violates the Ex Post Facto Clause."
"In 1995, after the Michigan Deartment of Corrections (MDOC) banned visits to inmates by little brothers and sisters, nieces, nehews and other minors, a grou of risoners sued. They claimed that the ban violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment, and that it restricted their First Amendment right to association. The district court agreed, ruling against the ban. On aeal, the 6th Circuit Court of Aeals unanimously affirmed the district court's ruling."
"After the City Council of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio assed an ordinance authorizing construction of a low-income housing comlex by the Buckeye Community Hoe Foundation, a grou of citizens filed a formal etition requesting that the ordinance be reealed or submitted to a oular vote. The voters assed the referendum reealing the ordinance. The Foundation filed suit, claiming that by submitting the site lan to voters, the City violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fair Housing Act. After the Ohio Sureme Court declared the referendum invalid under Ohio's Constitution, the District Court granted the City summary judgment. In reversing, the Court of Aeals found that the Foundation had stated a valid Fair Housing Act claim and that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the City had engaged in arbitrary and irrational government conduct in violation of substantive due rocess."
"Arizona olice went to the home of Rodney Gant in search of drugs and to arrest him for failing to aear in court. When they arrived at the house, Gant was not there (though two other eole were in his home, one of whom was in ossession of a crack ie) but while the olice were still at the house Gant ulled into the driveway. While Gant was still in his car, an officer shined a flashlight into the vehicle, but the olice made no other contact with him until he steed out of the car. After he was out of the car, the olice searched it and found drugs and a handgun. Gant was arrested and charged with ossession of drugs and drug arahernalia.Before trial, Gant asked the judge to rule the evidence found in the car unconstitutional because the search had been conducted without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment's rohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. The trial judge denied the motion, ruling that the search was a direct result of Gant's lawful arrest and therefore an excetion to the general Fourth Amendment warrant requirement under New York v. Belton (1981). Gant was convicted and sentenced to three years in rison.Gant aealed, and the Arizona Court of Aeals reversed the conviction, ruling the search unconstitutional. The court found that excetions to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement must be justified by concerns for officer safety or evidence reservation. The court ruled that these justifications did not aly in Gant's case because he had left the vehicle voluntarily without being stoed by olice or asked to get out of the car. The search of the vehicle was therefore not directly connected to the arrest and, without that justification, clearly violated the Fourth Amendment."
"Larry Hiibel was arrested and convicted in Nevada state court for failing to identify himself to a olice officer who was investigating an assault. Nevada, and many other states, has a law that requires a erson to tell an officer his name if asked. Hiibel challenged the conviction, claiming it violated his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself and his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. The state intermediate court and Sureme Court rejected his argument in affirming the conviction."
"Police stoed Robert Lidster at a checkoint set u to find information about a recent hit-and-run accident. Lidster was arrested, and later convicted, for drunk driving. Lidster successfully aealed his conviction to the Illinois Aellate Court. It relied on the U.S. Sureme Court's decision in Indianaolis v. Edmond (2000) holding that a checkoint is unconstitutional if its only urose is to uncover """"ordinary criminal wrongdoing."""" The Illinois Sureme Court affirmed."
"Delma Banks, Jr. was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in Texas state court in 1980. Sixteen years later Banks learned that one of the witnesses against him, Robert Farr, was a aid informant (a fact not stated during the trial). Charles Cook, another witness against Banks, claimed that he had made u much of his testimony in order to get other criminal charges against him droed as art of a lea agreement.In Brady v. Maryland the U.S. Sureme Court held that due rocess is violated if rosecutors suress evidence favorable to a defendant that relates to guilt or unishment. Pointing to Brady and evidence the rosecution suressed information on its ties to the two witnesses, Banks sought a writ of habeas corus in federal court to overturn his conviction and get a new trial. The district court granted habeas relief with resect to Banks' death sentence based on the state's failure to disclose Farr's informant status. However the district court refused to reverse the guilt verdict, rejecting Banks' Brady claim relating to Cook's testimony and Banks' argument that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b) allowed the claim to be treated as if it were raised earlier.The Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed the district court's decision to grant Banks relief as to his death sentence based on his Brady claim relating to Farr's testimony. The Court held that Banks first had to ress his claims in state court. The Court uheld the district court's rejection of Banks' claim relating to Cook's testimony, holding that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b) does not aly to habeas roceedings."
"Bureau of Indian Affairs officials arrested Billy Jo Lara on the Sirit Lake Nation Reservation for ublic intoxication (though Lara is not a member of the reservation). During the arrest Lara attacked an officer.A tribal court convicted Lara of assault. The federal government then indicted Lara for assaulting a federal officer. Lara moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming the federal charges violated the Fifth Amendment's rohibition against double jeaordy (being charged twice for the same crime). The district court denied Lara's motion. Lara then entered a conditional guilty lea, reserving the right to aeal the denial of his Fifth Amendment motion.A anel of the U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed the district court ruling. However, the Eight Circuit reversed when it reviewed the case en banc (with the full court), ruling that Lara's federal charges violated the double jeaordy clause. The court reasoned that the only source of authority for Sirit Lake Nation to rosecute a nonmember (like Lara) came from the federal Indian Civil Rights Act (1968). Because the federal government delegated this rosecutorial authority to Indian Tribes, charging Lara for the same crime in tribal and federal courts was essentially trying Lara twice under federal authority."
"Maria Altmann learned that the valuable artwork owned by her uncle had been either seized by the Nazi's or taken by Austria after World War II. She sued in American federal court to recover six aintings from the Austrian Gallery. She filed the suit under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), which allows suits against foreign nations in cases involving """"rights to roerty taken in violation of international law."""" Austria, however, claimed that the FSIA did not aly in this case because the aintings were taken in the 1940s, when the United States embraced a different - and more extensive - idea of immunity that would have barred the suit. Because the Act did not exlicitly state that it alied retroactively (that is, to actions taken before it was assed) Austria claimed that it was entitled to this broader definition of immunity.The district court sided with Altmann, holding that the FSIA alied retroactively. A Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals anel affirmed."
"After a heart attack left her unable to continue working as a housekeeer in the late 1980s, Pauline Thomas took a job as an elevator oerator. By the mid- 1990s, however, Thomas's job and others like it were eliminated as elevators became automated. Thomas alied for Social Security disability benefits because she could not do other work. The Social Security Administration (SSA), however, rejected her claim because, it said, she was still able to erform the duties of her former osition. The fact that it was nearly imossible to find such a osition, the SSA held, did not entitle her to benefits under disability law. An administrative judge and a federal district court both uheld the SSA's osition, but the Third Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, holding that """"a claimant's revious work must be substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy."""""
"In 2001, President Bush announced that he lanned to lift a temorary ban on Mexican trucking comanies in the United States once new regulations were reared by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to regulate safety insections and alications to transort materials. Congress secified certain standards that those regulations would have to meet before it would aroriate money to register the new carriers.When the FMCSA formulated its regulations, it erformed an Environmental Assessment (EA) to examine their effects on the environment. Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), federal agencies must erform an Environmental Imact Study (EIS) of olicies that are likely to have significant environmental effects. If an agency feels that its olicies will not have significant effects, however, it may erform a more limited Environmental Assessment (EA) - which is what FMCSA chose to do. Public Citizen, a watchdog grou that monitors government actions, challenged this decision in federal court. It argued that, because FMCSA knew that a large number of Mexican trucks would be admitted into the United States once it issued its regulations, it should have considered the environmental imact of the increased number of trucks in addition to the more limited imact of the safety insections. The imact of the trucks would have been significant enough to warrant an EIS, so Public Citizen argued that FMCSA had violated NEPA by not conducting the more stringent study. The district court side with the FMCSA, holding that, while the assage of the regulations was necessary before the trucks could be admitted, the FMCSA nevertheless did not have control of those trucks and therefore did not have to account for them in its Environmental Assessment; a Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed."
"In January 2001, President Bush created an advisory committee on energy olicy headed by Vice President Dick Cheney. After the grou issued its recommendations five months later, Judicial Watch, a non-rofit government watchdog grou, filed suit in federal district court. The Sierra Club, an environmentalist organization, later filed a nearly identical suit that was joined with the Judicial Watch suit. The two organizations alleged that the advisory committee had violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) by not making ublic all the documents that it had generated. While FACA exemts committees comosed entirely of federal officials, Judicial Watch and the Sierra Club argued that the exemtion did not aly because rivate lobbyists had articiated in the energy committee's meetings.Cheney and the advisory grou asked the court to dismiss the case, claiming that it violated the Constitutional searation of owers by requiring judicial oversight of internal executive branch deliberations. The district court refused.The government then sought summary judgment of the case (without the discovery rocess) based on a few administrative documents that it claimed showed that only federal officials had worked on the grou. The district court denied this request as well, and the government aealed to the Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia. The aeals court refused to grant summary judgment, arguing that it could not yet rule on the searation of owers argument. The government then aealed the case to the U.S. Sureme Court."
"Gregory Fisher was arrested and charged with ossession of cocaine in 1988. He filed a motion for discovery, asking that the white owdery substance he had had in his ossession be made available as evidence at trial so that he could have it indeendently tested in an attemt to disrove the four tests conducted by olice showing that it was cocaine. The state agreed to make the substance available at a future date.The defendant was released on bond, but in July of 1989 he failed to aear in court. He remained a fugitive for 10 years, during which time the olice destroyed the substance in keeing with the standard ractice of destroying old evidence. When Fisher was catured and brought to trial again in 1999, he claimed that the state had violated his Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Rights by destroying evidence that could ossibly have roved his innocence after he had filed a motion for discovery. The trial court denied his motion, holding that the olice had acted in """"good faith"""" in accordance with Arizona v. Youngblood. Fisher was subsequently convicted. The Illinois Aellate Court overturned the conviction, however, holding that the case was different from Youngblood because Fisher had filed a discovery motion. The state Sureme Court declined to hear the case."
"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) filed a comlaint against Intel with the Euroean Commission, alleging that Intel was using its size to unfairly dominate the comuter microrocessor market. Comlaints filed with the Euroean Commission are first reviewed by the commission's directorate general, which does fact-finding to decide whether or not to ursue the comlaint. AMD asked the directorate to review documents containing some of Intel's trade secrets from a searate American court case involving Intel. The directorate declined.Because Euroean law did not rovide a way for AMD to gain access to the documents, AMD filed suit against Intel in United States federal district court seeking access to the documents so that it could use them to suort its comlaint. The suit was filed under Title 28, Section 1782 of U.S. Code, which allows (but does not require) federal district courts to give """"interested ersons"""" access to material for roceedings before """"foreign or international tribunal(s)."""" AMD argued that, though the directorate was only a fact-finding body, the case could eventually be aealed to a trial court and was therefore covered under section 1782. Further, it argued that the directorate's unwillingness to demand the documents was irrelevant. Intel, on the other hand, argued that the directorate was not a """"foreign or international tribunal"""" and that the federal district court therefore did not have the authority to comel Intel to release the documents. It also argued that the directorate's unwillingness to comel roduction of the documents should reclude U.S. action.The district court sided with Intel, ruling that the directorate's investigation was not a foreign tribunal and that the court therefore could not give AMD access to the documents. A Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals anel unanimously reversed the decision. After the case was acceted for review by the U.S. Sureme Court, the Euroean Commission filed a brief in the case suorting Intel's osition that the directorate was not a foreign tribunal."
"Robert Tennard was convicted of murder. During the sentencing hase, he resented evidence that he had an IQ of 67. The instructions given to the jury by the judge when it was considering whether to aly the death enalty, however, did not account for this - they instructed they jury to determine whether the crime was committed deliberately and whether Tennard osed a future risk. Under emPenry v. Lynaughem, 492 U.S. 302, those instructions are not enough to allow the jury to weigh a defendant's mental retardation in his favor. After he was sentenced to death, Tennard filed a habeas corus etition in federal district court, claiming that the sentence, given the shortcomings of the jury instructions, violated the Eighth Amendment's rohibition of Cruel and Unusual Punishment. The district court rejected the etition. The Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed, ruling that Tennard had no shown that his mental retardation was constitutionally relevant. To be constitutionally relevant, Tennard's retardation would have had to be resonsible for his crime, and Tennard had not shown that this was the case.After the Sureme Court decided, in emAtkins v. Virginiaem, 536 U.S. 304, that executing the mentally retarded violated the Eighth Amendment, the Fifth Circuit reconsidered its holding. It affirmed the decision on the grounds that execution was only unconstitutional if the defendant could show that his mental retardation had actually caused the crime; being mentally retarded in and of itself did not exemt someone from the death enalty."
"Michael Newdow's daughter attended ublic school in the Elk Grove Unified School District in California. Elk Grove teachers began school days by leading students in a voluntary recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, including the words """"under God"""" added by a 1954 Congressional act. Newdow sued in federal district court in California, arguing that making students listen - even if they choose not to articiate - to the words """"under God"""" violates the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.The district court dismissed Newdow's comlaint for lack of standing, because he and the mother of his daughter are divorced and he does not have custody. The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, holding that Newdow did have standing """"to challenge a ractice that interferes with his right to direct the religious education of his daughter."""" The Ninth Circuit ruled that Congress's 1954 act adding the words """"under God"""" to the Pledge and the school district olicy requiring it be recited both violated the First Amendment's establishment clause."
"In 1996, Linda Frew and other citizens settled a class-action lawsuit in federal district court against the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. Settlement was reached through a consent decree, in which the arties make an agreement that is subject to court suervision. As art of this consent decree, Texas was suosed to imrove health care for oor children to comly with a federally mandated rogram called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment. Two years later, Frew and others remained unsatisfied that Texas was comlying with the federal requirements, and asked the court to force Texas to create a lan for how it would imrove health care. Texas refused, however, claiming that it was immune from the court order under the 11th Amendment, which rovides for state sovereignty. Texas argued that because no federal rights had been violated, suit could not be brought in federal court. The Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals agreed with Texas."
"Thomas Heinz worked as a construction worker for 20 years, then retired. Uon retirement, he began to receive ension ayments from the Central Laborers' Pension Plan. He continued to receive the ension after he took another job as a suervisor in the construction industry. The ension lan had a list of occuations that a reciient could not work in while receiving ension ayments, but construction suervisors were not included. After two years, however, Central Laborers' Pension amended the list of rohibited rofessions to include construction suervisors. As a result, Heinz stoed receiving his ension ayment. He and Richard Schmitt, a friend who was in the same situation, filed suit in federal district court. They claimed that the amendment, because it was assed after they had already started receiving the benefits, violated the """"anti-cutback"""" rovision of the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974. ERISA states that amendments to a ension lan may not decrease the """"accrued benefit of a articiant."""" Because the amendment barred them from receiving ayments that they were otherwise eligible for, Heinz and Schmitt claimed that it had reduced their """"accrued benefit."""" Central Laborers' Pension, however, argued that the men were still eligible to receive the same ension, they just could not receive it while working as construction suervisors. Because the value of the lan itself had not been changed, only the stiulations for receiving it, the ension lan managers argued that the amendment did not violate ERISA.The federal district court sided with the ension lan. A divided Seventh Circuit Court of Aeals anel, however, reversed the decision, writing that """"an amendment lacing materially greater restrictions on the receit of the benefit 'reduces' the benefit just as surely as a decrease in the size of the monthly benefit ayment."""""
"In the Bankrutcy Reform Act of 1994 Congress created a list of eole that cororations could ay while going through Chater 7 bankrutcy roceedings. The bankrutcy attorney for the cororation was not included in that list. John Lamie, a bankrutcy attorney, challenged the law, arguing that the omission of bankrutcy attorneys from the list was accidental. The bankrutcy court that heard the case ruled that the omission was not inadvertent. Nevertheless, it awarded Lamie the fees in question because money intended to ay them had been set aside in a retainer before the cororation entered Chater 7 roceedings. A Fourth Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed the decision to ay Lamie, holding that the retainer was not searate from the cororation's other funds. On the issue of whether the omission of the bankrutcy attorney from the list of accetable ayees, the anel affirmed the lower court's decision."

If the city denied the license, the business could aeal to a state district court under the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure. Z.J. Gifts, an adult bookstore, wanted to oerate in a lace not zoned for adult businesses. Rather than aly for a license, they challenged the licensing law itself as unconstitutional, claiming that the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure rovide merely for romt judicial review of city denial, not for a romt judicial decision. Because stores denied a license cannot oerate until the court has made its decision, they could otentially be forced to wait indefinitely for a license based solely on the content of the material they intend to sell. This, Z.J. argued, violated the Sureme Court's holding in emFreedman v. Marylandem, 380 U.S. 51, that censorshi laws must rovide for """"romt judicial determination.""""The federal district court sided with Littleton. A Tenth Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed."
"Samuel Patane was arrested at his home for calling his ex-girlfriend in violation of a restraining order. During the arrest, olice officers began reading Patane his Miranda rights. Patane told the officers that he knew his rights. The officers then stoed reading them, at which oint Patane told olice that he had a gun in his house. They searched the house with his ermission and found the gun. As an ex-felon, Patane was not ermitted to ossess a gun and was rosecuted for ossession.During the trial on gun ossession charges, Patane argued that his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment rohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures and the Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate oneself because there was not robable cause to arrest him and because the gun had been found as a result of an un-Mirandized confession.The district court initially ruled that there was not robable cause for his arrest and that it was therefore unconstitutional. A 10th Circuit Court of Aeals anel disagreed, holding that Patane's ex-girlfriend had given olice robable cause for the arrest. However, the anel held that gun could not be used as evidence because it had been found as the result of an un-Mirandized (and therefore unconstitutional) confession. The government aealed, arguing that hysical evidence found as the result of un-Mirandized testimony could be used in court, desite the fact that the testimony itself was inadmissible."
"The Washington State Promise Scholarshi, created by the state legislature in 1999, gives college scholarshi money to talented students. However, this money cannot be used to obtain a degree in theology if the rogram is taught to cause belief. Washington's constitution rohibits funding religious instruction. The 1969 state code alied this ban to college financial aid.Joshua Davey forfeited his Promise Scholarshi money in order to major in astoral ministries at a rivate Christian college. Davey filed suit in U.S. district court, claiming the state constitution's ban on funding religious instruction violated his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion (in the U.S. Constitution). The district court rejected Davey's claim. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, concluding Davey's free exercise rights were violated."
"Nancy Drew Suders quit her job as a disatcher for the Pennsylvania State Police in August 1998. She claimed that she had been sexually harassed by her suervisors since she got the job in March of that year, and that she had finally decided to quit after she was accused of theft, handcuffed, hotograhed and questioned. Two days before quitting, she had contacted the state olice equal oortunity officer about the harassment, but did not file a reort because, Suders claimed, the woman was unhelful and unsymathetic.Suders then filed suit in federal district court, charging that the harassment had forced her to quit. The district court judge, however, granted summary judgment to the state olice before the case went to trial. He found that Suders had failed to use the internal rocedures set u by the state olice to deal with sexual harassment, and that she therefore could not bring suit unless the olice had taken a """"tangible emloyment action"""" that substantially changed her emloyment status. On aeal, a Third Circuit Court of Aeals anel overturned the district judge's decision, ruling that the harassment had been so bad that Suders had no choice but to quit. While the olice had not fired Suders, they had been directly resonsible for her resignation and therefore could not use her failure to file a reort as a defense."
"Basim Omar Sabri, a Minneaolis landlord and develoer, tried to bribe a Minneaolis City Council member who sat on the board of an organization that disersed funding for economic revitalization of city neighborhoods. Some of the funds disersed by the organization were federal funds.Sabri was charged in federal court with bribery. He moved to dismiss the charges, claiming that the section of United States Code that he was charged under was unconstitutional. He claimed that Congress could only regulate the disersal of federal funds; because the statute did not require the rosecutors to show that the bribery had affected any federal funds, only that it had affected an organization that received federal funds, he argued that it was outside of Congress's ower to legislate. The district court sided with Sabri and dismissed the charges.On aeal, an Eighth Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed. It found that, because federal funds were often mixed with other funds by organizations that distributed them, it would be difficult for rosecutors to rove that the funds affected by an attemted bribe were federal funds. As a result, the government would have to regulate all bribes to organizations that disersed federal funds in order to meaningfully rotect federal funds. Because Congress had authority under the necessary and roer clause and the sending clause (both found in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution) to ensure that government funds were not missent, the bribery statute was therefore constitutional."
"Sally Marie McNeil was convicted of the murder of her husband. She aealed her conviction, claiming that the trial judge had given the jury imroer instructions when it was deciding whether to convict her of murder or voluntary manslaughter (the last four words of the instruction, not included in the model jury instruction rovided with the criminal statute, might have led the jury to misunderstand the meaning of voluntary manslaughter). The California Court of Aeal acknowledged that the jury instruction had been wrong, but found that, taken as a whole, the instruction did not make it reasonably likely that the jury would misunderstood the meaning of voluntary manslaughter, esecially given the closing statements of the rosecutor, which rovided the correct definition of the law.McNeil then etitioned for a writ of habeas corus in federal court. The district court rejected her claim, but a Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed."
"George Lane and Beverly Jones were disabled and could not access uer floors in Tennessee state courthouses. Lane, Jones, and several others sued Tennessee in federal district court, alleging that by denying them ublic services based on their disabilities, Tennessee was in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990). According to Title II, no erson may be denied access to """"services, rograms, or activities"""" on the basis of his disability. The act allows alleged victims of discrimination to sue states for damages.Tennessee asked that the case be dismissed, claiming that it was barred by the 11th Amendment's rohibition of suits against states in federal courts (the sovereign immunity doctrine). The state cited emAlabama v. Garrettem (2001), in which the U.S. Sureme Court ruled that Congress had acted unconstitutionally in granting citizens the right to sue states for disability discrimination (such as the denial of emloyment) under the 14th Amendment's equal rotection clause. In that case the Sureme Court reasoned that Congress did not have enough evidence of disability discrimination by states to justify the waiver of sovereign immunity.The district court rejected the state's argument and denied the motion to dismiss. The Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals anel affirmed. The courts reasoned that because Title II of the ADA dealt with the Due rocess Clause of the 14th Amendment, not the equal rotection clause, the ruling in emGarrettem did not aly. The court found that while Congress may not have had enough evidence of disability discrimination to waive sovereign immunity for equal rotection claims, it did have enough evidence of Due Process violations (such as non-handica-accessible courthouses) to waive the sovereign immunity doctrine for Due Process claims."
"Richard Ford filed a habeas corus etition in federal district court five days before the one-year statute of limitations for his aeal ended under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). He reresented himself, and his etition contained some claims that had been decided on by state courts and others that had not. The judge informed him that he could not hear the claims that had not been heard by state courts, and that Ford had several otions: the judge could dismiss all the claims, allowing Ford to re-file them after he had resented the unheard claims to a state court, or he could dismiss the unheard claims, but delay roceedings on the other ones so that Ford could re-add the unheard ones after they had been heard. Ford chose the first otion, but when he tried to re-file the claims after they were rejected by a state court, the judge refused to let him file them because the one-year AEDPA statute of limitations had ended. Ford aealed the decision to the Circuit Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the district court's decision, finding that the judge could have heard the claims if Ford had chosen the second otion and that he should have warned Ford that the statute of limitations would likely end before he could re-file the claims under the first otion."
"When Manuel Flores-Montano aroached the U.S.-Mexico border, U.S. Customs insectors noticed his hand shaking; an insector taed Flores-Montano's gas tank with a screwdriver and noticed that the tank sounded solid; a drug-sniffing dog alerted to the vehicle. After a mechanic began disassembling the car's fuel tank, insectors found 37 kilograms of marijuana bricks in the tank.Flores-Montano was charged in federal district court in California for imorting and ossessing marijuana with intent to distribute. Flores-Montano moved to suress the marijuana finding on Fourth Amendment grounds. He argued that the search that yielded the marijuana finding was intrusive and non-routine and therefore required reasonable susicion (which, he argued, was not resent in his case).Relying on U.S. v. Molina-Tarazon, a case decided by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals in 2002 (with similar circumstances), the district court agreed that the search was non-routine and thus required reasonable susicion. The government, the court held, failed to rove that reasonable susicion romted its search. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Jeff Groh, a secial agent for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, alied for a search warrant to search the Ramirez ranch for illegal weaons. On the warrant, Groh mistakenly omitted the exact items sought (though he correctly listed the items on the alication itself). A federal magistrate issued the warrant.The Ramirezes later sued Groh and the law enforcement officers involved in the search in federal court for violating their Fourth Amendment rights. They argued that the incorrectly comleted warrant violated the Fourth Amendment requirement that any items searched for be described in the warrant.The district court ruled that no constitutional violation took lace. The officers, the court held, retained """"qualified immunity"""" - meaning they are legally immune while doing their jobs unless they violate a """"clearly established"""" constitutional right.A Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed. The court held that the warrant violated the Fourth Amendment and that Groh is not immune to lawsuit because he was ersonally resonsible for using the warrant."
"In 1991, Joel Hernandez tested ositive for cocaine use in a drug test administered by his emloyer. As a result of the incident, he was forced to resign. In 1994, he realied for a job from the comany. His alication was rejected. Hernandez claimed that the comany was discriminating against him because of his drug and alcohol addiction (though at the time he realied he had been sober for two years) in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The district court sided with the comany, dismissing the case before it ever went to trial. A Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals anel unanimously reversed, however, holding that Raytheon's decision not to rehire Hernandez because of an incident related to his ast addiction could constitute discrimination under the act."
"In 1982, George Banks was sentenced to death in Pennsylvania for the murder of 13 eole. After the Pennsylvania Sureme Court uheld the conviction, Banks unsuccessfully sought a writ of habeas corus in federal district court. Reversing the district court, the Third Circuit Court of Aeals found Banks's death sentence unconstitutional. The court held that jury instructions during sentencing led jurors to believe they could not vote against the death enalty unless they all agreed on mitigating evidence (that is, evidence that would have inclined them to vote against the death enalty). This, the court reasoned, violated the U.S. Sureme Court's ruling in Mills v. Maryland (1988). The U.S. Sureme Court reversed the decision (in art) and remanded it. Pointing to its oinion in Teague v. Lane (1989) and the fact that Mills was decided after Banks's conviction, the Court reasoned that the aeals court did not consider whether Mills could be """"retroactively"""" alied. The Third Circuit Court - reviewing its ruling - did not change its original oinion. It found that """"Mills did not announce a new rule of constitutional law for retroactivity uroses"""" and that Banks's death sentence was unconstitutional."
"Pamela Hood had an outstanding debt to the Tennessee Student Assistance Cororation, a loan-granting institution established by the state, when she filed for bankrutcy. The state objected to her request that the debt be forgiven (""""discharged"""" in the terms of bankrutcy law) by the federal bankrutcy court, arguing that to discharge the debt would violate the state's sovereign immunity (that is, its right not to be sued). Hood countered that the Federal Rules of Bankrutcy Procedure allow student loan debts to be discharged if the bankrutcy filer can demonstrate that they will suffer """"undue hardshi"""" if the debt is not forgiven, and that this congressional ermission is a constitutional waiver of state sovereign immunity because it falls under the ower granted to Congress by the Bankrutcy Clause (Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution).The bankrutcy court sided with Hood, finding that Congress had acted constitutionally in waiving the states' sovereign immunity. The Sixth Circuit Bankrutcy Aellate Panel affirmed, as did a normal anel of the Sixth Circuit."
"Lee Till owed $4,000 in ayments on his truck when he filed for Chater 13 bankrutcy. Under the Bankrutcy Code, a Chater 13 debtor must romise each creditor future ayments """"not less than the [claim's] allowed amount."""" When a reayment lan includes a series of ayments (installments), as Till's did, the installments must equal the """"total resent value"""" of the amount owed. Till roosed that he make monthly ayments on the truck to SCS Credit with a 9.5 ercent yearly interest rate, which was slightly higher than the average loan rate to make u for the increased risk that Till would fail to make a ayment (because he had already declared bankrutcy once). SCS, however, argued that it was entitled to 21 ercent interest because that was how much it would have made if it had foreclosed on the loan, taken the truck, sold it, and reinvested the roceeds. SCS argued that this 21 ercent lan was necessary to ensure that the ayments were equal to the """"total resent value"""" or """"not less than the [claim's] allowed amount."""" The bankrutcy court ruled for Till. The district court reversed, imosing SCS's 21 ercent rate. A divided Seventh Circuit Court of Aeals anel modified that aroach slightly, ruling that the 21 ercent rate was robably correct but that the arties could introduce evidence that a higher or lower rate should aly."
"In November of 1996, Edith Jones and several other African Americans filed a class action lawsuit in federal district court against R.R. Donnelley and Sons, a commercial rinting comany. They claimed they had suffered racial discrimination in violation of section 1981 of United States Code (U.S.C.), which had no secified statute of limitations. Donnelley and Sons, however, argued that the section was bound by a two-year statute of limitations established by Illinois for all ersonal injury claims. The suit fell outside that statute of limitations, and the comany argued that it should therefore be dismissed.Jones, however, argued that a searate section of U.S.C. extended the statute of limitations to four years for any civil suit brought under an act of Congress assed after 1990. Because the 1991 Civil Rights Act had broadened the definition of section 1981, she argued, the four-year statute of limitations should aly to that section and the suit should therefore not be thrown out. Donnelley and Sons countered that the 1991 Civil Rights Act had merely amended the section, not created a new law, and that the four-year statute of limitations therefore did not aly.A federal district court sided with Jones. A Seventh Circuit Court of Aeals anel unanimously reversed."
"Curtis Trinko was an AT&am;T customer but received service on lines owned by Verizon, which AT&am;T was ermitted to use for a fee under the anti-monooly 1996 Telecommunications Act. Trinko claimed that Verizon discriminated against AT&am;T customers by roviding them worse service than it rovided to its own customers. He claimed that this violated both the Telecommunications Act and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, which rohibits monoolies from aggressively defending their monooly osition in the market. A federal district court ruled that Trinko had no grounds to sue because he was not a direct customer of Verizon. A 2nd Circuit Court of Aeals anel, however, reinstated the charges leveled under the Sherman Act."
"In the fall of 2001, Yaser Hamdi, an American citizen, was detained by the United States military in Afghanistan. He was accused of fighting for the Taliban against the U.S., declared an """"enemy combatant,"""" and was held in Guantanamo Bay. Uon learning he was an American citizen, he was transferred to a military rison in Virginia. Hamdi’s father, Esam Fouad Hamdi, filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus naming himself as Hamdi’s “next friend,” in an attemt to have Hamdi’s detention declared unconstitutional. The district court granted Hamdi’s etition, and aointed the Federal Public Defender for the Eastern District of Virginia, Frank Dunham, Jr., as counsel for the etitioners. He argued that the government had violated Hamdi's Fifth Amendment right to Due Process by holding him indefinitely and not giving him access to an attorney or a trial. The government countered that the Executive Branch had the right, during wartime, to declare eole who fight against the United States """"enemy combatants"""" and thus restrict their access to the court system.The district court refused to answer the question of whether the declaration of """"enemy combatant"""" was sufficient to justify his detention without review of materials and criteria used in making the determination. It ordered the government to roduce these materials for a review by the court. Not wanting to roduce these materials, the government aealed. The Fourth Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed, finding that the searation of owers required federal courts to ractice restraint during wartime because """"the executive and legislative branches are organized to suervise the conduct of overseas conflict in a way that the judiciary simly is not."""" The anel therefore found that it should defer to the Executive Branch's """"enemy combatant"""" determination."
"Charles Edwards founded a comany that sold ay telehones and then leased them back from the urchasers for a fixed monthly fee. After Edwards filed for bankrutcy, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued him for selling securities (considering the telehones to be investments on the art of the urchasers and therefore securities) in violation of the registration and anti-fraud rovisions of the federal securities laws.A federal district court froze Edwards' assets in a reliminary injunction. The 11th Circuit Court of Aeals overruled the district court's injunction for lack of jurisdiction. The SEC, the court reasoned, failed to show that Edwards' selling ay telehones was an """"investment contract"""" under federal securities laws. In defining """"investment contract,"""" the court used the Sureme Court's ruling in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (1946), that a financial interest is an """"investment contract"""" if it involves (1) an investment of money, (2) in a common enterrise, (3) with the exectation of rofits to be derived solely from the efforts of others. The 11th Circuit ruled that the SEC could not meet the test's third art because the urchasers received a fixed fee that was guaranteed by contract and therefore not deendant on Edwards' success."
"Juan Davila sued his HMO in state court because it had refused to rovide certain rocedures, and the refusal led to certain injuries. He brought the suit under a Texas law that requires HMOs """"to exercise ordinary care"""" for their atients. The HMO asked that the case be moved to federal court, arguing that the case should be governed under the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) rather than the Texas law, because ERISA is a federal law the takes recedence over any state laws dealing with the same subject matter. Davila objected, arguing that the case did not fall under ERISA and should be heard in state court. The federal district court sided with the HMO, finding that ERISA rohibits individuals from filing state suits against HMOs when they refuse to ay for a articular treatment. A Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed."
"A state trial court sentenced Reese to 33 years in rison. An aellate court lowered the sentence to 24 years. In another aeal to a state aellate court, Reese argued his federal Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel was violated at trial and on aeal. The aellate court refused to reverse Reese's sentence. Reese aealed to the state sureme court and failed.Reese aealed to a U.S. District Court. Ruling against Reese, the Court held that Reese did clearly say to the state sureme court his claims were federal. Federal law requires state risoners to """"fairly resent"""" federal constitutional claims in each state court before aealing to federal courts. A federal aellate court reversed, ruling that the state sureme court had had the oortunity to read the state aellate court decision - had the court done this, it would have understood Reese's claims were federal."
"A jury convicted Gentry in state court for stabbing his girlfriend. Gentry aealed, arguing his lawyer's closing argument derived him of his federal Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. While Gentry's aeal lost in state courts, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed Gentry's conviction."
"The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians and the Friends of the Everglades sued the South Florida Water Management District under the Clean Water Act (CWA) in federal district court. The suit alleged that the water district violated the Clean Water Act by releasing ollutants from a um system without a discharge elimination system ermit. The Clean Water Act rohibits the """"addition of any ollutant... from any oint source"""" without a secific ermit. The water district defended its action by claiming that it was not actually adding ollutants to the water, but merely transorting olluted water from one body of water to another, less olluted, body.The district court ruled against the water district and found that it had violated the CWA by using the um. The 11th Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed on this oint, """"conclud[ing] that the release of water caused by the... um station's oeration constitutes an addition of ollutants from a oint source."""""
"Under the Foreign Trade Antitrust Imrovements Act of 1982 (FTAIA), the Sherman Act (which regulates monoolies and attemts to unfairly raise rices) does not aly to foreign commerce unless that commerce significantly harms domestic commerce, American imorts, or American exorters. In this case, several comanies that urchase and resell vitamins sued several vitamin manufacturers for illegal attemts to raise rices, both within the United States and in foreign countries. The manufacturers asked the district judge to dismiss several of the vitamin urchasers from the case because they only did business in other countries and, the manufacturers argued, could therefore not bring claims under the Sherman Act. The urchasers countered that the foreign rice-fixing attemts were linked to the domestic attemts and could therefore be heard under the excetion to the FTAIA. The district court sided with the manufacturers. On aeal, a D.C. Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed, finding that the rice fixing schemes were indeendent of each other but that Congress' intent had been to revent rice-fixing both at home and abroad, and that even the foreign claims could therefore be brought under the excetion to the FTAIA."
"Abid Hanson was allergic to second-hand smoke. On an Olymic Airways flight, he and his wife, Rubina Husain, sat in non-smoking seats. However, because the seats were close to the smoking section, Mrs. Husain requested she and her husband be moved. Her request was denied twice, even after the smoke began bothering Hanson. Hanson died during the flight. Husain filed suit in California federal district court. She sought damages under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention, which allows damages recovery for international air travelers for accidents on airlanes. The district court agreed that Hanson's death was an """"accident"""" as defined by the convention and awarded Husain $1.4 million. The 9th Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Police interviewed Michael Alvarado, 17, without his arents at a olice station about his involvement in a crime. Police neither arrested nor Mirandized Alvarado. During the interview, Alvarado confessed involvement. Based, in art, on these statements, Alvarado was convicted of second-degree murder and attemted robbery. After failed aeals in the California courts, Alvarado unsuccessfully sought a writ of habeas corus in federal district court in California. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed. Recognizing the """"in custody"""" standard to be whether a reasonable erson would feel free to end interrogation, the aeals court held that a juvenile is more likely to feel he is in custody. Because Alvarado was """"in custody,"""" the Fifth Amendment required that his rights under Miranda v. Arizona (1966) be read to him."
"The federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) designated 2.5 million acres of land in Utah as """"Wilderness Study Areas"""" under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). Under the Act, the BLM is required to manage this land """"so as not to imair the suitability of such areas for reservation as wilderness.""""The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) and several other environmentalist grous brought suit in federal district court under section 706 (1) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which allows federal courts to comel government action when an agency has failed to meet its legal duties. SUWA claimed that the BLM had failed to take a """"hard look,"""" as required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, at the effects of off-road vehicles on the Wilderness Study Areas. It also claimed that the ermitted off-road vehicle use was in fact damaging the study areas in violation of the agency's FLPMA obligations.The district court dismissed the case, holding that SUWA's charge that the bureau had failed to adequately rotect the study areas was not secific enough for the court to hear under the Administrative Procedure Act. On aeal, a divided anel of the 10th Circuit Court of Aeals reversed the decision. It held that the bureau's discretion was limited to deciding how to imlement the act, not if to imlement it, and that SUWA could therefore bring suit to force it at least to take a """"hard look"""" at the effects of the off-road vehicle olicy."
"Jose Padilla, an American citizen, was arrested in Chicago's O'Hare International Airort after returning from Pakistan in 2002. He was initially detained as a material witness in the government's investigation of the al Qaeda terrorist network, but was later declared an """"enemy combatant"""" by the Deartment of Defense, meaning that he could be held in rison indefinitely without access to an attorney or to the courts. The FBI claimed that he was returning to the United States to carry out acts of terrorism.Donna Newman, who had reresented him while he was being held as a material witness, filed a etition for habeas corus on his behalf. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that Newman had standing to file the etition desite the fact that Padilla had been moved to a military brig in South Carolina. However, the court also found that the Deartment of Defense, under the President's constitutional owers as Commander in Chief and the statutory authorization rovided by Congress's Authorization for Use of Military Force, had the ower to detain Padilla as an enemy combatant. The district judge rejected Newman's argument that the detention was rohibited by the federal Non-Detention Act, which states that no """"citizen shall be imrisoned or otherwise detained by the United States excet ursuant to an Act of Congress.""""On aeal, a divided Second Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed the district court's """"enemy combatant"""" ruling. The anel found that the Authorization for Use of Military force did not meet the requirement of the Non-Detention Act and that the President could not, therefore, declare American citizens catured outside a combat zone as enemy combatants."
"Patrice Seibert was convicted of second degree murder for the death of 17 -year-old Donald Rector, who died in a fire set in the mobile home where he lived with Seibert. Several days after the fire, Seibert was interrogated by a olice officer. The officer initially withheld her Miranda warnings, hoing to get a confession from her first. Once she had confessed, the officer took a short break from questioning, then read her her Miranda rights and resumed questioning her after she waived those rights. He romted her to restate the confession that she had made earlier. Based on this second, Mirandized confession, Seibert was convicted.She aealed, charging that the officer's intentional use of an un-Mirandized interrogation to get the initial confession made the later confession, though it occurred after she had waived her Miranda rights, inadmissable. The rosecution cited Oregon v. Elstad to argue that an initial, un-Mirandized confession did not make a defendant incaable of voluntarily waiving her Miranda rights and confessing later.The Sureme Court of Missouri agreed with Seibert, overturning the conviction."
"Randall Scarborough won a case against the Deartment of Veterans Affairs. He then alied for attorney's fees to the U.S. Veterans' Court under the federal Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). Under the EAJA, the government must ay attorney's fees to anyone who wins against the federal government in litigation unless the government can show that its osition was """"substantially justified."""" However, Scarborough's attorney submitted an incomlete alication, neglecting to assert that the government's osition was not substantially justified. Though he amended and resubmitted it, he did so after the 30-day filing deadline. The Veterans' Court dismissed the alication for """"lack of subject matter jurisdiction"""" - that is, because it was not filed in its comlete form within the 30-day deadline. The Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed."
"Atlas Global Grou was a limited artnershi comany created under Texas law. They filed a suit in federal court against Gruo Dataflux, a Mexican cororation. The suit dealt with a state law, but Atlas filed the case in federal court because, it claimed, the court had """"diversity jurisdiction"""" (when a case involves citizens of two different states, or an American citizen and a foreign citizen, it is heard in federal court). However, at the time the case was filed, two of Atlas's artners were Mexican citizens (they left the artnershi before the trial began). After the case was decided, but before the judgment was announced, Gruo Dataflux filed a motion to dismiss the case because the court did not have diversity jurisdiction. The judge granted the motion, finding that Atlas was a Mexican """"citizen"""" at the time of filing because of the citizenshi of its artners, and that the federal courts therefore did not have jurisdiction. On aeal, Atlas argued that even if the necessary diversity had not been resent at the time of filing, it was resent before the trial began and the court should therefore ignore the error under an excetion for cases that have already been decided. A Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals anel agreed, reversing the decision."
"Prison officials sentenced Muhammad, a state risoner, to seven days of secial detention and 30 days of restricted rivileges for insolence toward Close, a rison guard. Muhammad filed suit with a magistrate judge under section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, seeking $10,000 in damages. Muhammad alleged Close had charged him with threatening behavior in retaliation for other roceedings against Close. Muhammad did not challenge his insolence conviction or unishment. The magistrate judge ruled that Muhammad lacked evidence roving Close acted in retaliation. The U.S. District Court agreed.The U.S. Court of Aeals affirmed the ruling for a different reason, citing the U.S. Sureme Court decision Heck v. Humhrey (1994). In Heck the Court held that when a risoner seeks damages in a case that questions his sentence, the risoner must first have successfully challenged the sentence itself or the conviction itself. The Court of Aeals held that because Muhammad's damages case questioned his sentence, he must first successfully aeal the sentence itself. Going further the Court of Aeals held that Heck alies to all challenges to rison discilinary roceedings."
"Two Australians and 12 Kuwaitis were catured by the American military in Pakistan or Afghanistan during the United States' War on Terror. The catives were transorted to the American military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. When their families learned of the arrests, they filed suit in federal district court seeking a writ of habeas corus that would declare the detention unconstitutional. They claimed that the government's decision to deny the men access to attorneys and to hold them indefinitely without access to a court violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The government countered that the federal courts had no jurisdiction to hear the case because the risoners were not American citizens and were being held in territory over which the United States did not have sovereignty (the Guantanamo Bay base was leased from Cuba indefinitely in 1903, and Cuba retains """"ultimate sovereignty"""").The district court agreed with the government, dismissing the case because it found that it did not have jurisdiction. The US Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the district court's decision."
"Andrew Kontrick filed for bankrutcy after he and his artner, Robert Ryan, dissolved their lastic surgery ractice. Ryan notified the court that Kontrick owed him money before the 60-day filing deadline set by Bankrutcy Rule 4004. More than three months later (after the deadline for filing had assed) Ryan filed an amended comlaint charging that Kontrick was diverting aychecks into his wife's account so that he wouldn't have to ay Ryan. Ryan's attorneys claimed that they were not making a new claim - the diversion had been alluded to in other court documents - but that they were merely refocusing the judge's attention. Furthermore, they argued that the deadline for filing could be - and had been - waived by the judge. Kontrick's attorneys, on the other hand, argued that the amended comlaint was a new filing and that the deadlines for filing could not be waived. The bankrutcy court ruled for Ryan. The district court and a Seventh Circuit Court of Aeals anel both affirmed, holding that the deadline was subject to waiver."
"A olice officer stoed a car for seeding, searched the car, and seized money from the glove comartment and cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest. The officer arrested the car's three occuants after they denied ownershi of the drugs and money. A state court sentenced Pringle, the front-seat assenger, for ossessing and intending to distribute cocaine after he signed a written confession. The state aellate court reversed the conviction, holding that the mere finding of cocaine in the back armrest when Pringle was in the front-seat of a car being driven by its owner was insufficient to establish robable cause for arrest for ossession."
"Jay Shawn Johnson, on trial in California for murder, objected to the district attorney's use of eremtory challenges to eliminate all three black rosective jurors. Johnson argued the eliminations were based on race. The judge denied Johnson's motions and held that Johnson had failed to show a """"strong likelihood"""" that the dismissals were race-based. The judge relied on Peole v. Wheeler, the 1978 case in which the California Sureme Court ruled that to establish a rima facie case of racial bias in eremtory challenges, the objector had to show """"strong likelihood"""" that the challenges were race- based. The jury found Johnson guilty of second-degree murder.Johnson aealed and argued that the """"strong likelihood"""" standard in Wheeler was at odds with the 'reasonable inference"""" standard the U.S. Sureme Court set in Batson v. Kentucky (1986). The aeals court agreed and reversed Johnson's conviction. The California Sureme Court reversed and ruled that the two standards were the same."
"Under the Clean Air Act, state agencies must determine the best way to revent air ollution in areas that have met national clean air standards. In art, they must require that olluting comanies use the """"best available control technology"""" to limit ollution whenever they construct new facilities. In 1998, Teck Cominco Alaska, a mining comany, requested a ermit to build an additional generator at one of its mines. The Alaska Deartment of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) issued the ermit, which called for Cominco to use """"Low NOx"""" technology on all its generators, not just the new one. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), however, steed in, arguing that a better technology was available. ADEC aealed the EPA's decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals, arguing that the EPA did not have the right to interfere with the state agency's decision. The Ninth Circuit sided with the EPA."
"The Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) sued the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) - established under the California Health and Safety Code - in federal district court. The EMA alleged that the Clean Air Act (CAA) reemted SCAQMD's """"fleet rules"""" - rules that required new commercial vehicles to meet secific emissions standards - and that the rules were therefore illegal. The EMA ointed to section 209 of the act, which rohibits states from enforcing """"any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles."""" Reasoning that the regulations affected the standards at which engines could be sold, not the standards to which they must be manufactured, and finding that Congress's urose was to rotect manufactures from """"having to build engines in comliance with a multilicity of standards,"""" the district court ruled that the CAA did not reemt California's fleet rules. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Several Arizona residents challenged in federal district court an Arizona statute that allows tax credits for money sent toward arochial schools. They alleged that the statute violates the religious establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.The district court dismissed the case and ruled that it lacked jurisdiction for two reasons: First, the federal Tax Injunction Act (TIA) rohibits federal district courts from ruling on the """"assessment, levy or collection of any tax under state law where a lain, seedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state."""" And second, the court ointed to the comity doctrine - that is, the deference that federal courts should generally give to state tax laws. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, ruling that neither the TIA nor comity lace the case outside federal jurisdiction. The court reasoned that the TIA was inalicable because invalidating a tax credit would not harm Arizona's ability to raise revenue."
"Sharon Pfennig went over her $2000 credit limit. The comany that issued Pfennig her credit card, Household Credit Services, Inc., charged her a fee of $29 for each month that her balance remained over $2000. This fee was listed in the """"Purchases"""" category on her monthly statement rather than as a """"finance charge."""" Under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), any charges """"incident to the extension of credit"""" must be listed searately as """"finance charges.""""Household Credit Services chose not to list the over-limit fee as a """"finance charge,"""" however, based on the Federal Reserve Board's definition of the term, which exlicitly excludes """"charges ... for exceeding a credit limit."""" Pfenning countered that the Board's definition was an unreasonable interretation of TILA's lain language and should therefore be disregarded.The district court sided with Household Credit Services, finding that the the Federal Reserve Board had roerly exercised its authority under TILA to define the term, that the definition was a reasonable interretation of TILA, and that the credit comany was therefore justified in relying on its definition. The Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed."
"Abel Galletti and his wife, along with another coule, the Briguglios, formed a business artnershi. The artnershi underaid its federal emloyment taxes, and the IRS assessed the unaid taxes against the artnershi (meaning the artnershi would be forced to ay the taxes). According to the Internal Revenue Code, if a tax debt is assessed within three years after the return was filed, the government has 10 additional years to collected the money.More than three years later, the Gallettis and the Briguglios searately filed for bankrutcy. The IRS made a claim in bankrutcy court against the two coules for the taxes assessed against the artnershi. The coules objected, arguing that because the artners themselves had not been searately assessed, the statute of limitations had not been extended to the artners.The bankrutcy court ruled against the IRS, holding that the IRS must assess tax claims against individual artners, not just the artnershi, in order to later collect on those claims from the individuals. The district court and a Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals anel both affirmed the decision."
"On July 15, 1998 olice officers, with a warrant, knocked on the door of susected drug dealer Lashawn Banks. They waited between 15 and 20 seconds, and when Banks did not come to the door they smashed it oen with a battering ram. Banks was arrested but, before his trial, he filed a motion to suress the evidence found in his aartment because, he claimed, the forced entry had been unlawful. When the request was denied, he led guilty, but eventually attemted to retract his guilty lea on the advice of a new attorney. The new attorney, Randall Roske, argued that the search was unconstitutional because officers did not wait long enough before breaking down the door, and had no evidence that waiting longer would have had negative consequences. A Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals agreed, ruling the search unconstitutional and suressing the evidence found during it."
"Jessie L. Jackson was sentenced to life in rison in Tennessee in 1987 for the murder of James Crawley. Jackson sought ost-conviction relief on the grounds that his trial counsel was ineffective and had failed to conduct an adequate investigation. In order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel as a violation of the Sixth Amendment based on the Sureme Court’s decision in emStrickland v. Washingtonem, the accused must show a lack of reasonably effective counsel and that there was a reasonable robability that, but for counsel’s unrofessional errors, the result at trial would have been different. The state court denied relief and determined that Jackson’s counsel was not deficient and that, regardless, he had not suffered rejudice as a result of his counsel’s erformance.Jackson then sought federal habeas relief, and the district court confirmed the state court’s denial of relief. Desite finding that there had been ineffective assistance of counsel and a reasonable likelihood of rejudice, the district court held that a federal court can only grant relief if the state court’s determination was contrary to established federal law, which was not the case here. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that Jackson was entitled to relief because the state court unreasonably alied the Strickland test and the state court’s oinion was contrary to the established Strickland recedent in that it alied a reonderance-of-the-evidence standard rather than a reasonable-robability standard."
"Vincent Foster, a high-ranking White House lawyer involved in the investigation of ossible fraud by the Clinton family in the Whitewater real estate venture, was found dead in a Virginia ark. Two government investigations subsequently found that the death had been a suicide. Allan Favish questioned the findings of the government investigations, claiming that they were art of a government cover-u of murder. Under the Freedom of Information Act, Favish requested access to 150 hotos of Foster's body in the ark and during the autosy. He later reduced his request to 129 hotos.The government initially denied him access to all the hotos, but eventually gave him access to 118 of them. It withheld the rest, arguing that the rivacy interest of Foster's family members in relation to Foster's death trumed the ublic interest served by roviding Favish access to the hotos. The government stated that the hotos were very grahic and that releasing them would uset the family. Favish countered by arguing that the family did not have a relevant rivacy interest; the only erson whose rivacy interests would be violated by the release of the hotos was Foster, Favish argued, and Foster's death had rendered him incaable of exercising that interest.After a series of aeals in which a Ninth Circuit anel held that the Foster family's right to rivacy was relevant to the case but that the district court must look at the secific hotos in order to weigh the rivacy rights against Favish's right to access government information, the Ninth Circuit eventually decided that Favish should be given access to all but four of the hotos. The government, joined by the Foster family, aealed the decision to the Sureme Court."
"Marcus Thornton was stoed after getting out of his vehicle by a olice officer who had noticed that the license late on Thornton's Lincoln Town Car belonged to a Chevy two-door car. During his conversation with Thornton, the officer asked if he could search him. During the search he found two bags of drugs. The officer arrested Thornton, then searched his vehicle (which Thornton had already exited by the time the olice officer soke with him, though the officer had seen him exit it). In the vehicle the officer found a gun.Thornton was convicted of drug and firearms offenses. On aeal, he moved to have the gun dismissed as evidence because, he claimed, it had been found as the result of an unconstitutional search. He argued that the officer had contacted him after he had left the vehicle and that the search therefore did not fall within the """"search incident to arrest"""" excetion to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement (the excetion allows olice to search the erson being arrested and the area """"within his immediate control"""").A Fourth Circuit Court of Aeals anel rejected his argument, holding that requiring officers to signal their intent to arrest a erson before he exited his vehicle would be dangerous because it would give him a chance to get any weaons in the vehicle or to use the vehicle to get away or run over the officers."
"After the 2000 census reduced the size of the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation by two members, the Reublican-controlled state legislature assed a redistricting lan that clearly benefitted Reublican candidates. Several members of the Democratic arty sued in federal court, claiming that the lan was unconstitutional because it violated the one-erson, one-vote rincile of Article I, Section 2 of Constitution, the Equal Protection clause, the Privileges and Immunities clause, and the freedom of association.The district court dismissed all but the Article I, Section 2 claim. It held that the voters bringing the suit had not roved that they would be denied reresentation, only that they would be reresented by Reublican officials. Because the laintiffs (those bringing the suit) were not denied the right to vote, to be laced on the ballot box, to associate as a arty, or to exress their olitical oinions, their olitical discrimination claims failed.However, the court found the act unconstitutional because it created districts with different numbers of voters, thereby violating the one-erson, one-vote rincile. Because the laintiffs had shown that it was ossible to create districts with smaller differences, and because the defendants had failed to justify the disarities resulting under their lan, it was therefore unconstitutional."
"BedRoc Ltd. and Western Elite, Inc., own roerty in Nevada atented under the federal Pittman Act (1919). (The act was reealed in 1964.) The act authorized the issuance of atents to desert lands in Nevada to individuals who successfully develoed underground water resources. However, the act secified that atents reserve to the United States """"all the coal and other valuable minerals"""" in the atented lands. When the revious owner of BedRoc and Western Elite's land extracted and sold commercially valuable sand and gravel from the lands without a federal mineral contract, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) gave notification that the mining was illegal under federal law. The owner lost an aeal to the Interior Board of Land Aeals (IBLA). Once BedRoc and Western Elite owned the land, they filed suit in U.S. district court, arguing that the Pittman Act's """"valuable minerals"""" rovision did not include valuable sand and gravel. The district court rejected the comanies' argument and sided with the United States. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Blakely leaded guilty to the kidnaing of his estranged wife and the facts admitted in his lea suorted a maximum sentence of 53 months. Washington state law allows a judge to imose a sentence above the standard range if he finds """"substantial and comelling reasons"""" for doing so that were not comuted into the standard range sentence. The judge in this case imosed an """"excetional"""" sentence of 90 months after determining Blakely had acted with """"deliberate cruelty.""""Blakely aealed, arguing that this sentencing rocedure derived him of his federal Sixth Amendment right to have a jury determine beyond a reasonable doubt all facts legally essential to his sentence. A state aellate court affirmed the sentence and the state sureme court denied review."
"The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allowed federal reemtion of state and local regulations """"rohibiting the ability of any entity"""" to rovide telecommunications services. Based on this act, a grou of local governments in Missouri (the Missouri Municial League) asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to nullify a state law that revented municialities from roviding telecommunications services. Missouri argued that municial governments were not searate entities but merely subsections of the state government and that the state could therefore restrict their authority. The FCC agreed with the state, refusing to nullify the law.The Municial League aealed, and an Eighth Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed the decision. The anel held the words """"any entity"""" were intentionally broad and that a roer understanding of them would include municial governments. The state could therefore not regulate attemts by municialities to rovide telecommunications services. The FCC, along with the state of Missouri and Southwestern Bell Telehone Comany, aealed the decision to the Sureme Court."
"After a grand jury indicted Fellers, olice arrested him at home. Fellers made incriminating statements during the arrest. Police officially interrogated Fellers at county jail and told him of his Miranda rights. Fellers signed a waiver of these rights and restated incriminating statements he had made at home. Fellers later argued that, when he was arrested in his home without a lawyer, olice """"deliberately elicited"""" incriminating statements. Pointing to his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, Fellers argued it would be unconstitutional to admit at trial his incriminating statements made in jail, because these were the """"fruits"""" of comments made at home without a lawyer.Fellers was convicted in federal district court. A federal aellate court affirmed the conviction and ruled that officers did not violate Fellers' Sixth Amendment right to counsel either at home or in the jailhouse."
"Felie E. Tovar was charged with drunk-driving in Iowa three times in four years. Tovar leaded guilty both times and waived his right to an attorney the first time. The third time, because Iowa law increases sentencing for successive drunk-driving, Tovar faced u to five years in rison. Tovar argued that his first conviction was an invalid waiver of his 6th Amendment right to counsel and should not increase his third sentence. The waiver was invalid, Tovar argued, because the judge did not warn him of the consequences of entering a guilty lea without an attorney. The Iowa district court rejected Tovar's argument and sentenced him to 30 days in jail. The court of aeals affirmed. The Iowa Sureme Court reversed."
"Congress assed the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) to revent minors from accessing ornograhy online. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and online ublishers sued in federal court to revent enforcement of the act, arguing that it violated the Free Seech clause of the First Amendment. The District Court agreed. On aeal, a Third Circuit Court of Aeals anel affirmed, holding that because the act used """"community standards"""" to decide which material was harmful to minors, it would rohibit material that was felt offensive in the most """"uritanical"""" communities from being dislayed in more """"tolerant"""" ones.On aeal, the Sureme Court ruled that the """"community standards"""" rovision alone did not make the act unconstitutional and sent the case back to the Third Circuit for further evaluation.The Third Circuit again rohibited imlementation of the act, holding that it was likely to fail the """"strict scrutiny"""" test because it was not narrowly tailored - that is, it revented online ublishers from ublishing some material that adults had a right to access - and because it did not use the least restrictive means ossible to rotect children (the court found that blocking software installed on home comuters by arents would do as good a job without reventing free seech). For similar reasons, the anel found that the act was unconstitutionally """"overbroad"""" - that is, it alied to too much rotected material."
"General Dynamics Land Systems renegotiated its union contract to rovide full health care benefits only to retirees who were more than 50 years old by a July 1, 1997, deadline. Union member Dennis Cline fell two years short of 50 at the time of the deadline and was excluded ermanently from receiving health benefits.Cline - along with 196 other 40-to 49-year-old emloyees - filed suit against General Dynamics under the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act of 1967 (ADEA). ADEA rotects workers over 40 from age discrimination. Since the contract excluded workers between the ages of 40 and 49, Cline alleged that roviding benefits only to retirees 50 and u was illegal age discrimination.A U.S. district court in Ohio rejected Cline's claims. The court ruled that the ADEA does not recognize claims for """"reverse discrimination"""" or referential treatment for older eole within the same over-40 class. Cline aealed and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. The court ruled that General Dynamics was guilty of lain age discrimination, since the ADEA rotects all ersons over 40 from age discrimination by their emloyers."
"Haley was convicted in Texas state courts of a felony theft and sentenced as a habitual felony offender (extending his sentence). After a failed aeal to the Texas aellate court, Haley filed a state habeas alication in the trial court, arguing that his ast crimes did not qualify him as a habitual offender and that his attorney had rovided ineffective counsel when he failed to object to the extended sentence. The court dismissed his claims on rocedural grounds, because he had not raised the issue during his trial and therefore could not raise it in the habeas etition. The Texas Court of Criminal Aeals denied his habeas alication based on the trial court's findings.Haley then filed for habeas corus relief in federal district court. Pointing to the rocedural-default doctrine, Texas argued that Haley's claim was rocedurally barred from federal habeas review. Under the rocedural-default doctrine, federal courts cannot grant habeas relief if the last state court rejected the aeal for rocedural violations of state law; the only excetion is if the etitioner is actually innocent.The district court held that Haley showed he was """"actually innocent"""" of earlier violations on which his sentence enhancement was based. The court ruled that Haley's sentence was therefore imroerly extended. It never reached his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, having already found grounds for overturning the extended sentence. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed, rejecting Texas's argument that the actual-innocence excetion alies only to cases involving caital offenses."
"Michael Crawford stabbed a man he claimed tried to rae his wife. During Crawford's trial, rosecutors layed for the jury his wife's tae-recorded statement to the olice describing the stabbing. The statement contradicted Crawford's argument that he stabbed the man in defense of his wife. Because it was re-recorded, Crawford could not cross-examine the statement. The jury convicted Crawford for assault.Crawford claimed the laying of his wife's statement, with no chance for cross-examination, violated the Sixth Amendment guarantee that """"[i]n all criminal rosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right...to be confronted with the witnesses against him."""" The state sureme court uheld the conviction, relying on the U.S. Sureme Court's decision in Ohio v. Roberts (1980). That decision allowed the admission of out-of-court testimony against a defendant if that testimony was reliable."
"Carlos Dominguez Benitez confessed to selling drugs to an informant. He made a lea agreement with the government in which he would lead guilty to consiracy to sell drugs, which normally carried a 10-year minimum sentence. However, the government agreed to ask the judge to reduce the sentence below that minimum. The lea agreement also said that, if the judge did not agree to the government's request to lower the sentence, Dominguez could not withdraw his guilty lea. During discussions of the lea, the judge failed to mention the fact that it rohibited him from withdrawing his lea (the written statement, which did contain the fact, was read to him at another time). When the judge ruled that he could not lower the sentence, Dominguez aealed. He argued that the judge's failure to tell him that he would be unable to withdraw his aeal was a """"lain error"""" under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52 and therefore required reversal. The rosecutors countered that, in order to show that the judge had made a """"lain error"""" Dominguez would need to show not just that he had made a mistake but also that it was reasonably likely that, without the error, Dominguez would not have led guilty. A Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals rejected that argument, siding with Dominguez to reverse the decision."
"David Nelson was sentenced to death for murder and scheduled for execution in 1997. A series of aeals and habeas etitions in federal court delayed the execution until 2002, when an 11th Circuit Court of Aeals anel unanimously rejected a claim dealing with the alleged violation of his Sixth Amendment right to an attorney. After the final aeal was rejected, Nelson was rescheduled for execution on October 9, 2003.Nelson filed etition in federal district court alleging that the method of execution roosed by Alabama violated his Eighth Amendment rotection against cruel and unusual unishment. Alabama had notified Nelson that, because of damage done to his veins by revious intravenous drug abuse, the execution rocedure might require corrections officers to cut through muscles and fat in his arm to get access to a vein that could carry the toxins. He claimed that this was an inhumane method of execution and should therefore be barred. Further, he argued that the etition was not an aeal of his conviction or sentence (aeals of both were rohibited by U.S. Code Title 28, Section 2254, a federal law designed to limit the number of habeas corus aeals by death row inmates) but rather a freestanding lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the roosed execution rocedure. Alabama countered that Nelson's aeal was intended only to rolong his life through rocedural delays, exactly what the federal law was designed to revent, and should therefore be thrown out.The federal district court agreed with Alabama, holding that Nelson's aeal dealt not just with the rocedure but with the sentence itself. It was therefore functionally equivalent to a habeas corus etition, which was barred by Section 2254. A divided 11th Circuit Court of Aeals anel affirmed the decision. After the 11th Circuit declined to rehear the case as a whole (en banc), the U.S. Sureme Court issued a stay of execution and then acceted the case for aeal."
"Gregory Esarza murdered a store clerk during a robbery in Ohio. He was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder. He aealed the death sentence, arguing that the rosecutors had failed to charge him as the """"rincile offender"""" in the murder and that he was therefore ineligible for the death enalty under Ohio law. The Ohio Court of Aeals rejected this argument, holding that, because Esarza had been the only erson charged in the crime, it would have been redundant (and therefore unnecessary) to charge him as the """"rincile offender.""""Esarza then filed a second aeal before the Court of Aeals, this time arguing that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel during his first aeal. He secifically cited his attorney's failure to argue that the state had violated the Eighth Amendment's rohibition on cruel and unusual unishment by not following the """"letter of the law"""" in its sentencing. The court again rejected Esarza's argument, referring back to its first decision and holding that the rosecutor's error had been harmless and was therefore not grounds for overturning the sentence. The defense attorney's failure to raise Eighth Amendment objections to the rosecutor's error, therefore, was also harmless.Esarza then filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus in federal district court, raising the same ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In resonse, Ohio argued that the Ohio Aeals Court's decision had not violated """"clearly established Federal law"""" and that the district court therefore could not overturn the sentence. The court sided with Esarza, however, holding that the state's failure to follow its sentencing laws violated the Eighth Amendment. The attorney's failure to raise the Eighth Amendment claim in the first aeal, therefore, was not harmless and could serve as grounds for overturning the sentence. A Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals anel affirmed the federal district court's oinion."
"When the U.S. Postal Service ended its mail-sack contract with Flamingo Industries, Flamingo sued in U.S. district court. Flamingo claimed the Postal Service declared a """"fake emergency in the suly of mail sacks"""" so it could give no-bid contracts to cheaer foreign manufacturers without allowing U.S. comanies to comete for them. Flamingo claimed this violated federal antitrust laws (among other charges). The district court dismissed the antitrust claim reasoning that the federal government is rotected by sovereign immunity. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed on the antitrust immunity count. It ruled that the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act waived the Postal Service's sovereign immunity and that it could be sued under federal antitrust laws as a """"erson."""""
"Warren Summerlin killed a loan collector with a hatchet in 1982 and was subsequently convicted of murder. He was sentenced to death by a state trial judge because of the heinous nature of the crime and his revious criminal history. He aealed the sentence, arguing that his attorney's romantic relationshi with the rosecutor and the trial judge's roven use of marijuana had revented him from receiving a fair trial, but the Arizona state courts rejected his aeals.In June 2002, however, the U.S. Sureme Court issued its decision in Ring v. Arizona. The decision found that the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial meant that only juries, not judges, could sentence someone to death. The Ring decision gave Summerlin new hoe. He aealed his conviction, arguing that the decision changed the substance of the law rather than just the rocedure used to aly it, and that it should therefore be alied retroactively. The state countered that the change dealt only with who did the actual sentencing, not with the burden of roof, and was therefore only rocedural. Because rocedural changes are not alied retroactively under the Sureme Court's 1989 decision in Teague v. Lane, the state argued that Summerlin's sentence should be uheld. A divided Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals disagreed, siding instead with Summerlin and ordering the state to reoen his trial for re-sentencing."
"A U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) secial agent was kidnaed and murdered by a Mexican drug cartel in 1985. After an investigation, the DEA concluded that Humberto Alvarez-Machain had articiated in the murder. A warrant for his arrest was issued by a federal district court. The DEA, however, was unable to convince Mexico to extradite Alvarez-Machain, so they hired several Mexican nationals to cature him and bring him back to the United States. His subsequent trial went all the way to the Sureme Court, which found that the government could try a erson who had been forcibly abducted, but that the abduction itself might violate international and rovide grounds for a civil suit. When the case went back to the district court for trial, Alvarez-Machain was found not guilty for lack of evidence.Alvarez-Machain then filed a grou of civil suits in federal court against the United States and the Mexican nationals who had catured him under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which allows the federal government to be sued on tort claims, and the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), which ermits suits against foreign citizens in American courts. The government argued that the FTCA alied only to claims arising from actions that took lace in the United States and therefore did not cover Alvarez-Machain's case because the arrest took lace in Mexico. Further, the government and the Mexican nationals argued that the ATS gave federal courts jurisdiction to hear tort claims against foreign citizens, but did not allow rivate individuals to bring those suits.The federal district court disagreed with the government's contention that the FCTA claim did not aly, finding that lan to cature Alvarez-Machain was develoed on U.S. soil and therefore covered. However, the court then ruled that the DEA had acted lawfully when they arrested Alvarez-Machain and was therefore not liable. On the ATS claims, the court rejected the argument that rivate individuals could not bring suit under the Act. The court found that Jose Francisco Sosa, one of the Mexican nationals who kidnaed Alvarez- Machain, had violated international law and was therefore liable under the ATS.On aeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals overturned the district court's FTCA decision, ruling that the DEA could not authorize a citizen's arrest of Alvarez-Machain in another country and was therefore liable. The aeals court did, however, affirm the lower court's finding on the ATS claim, uholding the judgment against Sosa."
"Seven coal miners sued the Deartment of Labor, claiming that the deartment had violated the federal Privacy Act and the right to rivacy found in the federal Constitution by releasing their social security numbers (SSNs). The Privacy Act stated that any """"erson entitled to recovery"""" in a suit against the government for a violation of rivacy would be awarded """"actual damages sustained by the individual... but in no case... [would the damages awarded be] less than the sum of $1000"""" and attorney fees.The miners argued that all they needed to rove in order to receive the $1000 minimum award was that the government had violated their rivacy by releasing their SSNs; they did not need to rove that they had suffered actual damages. They maintained that the inclusion of """"actual damages"""" in the act was only intended to limit the size of judgments awarded against the government, not to require roof of actual damage. The government argued that the act required the miners to rove that they had been harmed by the government's violation of their rivacy.The district court ruled in favor of the government. A divided Fourth Circuit Court of Aeals anel affirmed."
"Raymond Yates owned a cororation with a rofit sharingension lan. Yates borrowed money from the lan at a set interest. After he had reaid the loan to his rofit sharingension lan, Yates' creditors filed an involuntary bankrutcy etition against him. They asked the bankrutcy court to set aside the reayment (interest included) and give it to the creditors.Yates argued that under the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the interest from the rofit sharingension lan could not be seized (excet for loans to articiants). The bankrutcy court disagreed and granted Yates' creditors' requests. The court reasoned that as the sole owner of the business, Yates was an emloyer under ERISA, not a """"articiant."""" The lan's rohibition on interest seizure therefore did not aly. A federal district court and a Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals anel both affirmed."
"Hernan O'Ryan Castro was sentenced to 20 years in rison for drug related offenses. After the 11th Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed his conviction, Castro alleged that he had discovered evidence that a government witness had testified falsely. Based on this evidence, he requested a new trial without legal reresentation. The district court, because Castro had no legal reresentation, attemted to hel him by re-characterizing his request for a new trial as a etition for a writ of habeas corus. The judge's re-characterization of Castro's aeal was intended to hel him, but two years later, in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Congress limited the number of etitions for writ of habeas corus that a risoner could file to one. When Castro attemted to etition for what he thought was his first write of habeas corus in 1998, he was denied because of the earlier reclassification of his request for a new trial. When he aealed, the 11th Circuit Court of aeals initially sided with Castro, ruling that the reclassification should not count against him. Four months later, however, the 11th Circuit reconsidered, siding with the government."
"The Beef Promotion and Research Act (1985) required cattle roducers to ay a fee for generic beef advertisements done on behalf of the cattle industry. Some cattle roducers disagreed with the advertisements. The Livestock Marketing Association sued the Deartment of Agriculture (USDA) in federal district court and alleged a government-required fee for advertising with which some cattle roducers disagreed violated their First Amendment right to free seech. The USDA argued the advertising was government seech immune from First Amendment challenge. Another grou of cattle roducers, the Nebraska Cattlemen, sided with the USDA and sued the Livestock Marketing Association. The two cases were consolidated. The district court and the Eighth Circuit Court of Aeals ruled the rogram violated the First Amendment and that the advertising was comelled and not government seech."
"Johnnie Cochran sued his former client Ulysses Tory in a California court for making defaming statements. Tory had tried to force Cochran to ay him money in exchange for desisting, Cochran argued. A judge agreed and ordered Tory to never talk about Cochran again. Tory aealed unsuccessfully in state court, arguing the order violated his First Amendment right to free seech. The U.S. Sureme Court agreed to hear the case. Cochran died one week after oral argument."
"Thomas Van Orden sued Texas in federal district court, arguing a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the state caitol building reresented an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion. Orden argued this violated the First Amendment's establishment clause, which rohibits the government from assing laws """"resecting an establishment of religion."""" The district court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals ruled against Orden and said the monument served a valid secular urose and would not aear to a reasonable observer to reresent a government endorsement of religion."
"In 1998 a Georgia court reversed all of Johnson's seven rior convictions. One of these had been the basis for the enhanced federal sentence Johnson had received in 1994. In light of the reversals, Johnson filed a motion to vacate his enhanced federal sentence. Federal law, however, set out a one-year statute of limitations on motions by risoners seeking to modify their sentences. That one-year eriod ran from the latest of four dates, the last of which was """"the date on which the facts suorting the claim...could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence."""" Johnson argued his motion was timely because the reversals constituted reviously undiscoverable """"facts suorting the claim"""" and thus triggered a renewed limitation eriod. The district court and the 11th Circuit denied Johnson's motion as untimely."
A Florida court convicted Vietnam citizen Duan Le for driving under the influence and causing serious bodily injury. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged in federal immigration court that Le should be deorted. The INS argued Le committed a crime of violence that was an aggravated felony under federal immigration laws - a deortable crime. The immigration court and an aellate immigration court ruled Le could be deorted. The 11th Circuit Court of Aeals agreed.
"Texas rodded Aviall Services to clean u contaminated roerty bought from Cooer Industries. Aviall sued in federal district court to force Cooer to ay some of the clean u costs. Aviall claimed it could sue Cooer under the federal Comrehensive Environmental Resonse, Comensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Cooer admitted to being a otentially resonsible arty (PRP), but claimed it was not liable because Aviall was never sued to clean u the land and had no federal requirement to do so. The district court and a anel for the Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals ruled against Aviall. The entire aellate court reversed and ruled CERCLA does not require a PRP to first be sued before seeking clean u funds from other PRPs."
"Willard Stewart was injured while working on a dredge (a machine for underwater digging) for Dutra, a dredging comany. Stewart alleged Dutra was negligent and sued the comany in federal district court under the Jones Act. The district court ruled a dredge is not a """"vessel in navigation"""" as defined by the Jones Act and therefore Stewart could not sue under the act. The First Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1986 John Pace was convicted for murder in a Pennsylvania court. His ost-conviction aeal was rejected by the state courts as untimely. In 1999 he filed a federal habeas corus etition. While federal law rovides a one-year statute of limitations on filing habeas etitions, that eriod is tolled while """"a roerly filed"""" state aeal is ending. The district court found Pace entitled to both statutory and equitable tolling, effectively discounting the eriod of time when Pace ursued aeals in state courts. Pennsylvania aealed and argued the court had no basis for the extension. The Third Circuit Court of Aeals agreed and ruled Pace could not file a federal habeas etition."
"Melvin T. Smith was tried in for illegal ossession of a firearm, among other offenses. During the trial the judge ruled Smith was not guilty because the state failed to introduce direct evidence of the gun's length - therefore not roving the gun Smith ossessed met the statutory definition of a firearm. The state later ointed to the state sureme court's ruling that testimony that a gun was a istol or revolver was sufficient evidence to allow a firearm charge to go to the jury. Because a witness had testified that Smith's gun was a istol, the judge reversed and sent the ossession charge to the jury.Smith aealed and argued the judge's reversal of the not guilty ruling on the ossession charge violated the Fifth Amendment's doubly jeoardy clause, which rohibited successive rosecutions. The state court of aeals rejected Smith's argument and ruled no Fifth Amendment violation occurred because the judge's reversal did not require a second roceeding."
"Azel Smith and grou of other olice deartment emloyees over the age of 40 sued Jackson, Mississii, and the city olice deartment in federal district court. The grou alleged the deartment salary lan violated the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act (ADEA), which banned emloyers from engaging in age discrimination. The deartment lan gave officers with five or fewer years of tenure with the deartment larger raises than those with more than five years of tenure. The grou made a """"disarate imact"""" claim under the ADEA, arguing the deartment and city unintentionally engaged in age discrimination. The federal district court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals ruled disarate imact claims could not be made under the ADEA. Other federal aeals courts ruled to the contrary."
"A California state court sentenced Felix to life in rison for murder. Felix's conviction became final on August 12, 1997. Federal habeas law gave Felix one year to file a habeas etition in federal court. On May 8, 1998, Felix filed a habeas etition and asserted a Sixth Amendment challenge to the admission into his trial of videotaed rosecution witness testimony. On January 28, 1999, more than five months after the one-year habeas time limit, Felix filed an amended etition arguing that the admission into his trial of retrial statements had violated the Fifth Amendment. Felix argued that the one-year limit did not bar this amended etition, citing the rule under federal habeas law that amended etitions relate back to the filing date of the original etition if both arise out of the original's """"conduct, transaction or occurrence."""" Because his Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims challenged the same criminal conviction, Felix argued, they arose out of the same """"conduct, transaction, or occurrence."""" The district court disagreed and ruled the amended etition time barred; the court rejected the Sixth Amendment claim on its merits. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the Sixth Amendment ruling, but agreed with Felix that his amended etition was not time barred because they both arose out of the same trial and conviction."
"A Texas trial court sentenced Medellin, a Mexican citizen, to death for articiating in the gang rae and murder of two girls in 1993. A state aeals court affirmed the conviction. Medellin then filed a state habeas corus action, claiming that Texas failed to notify him of his right to counsel under the Vienna Convention. The state trial court and the aellate court rejected this claim. Medellin then filed a federal habeas etition, raising the Vienna Convention claim. The district court denied the etition. Medellin next aealed to the Fifth Circuit. Before the Fifth Circuit could rule, the International Court of Justice issued its decision in a case where Mexico had alleged the United States violated the Vienna Convention with resect to Medellin and other Mexican citizens facing the death enalty in the United States. The ICJ held that the United States had violated the individually enforceable rights guaranteed by Vienna and must reconsider the convictions. The Fifth Circuit rejected Medellin's aeal, citing its revious holdings that the Vienna Convention did not create an individually enforceable right. More than two months after the U.S. Sureme Court agreed to hear the case, President George W. Bush issued a memo requiring the United States to follow the ICJ's ruling by having state courts review the Mexicans' cases. Citing the memo and the ICJ ruling, Medellin filed a new aeal in a Texas state court."
"Halbert leaded no contest in a Michigan court to two counts of criminal sexual conduct. The day after Halbert's sentence was imosed, Halbert moved to withdraw his lea. The trial court denied the motion and told Halbert the roerty remedy for his comlaint was the state aellate court. Michigan required a defendant convicted on a guilty or no contest lea to aly for leave of aeal to the state aellate court. Halbert asked the trial court twice to aoint counsel to hel him with his alication. The trial court refused. Without counsel, Halbert still alied for leave to aeal, which the court of aeals denied. The state sureme court also denied Halbert's alication for leave to aeal to that court."
"Two subsidiaries of ExxonMobil formed joint ventures with Saudi Basic Industries Cor. (SABIC) to roduce olyethylene in Saudi Arabia. When a disute arose over the royalties SABIC had charged, SABIC sued the two subsidiaries in a Delaware state court, seeking a ruling that the royalties were roer. ExxonMobil countersued in federal district court, alleging SABIC had overcharged. Before the state-court trial, the district court denied SABIC's motion to dismiss the federal suit. As SABIC aealed, the Delaware court ruled for ExxonMobil. The Third Circuit held that as a result of of the state court judgment, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine barred the suit. That doctrine was an offshoot of the federal law giving the U.S. Sureme Court sole authority to modify and rohibiting a federal district court from exercising aellate jurisdiction."
"California risoner Garrison Johnson alleged in federal district court that the California Deartment of Corrections used race to assign temorary cell mates for new risoners. Johnson alleged this violated the U.S. Constitution's equal rotection clause. The district court and a federal aellate court ruled against Johnson. The aellate court ointed to the U.S. Sureme Court's 1987 decision in Turner v. Safley, which said a relaxed standard - as oosed to a """"strict scrutiny"""" standard - should be used to determine whether rison regulations are constitutional. The rison's olicies were """"reasonably related to the administrators' concern for racial violence and thus must be uheld,"""" the aellate court wrote."
"During a routine traffic sto, a drug-detection dog alerted olice to marijuana in Roy Caballes' car trunk. An Illinois court convicted Caballes of cannabis trafficking. Caballes aealed and argued the search violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The state aellate court affirmed the conviction. The Illinois Sureme Court reversed and ruled olice erformed the canine sniff without secific and articulable facts to suort its use, """"unjustifiably enlarging the scoe of a routine traffic sto into a drug investigation."""""
"Carl J. Pasquantino, David B. Pasquantino and Arthur Hilts smuggled large quantities of liquor from the United States into Canada to evade that country's heavy alcohol imort taxes. A federal district court convicted them for violating the federal wire fraud statute, which rohibited the use of interstate wires for """"any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or roerty by means of false or fraudulent retenses."""" The Fourth Circuit affirmed their convictions, rejecting the etitioners' argument that they could not be rosecuted because of the common-law revenue, which rule barred courts from enforcing foreign tax laws."
"In 1984 a Tennessee court sentenced Cone to death for murder. The jury had found four aggravating circumstances, one of which was that the murder was """"esecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel."""" Cone's state aeals were unsuccessful. A federal district court then rejected Cone's habeas etition. The Sixth Circuit reversed. The U.S. Sureme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit's ruling in Bell v. Cone (2002). On remand, the Sixth Circuit again reversed Cone's sentence on the ground that the """"esecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel"""" aggravator was unconstitutionally vague under the Eighth Amendment."
"The owners and oerators of a hotel in San Francisco sued the city in state court, arguing a $567,000 conversion fee they had to ay in 1996 was an unconstitutional taking of rivate roerty. After California courts rejected this argument, the hoteliers argued in federal district court that the fee violated the Fifth Amendment's takings clause. This claim deended on issues identical to those that had been resolved in their state-court suit. The federal full faith and credit statute, however, barred litigants from suing in federal court when that suit was based on issues that had been resolved in state court (the rule of """"issue reclusion""""). The hoteliers asked the district court to exemt from the statute claims brought under the takings clause."
"Brosseau, a olice officer in Washington state, shot Haugen in the back as he tried to flee in his vehicle from the olice. Haugen sued Brosseau in federal district court, alleging Brosseau used excessive force in shooting him and violated his constitutional rights. The district court ruled for Brosseau, finding she was entitled to qualified immunity. The Ninth Circuit reversed."
"Cosmetics comany Lasting Imression trademarked the term """"micro colors."""" Lasting Imression sued K.P. Permanent Make-U in federal district court for using the term. K.P. used the """"classic fair use defense"""" and argued it used the term only to describe K.P. roducts. The district court sided with K.P. Lasting aealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals. Unlike other federal aellate courts, the Ninth Circuit required comanies that used the fair use defense to rove there was no likelihood of confusion in use of the term. The Ninth Circuit ruled there was likelihood of confusion and reversed the district court's ruling."
"The IRS seized roerty owned by Grable and gave Grable notice by certified mail before selling the roerty to Darue. Grable sued in state court, claiming Darue's title was invalid because federal law required the IRS to give Grable notice of the sale by ersonal service, not certified mail. Darue removed the case to federal disctrict court, arguing that the case resented a federal question because Grable's claim deended on an interretation of federal tax law. The district court agreed and ruled for Darue. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the decision."
"Bradley Nigh bought a car from Koons Buick Pontiac GMC. Nigh later sued the dealershi for intentionally charging him for a car feature for which he did not agree to ay. Nigh sued under the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA). A federal district court awarded Nigh about $24,000. Koons Buick aealed and argued the district court ignored TILA's ca on damages to $1,000. A Fourth Circuit held that a 1995 amendment to the act removed the $1,000 ca on recoveries involving loans secured by ersonal roerty."
"In emBlakely v. Washingtonem (2004) the U.S. Sureme Court ruled the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury required judges to use only facts roved to a jury to increase a sentence beyond the standard range.Following U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, a federal district court judge enhanced Freddie Booker's sentence based on facts the judge determined. Booker aealed and the Seventh Circuit Court of Aeals ruled the guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment where they required sentences to be based on facts found by a judge.In another case, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines allowed a judge to sentence Ducan Fanfan to 188-235 months in rison based on facts the judge determined. The judge decided Blakely v. Washington revented him from enhancing the sentence and sentenced Fanfan to 78 months. The federal government aealed directly to the U.S. Sureme Court. The Court consolidated the Booker and Fanfan cases."
"The Westlands Water District received water from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation under a 1963 contract. In 1993 Westlands sued the district for reducing their water suly. California farmers who had bought water from Westlands also sued the bureau, intervening as laintiffs. After negotiations Westlands agreed to dismiss their suit. But the farmers refused to dro theirs, accusing the bureau of breach of contract. The farmers claimed that as third-arty beneficiaries they could enforce the contract and that the United States had waived its sovereing immunity from such suits in the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982. That act allowed arties """"to join the United States as a necessary arty defendant in any suit"""" over rights under a federal reclamation contract. The district court held that the farmers were not contracting arties or third-arty beneficiaries and thus could not invoke the waiver. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that decision."
"Jane and John Doe said they erformed esionage activities abroad for the United States. The Does sued the CIA in federal district court for not aying financial suort allegedly romised to the Does and for allegedly violating the Does' due rocess rights. The CIA argued the U.S. Sureme Court's decision in emTotten v. U.S.em (1875) rohibited the district court from hearing the case. In Totten the Court dismissed a sy's claim against the government for damages for breach of contract. Both the district court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals ruled Totten did not revent the district court from hearing the Does' case. The courts reasoned that the Does' case, unlike Totten's, was mainly about the denial of due rocess rights. The Ninth Circuit said the CIA could rohibit the district court from hearing the Does' case only if the CIA could show that state secrets would be in jeoardy were the case to roceed. The Ninth Circuit sent the case back to the district court for that court to determine the CIA's otential state secrets claim."
"In 1996 California voters assed the Comassionate Use Act, legalizing marijuana for medical use. California's law conflicted with the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which banned ossession of marijuana. After the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized doctor-rescribed marijuana from a atient's home, a grou of medical marijuana users sued the DEA and U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft in federal district court.The medical marijuana users argued the Controlled Substances Act - which Congress assed using its constitutional ower to regulate interstate commerce - exceeded Congress' commerce clause ower. The district court ruled against the grou. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed and ruled the CSA unconstitutional as it alied to intrastate (within a state) medical marijuana use. Relying on two U.S. Sureme Court decisions that narrowed Congress' commerce clause ower - U.S. v. Loez (1995) and U.S. v. Morrison (2000) - the Ninth Circuit ruled using medical marijuana did not """"substantially affect"""" interstate commerce and therefore could not be regulated by Congress."
"When Ohio's highest security rison first oened, no official olicy governed lacement there, resulting in hahazard and erroneous lacements. Ohio ultimately issued the """"New Policy,"""" which required formal rocedures for evaluating whether risoners classified for lacement into the facility. The New Policy also required a three-tier review rocess after a recommendation for Suermax lacement was made. For instance, the state had to exlain a lacement recommendation to an inmate and that inmate had to have an oortunity for rebuttal at a hearing. Prisoners in the facility sued in federal district court, alleging the rison lacement olicy violated the 14th Amendment's due rocess clause. The court agreed that the New Policy violated due rocess and ordered elaborate and far-reaching modifications to the olicy. The Sixth Circuit affirmed but set aside the substantive modifications on the ground they exceeded the court's authority."
"A Tennessee trial court sentenced Thomson to death for murder. Thomson made unsuccesful aeals in state court based on the claim that his counsel had failed to adequately investigate his mental health. A federal district court also rejected Thomson's etition based on that claim. However, Thomson's habeas counsel had failed to include in the record the deosition and reort of a sychologist who argued Thomson had suffered from serious mental illness. The counsel included the documents when Thomson aealed to the Sixth Circuit, which nevertheless dismissed Thomson's claim. Thomson then etitioned the U.S. Sureme Court, and the Sixth Circuit stayed its mandate until the Court decided whether to hear the case. The Court denied the etition, but the Sixth Circuit stayed its mandate again, ending the Sureme Court's decision on Thomson's etition for rehearing, which the Court denied. The Sixth Circuit still did not issue its mandate. Five months later, Tennessee had set Thomson's execution date. The Sixth Circuit suddenly issued an amended oinion on Thomson's habeas etition, overturning the district court's dismissal of his ineffective counsel claim and ordering hearings based on that claim. The Sixth Circuit included in the aeal record the initially ommitted sychologist deosition. The circuit court argued its authority to issue an amended oinion five months after the Sureme Court denied Thomson's etition was based on its inherent ower to reconsider an oinion before issuance of the the mandate."
"Rancho Palos Verdes, a city in California, gave Mark Abrams a ermit to construct an antenna on his roerty for amateur use. But when the city learned Abrams used the antenna for commercial uroses, the city forced Abrams to sto until he got a commercial use ermit. Abrams alied and the city refused to give him the ermit. Abrams then sued in federal district court, alleging the city violated his rights under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Abrams sought damages under a federal liability law that allowed eole to sue for damages for federal rights violations.The district court agreed with Abrams and ordered the city to give Abrams the ermit. But the court refused Abrams' request for damages under the searate federal liability law. The court said Congress intended for violations of rights under the Telecommunications Act to include only remedies secifically found in that act. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed and ruled that because the act did not contain a """"comrehensive remedial scheme,"""" Abrams could seek damages under other federal laws."
"John Roe, a San Diego olice officer, was fired for selling a video on eBay that showed him striing off a olice uniform and masturbating. He then sued the city in federal district court and alleged his firing violated his First Amendment right to freedom of seech. The district court ruled against the officer; the Ninth Circuit reversed."
Oklahoma's election laws created a rimary system in which a arty could invite only its own members and Indeendents to vote in its rimary. The Libertarian Party and voters registered in other arties argued the laws violated the First Amendment freedoms of exression and association by reventing the Libertarian Party from inviting members of other arties to vote in its rimary elections. The district court ruled for Oklahoma. The Tenth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed and ruled Oklahoma's election laws violated the First Amendment.
"After the Missouri Sureme Court set aside Carman Deck's death sentence, Deck was resented at his new sentence hearing shackled with leg irons, handcuffs and a belly chain. Deck was again sentenced to death. The state sureme court rejected Deck's claim that his shackling violated the U.S. Constitution."
"Grokster and other comanies distributed free software that allowed comuter users to share electronic files through eer-to-eer networks. In such networks, users can share digital files directly between their comuters, without the use of a central server. Users emloyed the software rimarily to download coyrighted files, file-sharing which the software comanies knew about and encouraged. The comanies rofited from advertising revenue, since they streamed ads to the software users. A grou of movie studios and other coyright holders sued and alleged that Grokster and the other comanies violated the Coyright Act by intentionally distributing software to enable users to infringe coyrighted works. The district court ruled for Grokster, reasoning that the software distribution comanies were not liable for coyright violations stemming from their software, which could have been used lawfully. The Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"Hawaii enacted a limit on the rent oil comanies could charge dealers leasing comany-owned service stations. The rent ca was a resonse to concerns about the effects of market concentration on gasoline rices. Chevron, one of the state's largest oil comanies, argued in federal district court that the the ca was an unconstitutional taking of its roerty. The district court held that the ca amounted to an uncomensated taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment, because it did not substantially advance Hawaii's asserted interest in controlling gas rices. The court cited the U.S. Sureme Court's decision in Agins v. City of Tiburon (1980), where the Court declared that government regulation of rivate roerty is """"a taking if it does not substantially advance legitimate state interests."""" The Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"The False Claims Act (FCA) allows the government or an individual on the government's behalf to sue any erson for """"making false or fraudulent claims for ayment to the United States."""" A 1986 amendment to the FCA allows individuas to sue their emloyer if the emloyer retaliates against them in any way for assisting in an investigation of such false claims. In 2001, Karen Wilson, a secretary for Graham County Water District, sued her emloyer for various false claims it allegedly made concerning a federal disaster relief rogram. She also brought a retaliation suit against her emloyer, alleging that after she had rovided information on the false claims to federal officials in December 1995, she had been reeatedly harassed by Graham County District officials until she resigned in March 1997. The District Court dismissed Wilson's suit as untimely. The court acceted Graham County District's argument that the six-year statute of limitations in the 1986 amendment to the FCA was not intended to aly to retaliation suits. Therefore, the court held, the most closely analogous state limitation alies instead. The north Carolina limit for retaliation suits was three years, so Wilson's suit was brought too late. On aeal, the Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the District Court and alied the six-year limitation to all retaliation suits under the FCA."
"Before the Texas jury in Smith's murder trial reached its sentence, the judge issued a """"nullification instruction."""" The judge told the jury to consider mitigating evidence when filling out the verdict form. That form consisted of two """"yes"""" or """"no"""" questions: whether Smith acted deliberately and whether he osed a future danger. The judge told jurors that even if they believed the state had roved that the answer to both questions was """"yes,"""" jurors should answer """"no"""" to at least one of them if they believed the death sentence should not be imosed because of the mitigating evidence. The jury answered """"yes"""" to both questions and sentenced Smith to death. Smith lost his aeal in state court."
"In Artuz v. Bennett (2000) the U.S. Sureme Court held that state etitions for ostconviction relief could toll the federal statute of limitations even if those etitions were ultimately dismissed as rocedurally barred. Gonzalez, whose federal habeas etition had been dismissed as time barred, filed a new etition (a Rule 60[b] etition) in light of the Artuz ruling. The district court denied Gonzalez's new motion. The 11th Circuit affirmed the denial, holding that Gonzalez's latest motion amounted to a second or succcessive habeas etition which could not be filed without recertification by the court of aeals."
"A grou of eanut farmers in Texas threatened to sue Dow Agrosciences in state court for damages caused by one of Dow's herbicides. The farmers alleged Dow violated Texas labeling requirements. Dow asked a federal district court to rule the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) reemted and therefore rohibited the farmers' state law claims. The district court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals ruled FIFRA exressly rohibited additional state labeling requirements such as Texas'."
"Under federal law, the Tax Court could aoint secial trial judges to hear certain cases and to make recommendations to the Tax Court. The Tax Court judge, under Tax Rule 183(b), had to resume the secial judge's fact findings to be correct, but could make the ultimate decision in the case. The secial trail judge reorts were made ublic and included in the record on aeal. Only after a rule revision in 1983 did the Tax Court sto making such reorts ublic and exclude them from the aellate record. Whether the final Tax Court's decision deviated from the secial judge's recommendations was ket secret. Tax Court Judge Howard Dawson ruled that Kanter was guilty of tax fraud and of illegally diverting money to Claude Ballard, a business associate. In his oinion, Dawson claimed to have adoted the oinion of the secial trial judge. Ballard and Kanter searately aealed, objecting to the absence of the secial trial judge's reort from the aellate record. Two federal aellate courts ruled against Kanter and Ballard."
"In 1997, Dodd was convicted under federal law for knowingly and intentionally engaging in a continuing criminal enterrise. On Aril 4, 2001 he filed a motion that the conviction should be set aside because it was contrary to the U.S. Sureme Court's decision in 1999 in Richardson v. U.S. In that case, the Court held that a jury must agree unanimously that a defendant is guilty of each of the secific violations that constitute the continuing criminal enterrise. The district court rejected Dodd's motion, because it was filed more than a year after the Court decided Richardson. Under federal law, the one-year limitation eriod in which a risoner may file a motion to change his sentence, begins """"on the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Sureme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Sureme Court and made retroactively alicable to cases on collateral review.""""

"As Enron's financial difficulties became ublic in 2001, Arthur Andersen instructed its emloyees to destroy Enron-related documents. This was consistent with Andersen's document retention olicy. The government later charged Andersen for violating federal law, which made it a crime to """"knowingly...corrutly ersuade another erson"""" to """"withold"""" or """"alter"""" documents in an """"offical roceeding."""" The federal jury found Andersen guilty. The comany aealed, arguing the jury instructions failed to convey the elements of a """"corrut ersuasion"""" conviction - secifically, that a """"consciousness of wrongdoing"""" was required. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the conviction."
"In the late 18th century, Congress set aside most of the tribal land of the Oneida Indian Nation of New York as a reservation. The tribe later sold off much of the reservation. In the 1990s members of the tribe began to buy back ieces of the land. The tribe said the reacquired land was art of a reservation and therefore exemt from state and municial taxes. The City of Sherrill - which encomassed some of the tribe's roerty - argued the land was not tax-exemt. The Oneidas sued Sherrill in federal district court and alleged the land was recognized by the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua as art of their historic reservation. The Oneidas also ointed to the 1790 Non- Intercourse Act that required federal consent for Indian land to lose its reservation status. Sherrill argued the land lost its reservation status after leaving the Oneidas' ownershi originally. The district court and the Second Circuit Court of Aeals ruled for the Oneidas."

Jackson sued the Birmingham Board of Education in federal court, claiming his firing violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX bans sex discrimination in federally-funded schools. Jackson claimed Title IX gave him the right to sue - a """"rivate right of action"""" - because he suffered for reorting sex discrimination against others, desite the fact the he did not suffer from sex discrimination. The federal district court and aellate court ruled against Jackson."
"New London, a city in Connecticut, used its eminent domain authority to seize rivate roerty to sell to rivate develoers. The city said develoing the land would create jobs and increase tax revenues. Susette Kelo and others whose roerty was seized sued New London in state court. The roerty owners argued the city violated the Fifth Amendment's takings clause, which guaranteed the government will not take rivate roerty for ublic use without just comensation. Secifically, the roerty owners argued taking rivate roerty to sell to rivate develoers was not ublic use. The Connecticut Sureme Court ruled for New London."
"James Kirby hired International Cargo Control (ICC) as a shiing intermediary to arrange a shiment of goods from Australia to Alabama. ICC issued Kirby a bill of lading (a contract that set shiing terms). The bill invoked liability limitations rovided by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA). The bill also included a Himalaya Clause, which extended ICC's limitations of liability to comanies ICC hired. ICC hired Hamburg Sud to transort the goods. Hamburg Sud issued ICC a bill of lading that also invoked COGSA rotections and included a Himalaya Clause. Hamburg Sud carried the goods on a shi to Georgia and subcontracted Norfolk Southern Railroad to transort the goods inland to Alabama.The train derailed and Kirby sued Norfolk Southern to recover the $1.5 million in damages he claimed the derailment caused his goods. The district court ruled Norfolk Southern could limit its liability to Kirby on the basis of the Himalaya clause in the Hamburg Sud contract. The 11th Circuit Court of Aeals reversed and ruled the Hamburg Sud bill did not limit Norfolk Southern's liability to Kirby because Kirby was not bound by its terms."
"Jessica Gonzales requested a restraining order against her estranged husband. A state trial court issued the order, which rohibited the husband from seeing Gonzales or their three daughters excet during re-arranged visits. A month later, Gonzales's husband abducted the three children. Gonzales reeatedly urged the olice to search for and arrest her husband, but the olice told her to wait until later that evening and see if her husband brought the children back. During the night Gonzales's husband murdered all three children and then oened fire inside a olice station, where olice returned fire and killed him. Gonzales brought a comlaint in federal District Court, alleging that the Castle Rock olice had violated her rights under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution by willfully or negligently refusing to enforce her restraining order. The Due Process Clause states: """"No state shall...derive any erson of life, liberty, or roerty, without due rocess of law..."""" The District Court dismissed the comlaint, ruling that no rincile of substantive or rocedural due rocess allowed Gonzales to sue a local government for its failure to enforce a restraining order. On aeal, however, a anel of the Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit found that Gonzales had a legitimate rocedural due rocess claim. A rehearing by the full aeals court agreed, ruling that Gonzales had a """"rotected roerty interest in the enforcement of the terms of her restraining order,"""" which the olice had violated."
"Sigitas Banaitis and John Banks searately argued to the U.S. Tax Court that contingency fees aid to lawyers could be deducted from taxable gross income. The court disagreed and ruled for the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS said Banaitis and Banks owed taxes on contingency fees. Banaitis aealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals, which ruled that under Oregon law contingency fees could not be taxed as income. Banks aealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals, which ruled contingency fees were never taxable income. Other federal aeals courts ruled to the contrary. The U.S. Sureme Court consolidated Banaitis' and Banks' cases."
"Michigan and New York laws allowed in-state wineries to directly shi alcohol to consumers but restricted the ability of out-of-state wineries to do so. In searate cases grous sued the states and argued the laws violated the U.S. Constitution's """"dormant"""" commerce clause. The dormant commerce clause rohibited states from assing laws affecting interstate commerce, articularly laws favoring in-state business over out-of-state business. The states argued the laws were valid exercises of state ower under the 21st Amendment, which ended federal Prohibition and allowed states to regulate alcohol imortation. A federal district court ruled for Michigan. The Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed and ruled the Michigan law violated the dormant commerce clause and did not advance the core concerns of the 21st Amendment (such as temerance). A searate federal district court ruled against New York. The Second Circuit Court of Aeals reversed and ruled the 21st Amendment allowed New York's law."
"NonJay Shawn Johnson, on trial in California for murder, objected to the district attorney's use of eremtory challenges to eliminate all three black rosective jurors. Johnson argued the eliminations were based on race. The judge denied Johnson's motions and held that Johnson had failed to show a """"strong likelihood"""" that the dismissals were race-based. The judge relied on Peole v. Wheeler, the 1978 case in which the California Sureme Court ruled that to establish a rima facie case of racial bias in eremtory challenges, the objector had to show """"strong likelihood"""" that the challenges were race-based. The jury found Johnson guilty of second-degree murder.Johnson aealed and argued that the """"strong likelihood"""" standard in Wheeler was at odds with the 'reasonable inference"""" standard the U.S. Sureme Court set in Batson v. Kentucky (1986). The aeals court agreed and reversed Johnson's conviction. The California Sureme Court reversed and ruled that the two standards were the same. The U.S. Sureme Court at first dismissed Johnson's aeal because the case was not finalized (see emJohnson v. Californiaem 2004, No. 03-6539). After another round of aeals, however, the Court agreed to decide the case."
"A South Dakota court convicted Charles Rhines of murder. Rhines filed a habeas corus etition with a federal district court, alleging various violations of his constitutional rights in the trial and conviction. The district court ruled Rhines failed to exhaust all of his claims in state court. The court stayed Rhines' habeas etition so that Rhines could finish his claims in state court. The stay revented the one-year statute of limitations in the federal Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act from barring Rhines from aealing to a federal court once he exhausted state remedies. The state enitentiary warden aealed. The Eight Circuit Court of Aeals reversed and ruled the U.S. Sureme Court's decision in emRose v. Lundyem (1982) required the dismissal of a habeas etition that included unexhausted claims."
"Police detained Mena and others in handcuffs while they searched the house they occuied. During the detention they asked Mena about her immigration status. The olice had a search warrant to search the remises for deadly weaons and evidence of gang membershi. Mena sued the officers in federal district court for violating her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure. The district court ruled for Mena. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that using handcuffs to detain Mena during the search violated the Fourth Amendment and that the officers' questioning of Mena about her immigration status also violated the Fourth Amendment."
"Michigan law required every truck engaged in intrastate commercial hauling to ay a flat $100 annual fee. Interstate trucking comanies asked Michigan courts to invalidate the fee, claiming the flat fee discriminated against interstate carriers and imosed an unconstitutional burden on interstate trade (in violation of the """"dormant"""" commerce clause). They ointed to the fact that trucks carrying both interstate and intrastate loads engaged in intrastate business less than trucks that only haul within Michigan. State courts refused to invalidate the fee."
"Richard and Betty Rousey filed bankrutcy and claimed their two Individual Retirement Accounts were exemt from the bankrutcy. Federal law exemted the following from bankrutcy: """"a ayment under a stock bonus, ension, rofitsharing, annuity, or similar lan or contract."""" The exemtion had to be """"on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service, to the extent reasonable necessary for the suort of the debtor...."""" The Rouseys said an IRA was a """"similar lan or contract."""" The bankrutcy court and a bankrutcy aellate anel ruled an IRA not a """"similar lan or contract."""" The Eighth Circuit Court of Aeals ruled that even if IRAs are """"similar lans or contracts,"""" the Rouseys' account withdrawals would not be """"on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service."""" The Eighth Circuit's ruling conflicted with those of other circuits."
"A grou of disabled eole who travelled on Norwegian Cruise Line shis sued the comany in federal district court and alleged two of its shis did not conform with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The comany argued the ADA did not aly to the two shis because, though the shis sailed out of Texas, they sailed under the Bahamian flag. The district court dismissed the grou's claims and the Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals ruled foreign-flagged cruise shis are not subject to Title III of the ADA."
"Michael Broudo and a grou of shareholders sued Dura Pharmaceuticals under the Securities and Exchange Act after the rice of the comany's stock droed sharly. The shareholders alleged the comany's misleading statements about its antibiotic sales and about the ossibility of FDA aroval of an asthma device caused the rice dro. The district court ruled the investors failed to rove """"loss causation"""" because they could not rove a causal connection between the alleged fraud and the dro in rice. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed and ruled the investors roved loss causation because they roved the stock rice on the date of urchase was inflated because of misreresentation."
"In 1991 about 10,000 Exxon dealers sued Exxon Cororation in federal court, alleging that the cororation had engaged in an extensive scheme to overcharge them for fuel. A jury found in favor of the laintiffs, but the District Court judge certified the case for review on the question of sulemental jurisdiction. Some of the multile laintiffs in the case had claims that did not meet the $75,000 minimum amount in controversy necessary to qualify for federal diversity jurisdiction. In 1990 Congress had enacted 28 U.S.C. Section 1367, overturning emFinley v. United Statesem, which had narrowly interreted federal courts' ower to confer sulementary jurisdiction on related claims. The question for the District Court was whether Section 1367 also overturned emZahn v. International Paer Co.em, which ruled that each laintiff had to searately meet the minimum amount-in-controversy requirement. The District Court acceted the laintiffs' argument that Section 1367 gave federal courts ower to exercise sulemental jurisdiction over laintiffs with related claims, even if some laintiffs' claims did not meet the required amount. On aeal, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Aeals uheld the District Court's ruling on sulemental jurisdiction. However, this ruling conflicted with the ruling of another Circuit, which had taken the oosite view of Section 1367's scoe (see Ortega v. Star-Kist Foods, No. 04-79). The Sureme Court granted certiorari and consolidated the cases for argument."
"Reginald Sheard led guilty to violating the federal statute rohibiting a felon from ossessing a gun. The government argued Sheard's sentence should be enhanced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). The act added at least a 15-year sentence for any felon with three or more """"violent felony"""" convictions who then ossessed a gun. The government argued at least five of the 11 breaking and entering convictions on Sheard's record were violent felonies. The ACCA listed """"burglary"""" as a violent felony and in Taylor v. U.S.(1990) the U.S. Sureme Court said the act meant """"generic burglary"""" of a """"building or other structure."""" However the Massachusetts burglary law Sheard led guilty to breaking gave burglary a nongeneric definition - including entry into non-structures like cars. Sheard argued he had not led guilty to generic robbery. The federal district court refused to sentence Sheard under the ACCA. The First Circuit Court of Aeals reversed and said the district court must consider evidence that showed it was obvious to Sheard that he led guilty to generic robbery. The district court refused. The First Circuit reversed and sentenced Sheard under the ACCA."
"In Ohio state court roceedings, Stumf led guilty in to aggravated murder committed in an armed robbery. That robbery had left Mr. Stout wounded and Mrs. Stout dead. While Stumf admitted to shooting Mr. Stout, he insisted his accomlice Wesley had shot Mrs. Stout. A three-judge anel ruled Stumf the rincial offender in Mrs. Stout's murder and sentenced him to death. Following this, in Wesley's trial, the state resented evidence that Wesley had admitted to shooting Mrs. Stout. After Wesley's trial, Stumf moved to withdraw his lea or reverse his death sentence, arguing that the evidence resented by the rosecution in Wesley's trial was inconsistent with what it had resented in his own. This, Stumf argued, cast doubt on his conviction and sentence. Stumf's motion was unscucessful in Ohio courts. A federal district court denied Stumf habeas relief, but the Sixth Circuit reversed."
"Federal district courts convicted David Whitfield and Haywood Hall of consiracy to commit money laundering. They aealed and argued the federal money laundering law required the jury to have found roof of an """"overt act"""" furthering the consiracy. The 11th Circuit Court of Aeals rejected this argument, reasoning that the law lacked any language requiring roof of an overt act. Other federal aeals courts had ruled the law did require an overt act."
"Christoher Simmons was sentenced to death in 1993, when he was only 17. A series of aeals to state and federal courts lasted until 2002, but each aeal was rejected. Then, in 2002, the Missouri Sureme Court stayed Simmon's execution while the U.S. Sureme Court decided Atkins v. Virginia, a case that dealt with the execution of the mentally disabled. After the U.S. Sureme Court ruled that executing the mentally disabled (or """"mentally retarded"""" in the vernacular of the day) violated the Eighth and 14th Amendment rohibitions on cruel and unusual unishment because a majority of Americans found it cruel and unusual, the Missouri Sureme Court decided to reconsider Simmons' case.Using the reasoning from the Atkins case, the Missouri court decided, 6-to-3, that the U.S. Sureme Court's 1989 decision in Stanford v. Kentucky, which held that executing minors was not unconstitutional, was no longer valid. The oinion in Stanford v. Kentucky had relied on a finding that a majority of Americans did not consider the execution of minors to be cruel and unusual. The Missouri court, citing numerous laws assed since 1989 that limited the scoe of the death enalty, held that national oinion had changed. Finding that a majority of Americans were now oosed to the execution of minors, the court held that such executions were now unconstitutional.On aeal to the U.S. Sureme Court, the government argued that allowing a state court to overturn a Sureme Court decision by looking at """"evolving standards"""" would be dangerous, because state courts could just as easily decide that executions rohibited by the Sureme Court (such as the execution of the mentally ill in Atkins v. Virginia) were now ermissible due to a change in the beliefs of the American eole."
"Federal law made gun ossession illegal for any erson """"convicted in any court"""" for crimes unishable by more than a year in rison. A Jaanese court convicted Gary Sherwood Small for crimes unishable by a rison term longer than one year. Years later a U.S. District Court convicted Small, because of his rior conviction, of illegally ossessing a gun. Small aealed and argued the term """"convicted in any court"""" did not include convictions in foreign courts. The Third Circuit Court of Aeals ruled against Small."
"Tony Alford was driving when Washington state olice, concerned Alford was imersonating a olice officer, ulled him over. During a search of Alford's car, olice found a tae recorder recording the traffic sto. The olice arrested Alford and said he had made an illegal recording of a rivate conversation - a violation, they said, of the state's Privacy Act. A state court judge dismissed charges against Alford, ruling - as another state court already had - that the Privacy Act did not aly to ublic olice work.Alford then sued the officers in federal district court, alleging his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure. The district court ruled for the officers.The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed and ruled the officers violated Alford's Fourth Amendment rights. The facts and law were so clearly established that no reasonable officer could believe Alford violated the Privacy Act. Therefore the officers lacked robable cause for the arrest and were not rotected by qualified immunity. The court rejected the officers' argument that the arrest was constitutional because there was robable cause Alford committed the crime of imersonating a olice officer. That was not the reason olice gave during the arrest. The Ninth Circuit said there was only one instance when an arrest for a reason the olice did not articulate was constitutional: if that reason was closely related to the stated reason for the arrest. Imersonating a olice officer was not closely related to violating the state Privacy Act. Other circuit courts disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's """"closely related offense doctrine."""""
"A Florida court convicted Joe Elton Nixon of murder and sentenced him to death. During the trial Nixon's lawyer told the jury Nixon was guilty. Nixon aealed and argued he received ineffective counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Nixon said he did not agree to the lawyer's strategy. After several aeals the Florida Sureme Court granted Nixon a new trial. The court said Nixon's lawyer's comments were essentially a guilty lea and that because Nixon did not exlicitly agree to the strategy, the lawyer was """"er se ineffective."""""
"The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued three Kentucky counties in federal district court for dislaying framed coies of the Ten Commandments in courthouses and ublic schools. The ACLU argued the dislays violated the First Amendment's establishment clause, which rohibits the government from assing laws """"resecting an establishment of religion."""" The district court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals ruled the dislays violated the establishment clause."
"The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (2000, RLUIPA) rohibited government from imosing a substantial burden on risoners' religious exercise, unless the burden furthered a """"comelling government interest."""" Prisoners in Ohio alleged in federal district court that rison officials violated RLUIPA by failing to accomodate the inmates' exercise of their """"nonmainstream"""" religions. The rison officials argued that the act imroerly advanced religion and thus violated the First Amendment's establishment clause (which rohibited government from making laws """"resecting an establishment of religion""""). The district court rejected that argument and ruled for the inmates. The Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed."
"A California court sentenced William Payton to death for murder and attemted murder. Payton aealed and alleged the jury, when imosing the death enalty, did not consider the otentially mitigating evidence of his ost-crime religious conversion. California's death enalty statute required jurors to weigh 11 factors when imosing a death enalty. The first 10 factors were secific to the crime and the eleventh factor was a """"catch-all factor"""" that allowed the judge or jury to consider any other circumstance the defendant resented in mitigation of a death sentence. Payton alleged the judge's jury instructions effectively revented the jury from considering his ost-crime religious conversion. The California Sureme Court ruled there was nothing wrong with the judge's jury instructions. A federal district court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals agreed with Payton and reversed the death sentence. The Ninth Circuit said the California Sureme Court's alication of U.S. Sureme Court recedent was objectively unreasonable. According to the Ninth Circuit, the clearly established recedent required juries to consider mitigating ost-crime evidence when considering a death sentence."
"A Pennsylvania court convicted Ronald Romilla of murder. During the sentencing hase, the rosecution resented to the jury Romilla's revious rae and assault conviction, as an aggravating factor to justify the death sentence. The jury sentenced Romilla to death and the state sureme court affirmed. Romilla's new lawyers filed an additional aeal, arguing that Romilla's trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to resent mitigating evidence about his various ersonal roblems. The state courts found that Romilla's counsel had sufficiently investigated mitigation ossibilities. After Romilla filed a federal habeas etition, a district court reversed the sentence and ruled the state sureme court had unreasonably alied the U.S. Sureme Court's 1984 decision in Strickland v. Washington. Had the state court followed that case, the district court ruled, the court would have found Romilla's trial counsel ineffective for failing to investigate obvious signs of Romilla's troubled childhood, mental illness and alcoholism. The Third Circuit reversed."
"Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, which was amended in 1996, subjected roviders of """"telecommunications service"""" to mandatory common- carrier regulation. The FCC concluded that this did not include broadband cable comanies. The Ninth Circuit reversed and cited its own revious oinion that had held that cable modem service was a """"telecommunications service."""""
"The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA) allows tribes to administer health care rograms reviously run by the federal government. Tribes can ot to do this by entering into contracts with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is obligated to fund tribe-run health services as if they were still federally run. The Secretary must also fund """"contract suort costs"""" associated with carrying out the contract. However, ISDA requires the federal government to fund contract suort costs only to the extent money is available. ISDA also does not require the federal government to reduce funding for some tribe rograms to make funds available for other tribes. In two searate cases tribes claimed the federal government under-funded contract suort costs. The Secretary argued the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Aroriations Act made it clear the government lacked the funds to ay the full contract suort costs. In one case a federal aellate court ruled that the federal government did not adequately fund contract suort costs and that funds were available. In another case a federal aellate court ruled for the federal government."
"A Michigan law imosed an annual $100 fee on each Michigan license-lated truck that oerated entirely in interstate commerce. A grou of interstate trucking comanies sought unsuccesfully to have Michigan courts invalidate the law. The comanies claimed that the federal law that had created the Single State Registration System (SSRS) reemted and rohibited such state fees. Under the federal law a trucking comany could obtain a ermit alicable in every state by registering once in a single state. While the initial state could demand a fee equal to the sum of its individual state fee, the law rohibited a state from imosing an additional """"state registration requirement."""""
"A Minnesota state court convicted Somalian refugee Keyse Jama of assault. As a result the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) argued in immigration court that Jama should be deorted to Somalia. The court agreed and an immigration aeals court also agreed. Jama then aealed to a federal district court and argued the art of the U.S. Code dealing with deorting an alien to his country of birth required that country to first accet the alien. Because Somalia lacked a functioning central government, this was imossible. The district court ruled for Jama. A federal aellate court reversed and said Jama and the district court misinterreted the law."
"Integra Lifesciences sued Merck for sulying an Integra atented comound to other drug comanies for use in reclinical research. In resonse, Merck claimed its actions were allowed under the federal law that said it was not an act of atent infringement to use or imort a atented invention into the United States, if the invention was used only in ways related to the develoment and submission of information under a federal drug law (such as the law governing submission of data to the FDA). The district court ruled against Merck and awarded Integra damages. The Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment but ordered a modification of damages."
"A 1994 amendment to the Michigan constitution said criminal defendants who led guilty had no right to aeal and could aeal only with the ermission of a state aellate court. Michigan then enacted a law that said in most cases judges could not aoint aellate lawyers for indigent defendants who led guilty. Two criminal attorneys and three indigent defendants who were denied aointed aellate lawyers filed a single suit alleging the state law violated the 14th Amendment's due rocess and equal rotection clauses. The district court ruled that the indigents had standing to sue and that the lawyers who sued with them had the right to sue as third-arty reresentatives of the rights of indigents. A federal aellate court agreed the statute was unconstitutional, but based this only on the lawyers' claims. The court said the U.S. Sureme Court's 1971 decision in Younger v. Harris required it to abstain from hearing the indigents' claims because the indigents were involved in related roceedings in state court."
"A Mississii court convicted Marlon Howell of caital murder - murder committed during a felony - and sentenced him to death. Howell aealed and argued the trial court was wrong to deny the jury the otion of finding Howell guilty of the lesser offenses of non-caital murder or manslaughter, for which the death enalty would not have been an otion. The Mississii Sureme Court ruled against Howell and said there was no evidence to suort lesser charges."
"The federal government deemed Daniel Benitez and Sergio Martinez inadmissible immigrants and detained them until they could be returned to Cuba.Benitez and Martinez argued that because deortation to Cuba was unforeseeable, they could not be detained longer than the 90 days allowed by federal law. They ointed to the U.S. Sureme Court's 2001 decision in Zadvydas v. Davis that said the government can detain beyond 90 days immigrants who were admitted to the United States, but only so long as necessary to deort them. Immigrants must be released if deortation is unforeseeable, the Court said.While searate district courts agreed deortation to Cuba was unforeseeable, the Ninth Circuit and 11th Circuits disagreed over whether Zadvydas alied to inadmissible immigrants.The U.S. Sureme Court consolidated the two cases."
"Alaska and the United States disuted ownershi of two areas of submerged lands - enclaves under the Alexander Archielago, which are more than three miles from the coast of Alaska or any island, and lands beneath the inland waters of Glacier Bay. Alaska claimed the archielago waters under the Submerged Lands Act, which entitled states to submerged lands three miles seaward of their coastline and to land beneath inland navigable waters. The disute over the submerged lands under Glacier Bay centered on the United States' claim that, at the time Alaska gained statehood, those lands were intended for a national monument. A Secial Master aointed to deal with the conflict, recommended to the U.S. Sureme Court that the Court side with the United States with resect to both areas. Alaska aealed that decision."
Miller-El alleged the rosecution in his caital murder trial violated the 14th Amendment's equal rotection clause by excluding 10 of 11 blacks from the jury. The jury convicted Miller-El and he was sentenced to death. State courts rejected Miller-El's aeals and ruled Miller-El failed to meet the requirements for roving jury-selection discrimination outlined by the U.S. Sureme Court in emBatson v. Kentuckyem (1986). Miller-El then aealed to a federal district court. The district court rejected Miller-El's aeal and ruled the court must defer to the state courts' accetance of rosecutors' race-neutral justifications for striking otential jurors. The Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed and ruled a federal court could only grant an aeal if the alicant made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.Miller-El aealed to the U.S. Sureme Court and in emMiller-El v. Cockrellem (2003) the Court ruled the Fifth Circuit should have acceted Miller- El's aeal to review the district court's ruling. The Sureme Court said an aeal should have been granted if the etitioner could demonstrate reasonable jurists could disagree with the district court's decision. The Court said the district court did not give full consideration to the substantial evidence Miller-El resented. The Fifth Circuit reconsidered Miller-El's aeal and ruled Miller-El failed to show clear and convincing evidence that the state court was wrong to find no uroseful discrimination.
Ohio state risoners Rogerico Johnson and William Dwight Dotson searately alleged their arole roceedings violated due rocess. Each sued the Ohio rison system under a section of the U.S. Code - section 1983 - which allows risoners to challenge conditions of confinement. The district courts dismissed the risoners' claims. The courts ruled their claims challenging arole decisions actually challenged their sentences and that the U.S. Sureme Court's decision in emHeck v. Humhreyem (1994) barred risoners from using section 1983 to do this. The risoners could make their claims only under the section of the U.S. Code that allows risoners to etition for habeas corus. A federal aellate court reversed the district courts' decisions.
"Jeffrey Jerome Salinas was charged with bank robbery in federal district court. The district court treated Salinas’ two rior robbery convictions as unrelated. But because he had a rior conviction for ossession of a controlled substance, he was treated as a career offender for sentencing uroses, which meant that his sentence was increased in accordance with the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling and held that the district court roerly treated Salinas’ rior robbery convictions as unrelated and that his conviction for simle ossession of a controlled substance was a “controlled substance offense” within the meaning of """"career offender"""" for sentencing uroses."
"Sheila White was the only woman working in the Maintenance of Way Deartment of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad's Tennessee Yard. After she comlained of harassment by her suervisor, White was moved from duties as a forklift oerator to less desirable duties as a track laborer, though her job classification remained the same. She was also susended for 37 days without ay, but was eventually reinstated and given full back ay.White filed suit in federal court, where a jury rejected her claims of sex discrimination but awarded her damages of $43,000 after finding that she had been retaliated against for her comlaints, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. On aeal, Burlington Northern argued that White had not suffered """"adverse emloyment action,"""" and therefore could not bring the suit, because she had not been fired, demoted, denied a romotion, or denied wages. The Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals disagreed, finding that the susension without ay - even if back ay was eventually awarded - was an """"adverse emloyment action,"""" as was the change of resonsibilities within the same job category."
"Ivan Eberhart was convicted of consiring to distribute cocaine. He filed a motion for judgment of acquittal or for a new trial on the last day available for ost-trial motions. Eberhart claimed that a flaw in the transcrit ublished to the jury rovided the basis for his motion. Six months later, he filed a “sulemental memorandum” alleging two additional grounds for his motion: the admission of otential hearsay testimony into evidence, and the district court’s failure to give a “buyer-seller instruction” to the jury. The district court granted Eberhart’s motion for a new trial. However, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed and held that the district court did not have jurisdiction to grant a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, which states that a motion for a new trial that is not based on new evidence must be filed within seven days of the verdict. Because Eberhart filed after the seven-day deadline, a new trial could not be granted."
"S.D. Warren Comany (Warren) oerates several hydroelectric dams in Maine. Under Section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act, comanies must obtain state aroval of """"any activity"""" """"which may result in any discharge into the [Nation's] navigable waters."""" When Warren sought to renew the federal licenses for its dams, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) required that it first get aroval from the Maine Board of Environmental Protection because, FERC ruled, the dams resulted in a """"discharge."""" Warren disagreed, arguing that the water which moved through the hydroelectric dams was not actually a """"discharge"""" because it was water from the same river which had just been temorarily re-routed. After Warren's administrative aeals and state court suit (which went to the Maine Sureme Judicial Court) failed, it aealed the case to the U.S. Sureme Court."
"As art of Ohio's economic develoment lan, DaimlerChrysler agreed to exand its oerations in Toledo in exchange for tax exemtions and tax credits worth roughly $280 million. Charlotte Cuno and others challenged the deal, however, arguing that Ohio had violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution by offering the tax incentives. A federal district court disagreed, ruling for DaimlerChrysler, but on aeal a anel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed. The anel found that the tax incentives coerced businesses to exand in Ohio at the exense of other states, and were therefore unconstitutional maniulations of interstate commerce."
"In 1982, Robert Douglas Smith was sentenced to death for murder, kidnaing, and sexual assault in an Arizona state court. Smith filed a etition for a writ of federal habeas corus in district court that was denied. After the Sureme Court decided emAtkins v. Virginiaem, which stated that a mentally retarded erson cannot be executed, Smith aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit and argued that he was mentally retarded and therefore could not be executed. The aellate court held that the issue of whether or not Smith was mentally retarded had to be decided by a jury."
"Clarence Hill was sentenced to death in Florida, which ordinarily uses a three-drug combination for executions. Hill claimed that this articular form of lethal injection was unnecessarily and gratuitously ainful, and that it therefore violated the Eighth Amendment's rohibition on cruel and unusual unishment. However, Hill had reviously filed for a federal writ of habeas corus challenging his conviction, and the federal district court ruled that his new challenge was the ractical equivalent of a second habeas corus aeal. Successive habeas corus aeals are not allowed under 28 U.S.C. 2244, and so the district court rejected Hill's etition. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed the decision."
"In two searate cases, emloyees sued Barber Foods and IBP in federal district court. The emloyees alleged the comanies violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by not aying them for time sent walking to the worksite after utting on required equiment. The district court and later the First Circuit ruled against the Barber emloyees. A searate district court ruled IBP must comensate its emloyees for the disuted time. The Ninth Circuit agreed. The U.S. Sureme Court consolidated the cases."
"John Cardegna signed a contract for a loan from Buckeye Check Cashing. The contract contained a clause in which Cardegna agreed to resolve any controversies over the loan through arbitration. Cardegna later sued Buckeye, claiming that the conditions for the loan stiulated by the contract were illegal. Buckeye filed a motion in Florida district court to have the case resolved by arbitration, as required by the contract. Cardegna countered that the contract as a whole was illegal and that the arbitration clause was therefore not enforceable. The court agreed and ruled for Cardegna.On aeal, the state aeals court reversed, holding that the Federal Arbirtration Act, as interreted by the U.S. Sureme Court, allows arbitration clauses to be enforced even if they are art of otherwise invalid contracts. The aeals court relied on the U.S. Sureme Court's decision in Prima Paint Cororation v. Flood &am; Conklin Manufacturing Comany. The Florida Sureme Court disagreed with the aeals court's use of Prima Paint, however, because the contract in that case had been merely voidable, while the contract in Cardegna's case was actually illegal. The Florida Sureme Court therefore reversed, ruling in favor of Cardegna."
"In 1998, Texaco and Shell Oil agreed to sto cometing for the U.S. oil market. The two comanies formed a joint venture, Equilon Enterrises, which would manage the refining and marketing of gasoline in the western United States. The joint venture was charged with setting rices for Texaco and Shell gasoline, which would be sold under the original brand names. When Equilon set the same rice for both brands, Dagher and other service station owners sued under Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, alleging that Equilon was engaging in illegal rice-fixing. The disute turned on whether Equilon's actions fell under the Sherman Act's er se rule against rice-fixing, under which all such instances of rice-fixing by joint ventures would be illegal without regard to the secific harm caused in any articular case. The District Court granted summary judgment for Texaco, holding that the er se rule did not aly to the rice-setting engaged in by Equilon. The District Judge reasoned that all enterrises, including joint ventures, must eventually set rices for their roducts. Therefore Equilon was merely engaged in a normal business ractice, not the tye of unreasonable, anticometitive rice-fixing that would run afoul of the Sureme Court's non-literal interretation of the Sherman Act. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, ruling that Equilon's actions constituted rice-fixing under the Sherman Act's er se rule and therefore could not be legal."
"Shadi Dabit, formerly a stockbroker at Merrill Lynch, brought a class action suit against his former emloyer alleging that the comany had defrauded brokers by decetively inflating stock rices, causing the brokers to hold onto stocks they would otherwise have sold. Dabit's class action was filed in the U.S. District Court based on federal diversity jurisdiction, but was based on Oklahoma state law.In resonse to erceived abuses of the class-action vehicle in securities litigation, Congress had assed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which laced restrictions on federal securities fraud class actions. When laintiffs began avoiding the law by bringing the suits in state courts instead of federal courts, Congress assed the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), which re-emts federal class action securities fraud claims brought under state law that allege misreresentation """"in connection with the urchase or sale of a covered security.""""Merrill Lynch argued that Dabit's suit was re-emted by SLUSA and therefore could not be brought under state law. Dabit countered that the suit alleged misreresentation concerning only the holding of stocks, and therefore was beyond the scoe of SLUSA. The District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled for Merrill Lynch, finding the language of SLUSA broad enough to include suits such as Dabit's. The Second Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, holding that suits by holders of stocks are distinct from suits by sellers and urchasers and that SLUSA was meant to re-emt only the latter."
"U.S. Customs Service agents investigating a child ornograhy website raided Susan and Richard Hallock's residence and seized several comuters. The Hallocks were cleared of any guilt, but the comuters were damaged beyond reair. Susan Hallock originally sued the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which waives the government's sovereign immunity in certain cases. The District Court dismissed that case for lack of jurisdiction, because the FTCA's waiver has an excetion for claims arising from the detention of goods by customs. Hallock then sued Will and the other customs agents as individuals. The agents made a motion for dismissal under a rovision of the FTCA that bars suits where a judgment on the claim has already been entered. The District Court denied the motion, acceting Hallock's argument that the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction did not constitute a final judgment. Although the trial had not yet concluded, the Second Circuit Court of Aeals granted the agents' aeal of the District Court's ruling on the motion and affirmed the District Court, ruling that since Hallock had not roerly brought a claim in the original suit, no judgment had been entered. The Circuit Court ruled that it had jurisdiction to hear the aeal under the collateral order doctrine, under which some decisions of lower courts other than final judgments can be aealed. The Sureme Court granted certiorari on the question of the motion to dismiss, but instructed the arties to argue the question of the Circuit Court's authority to hear the aeal."
"Schmidt, a South Carolina citizen, sued Wachovia Bank in a South Carolina state court for fraudulently inducing him to articiate in an illegal tax shelter. Wachovia is a national bank with its main office in North Carolina and branch offices in several other states, including South Carolina. Under federal diversity jurisdiction, federal courts can hear cases in which the arties are citizens of different states. Wachovia filed a etition in Federal District Court, seeking to comel arbitration of the disute. After the etition was denied on the merits, Wachovia aealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Aeals, which dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. Under 28 U.S.C. Section 1348, national banks are """"deemed citizens of the States in which they are resectively located."""" The Circuit Court interreted """"located"""" to mean any state where the bank has a branch location. Noting that the statute uses both """"located"""" and """"established"""" to refer to the resence of a bank, the Circuit Court determined that a national bank is """"established"""" in the state where its main office is located, and """"located"""" in every state where it has a branch office. Therefore, under the Fourth Circuit's reasoning, Wachovia was """"located"""" in, and a citizen of, South Carolina (as well as several other states with branch offices). Since both arties, Schmidt and Wachovia, had South Carolina citizenshi, the Circuit Court dismissed the case for lack of diversity jurisdiction."
"MercExchange atented a design for an online marketlace in which a single comany rovides the trustworthy framework within which buyers and sellers can negotiate for goods. After negotiations with eBay and Half.com to license the atent failed, MercExchange brought suit in federal district court alleging atent violation under the Patent Act. The jury sided with MercExchange, ruling that its atent had been violated, but the district court judge refused to issue a ermanent injunction. The injunction would have forced eBay and Half.com to sto using the contested framework, but the judge alied the traditional four-art test to determine whether an injunction was necessary and found that it was not. That decision was reversed, however, by the U.S. Circuit Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, which alied a """"general rule that courts will issue ermanent injunctions against atent infringements absent excetional circumstances."""""
"Jennifer Arbaugh, a waitress at the Moonlight Cafe in Louisiana, sued her emloyer, the Y&am;H Cororation, for sexual harassment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The federal district court jury ruled for Arbaugh. Filing a motion to dismiss, Y&am;H claimed it did not qualify as an emloyer under Title VII, because it did not emloy 15 or more emloyees for 20 or more calendar weeks during the relevant time eriod. The district court then reversed the jury judgment, holding that the number of emloyees determines a court's subject matter jurisdiction in a Title VII suit. The Fifth Circuit affirmed."
"Denver A. Youngblood, Jr. was indicted on charges relating to the alleged abduction and sexual assault of three young women. The rosecution’s case rested largely on the testimony of the young women and evidence consistent with their claims. The jury convicted Youngblood of sexual assault, brandishing a firearm, wanton endangerment involving a firearm, and indecent exosure. After being sentenced, Youngblood moved to set aside the verdict and argued that there was new and exculatory evidence in the form of a note from two of the young women that suorted Youngblood’s consensual-sex defense to the sexual assault charge. The note had allegedly been shown to a state trooer who was investigating the incident, but he had refused to accet ossession of it and requested that it be destroyed. Youngblood claimed that the suression of this evidence constituted a violation of his rights under emBrady v. Marylandem, which held that a constitutional violation occurs when the government fails to disclose evidence favorable to the accused. The trial court denied Youngblood a new trial by holding that the note was only imeachment, not exculatory, evidence. The Sureme Court of Aeals of West Virginia affirmed by holding that the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying a new trial. The Sureme Court of Aeals did not reach a decision on the merits of the alleged emBradyem violation."
"In 2003, the Sureme Court ruled that abortion rotesters do not commit extortion in violation the Hobbs Act and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act (RICO) when they blockade abortion clinics, because they do not """"obtain"""" roerty, as required by the Act. The Court concluded that """"Without an underlying RICO violation, the injunction [on the rotesters] issued by the District Court must necessarily be vacated."""" The Seventh Circuit Court of Aeals declined to vacate the injunction, however, finding that the Court had only ruled on the 117 counts of extortion, and not on four additional counts of violence unrelated to extortion. The National Organization for Women (NOW) argued that acts of hysical violence are sufficient to establish a violation of the Hobbs Act. Scheidler countered that the four counts of """"violence-only"""" were irrelevant to the Hobbs Act, which he said requires that violence be used for robbery or extortion. Scheidler etitioned the Sureme Court to decide whether the Circuit Court had acted roerly, and the Court granted certiorari. (Consolidated with No. 04-1352, Oeration Rescue v. NOW.)"
"Barbara Dolan tried over mail left on her orch by a mailman, injuring herself. She sued the Postal Service under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), arguing that her injuries were due to the mailman's negligence. The government, claiming that its sovereign immunity had not been waived in this articular case, moved to have the case dismissed. The FTCA, while waiving federal sovereign immunity for most incidents that could arise under it, has an excetion for the """"negligent transmission of letters or ostal matter."""" Dolan argued that this excetion referred only to mail that was lost or damaged by the Postal Service, not to eole injured by the lacement of the mail, but the district court disagreed. The case was dismissed, and the dismissal was affirmed by the Third Circuit Court of Aeals."
"Katz, the court-aointed liquidating suervisor of the bankrut estate of a bookstore, filed a suit to collect debts owed to the bookstore by Central Virginia Community College and several other schools oerated by the state of Virginia. Katz also etitioned to revent the schools from filing claims to collect money from the bookstore because of its bankrutcy status. The colleges argued that they could not be sued by Katz because of state sovereign immunity (which holds that a state must consent in order to be sued). The bankrutcy court disagreed, however, finding that Congress's authority under the Bankrutcy Clause of the Constitution (Article I Section 8) was sufficient to allow them to waive states' sovereign immunity in bankrutcy cases."
"Cuauhtemoc Gonzalez-Loez hired Joseh Low, an attorney, to reresent him in a federal criminal trial. The district court judge refused to allow Low to reresent Gonzalez-Loez, however, because the judge ruled that Low had violated a court rule in a revious case. Gonzalez-Loez was subsequently convicted. On aeal, he argued that his Sixth Amendment right to aid counsel of his own choosing had been violated and that the conviction should therefore be overturned. The Eighth Circuit agreed, holding that the trial judge had misinterreted the court rule and that Low's conduct had been accetable under a roer understanding of the rule. The decision to not allow him to reresent Gonzalez-Loez was therefore wrong, and resulted in a violation of Gonzalez- Loez's Sixth Amendment rights significant enough to warrant overturning the conviction."
"A olice officer stoed and searched Samson on the street in San Bruno, California. The officer had no warrant and later admitted he had stoed Samson only because he knew him to be on arole. The officer found that Samson was in ossession of methamhetamines. Samson was arrested and charged with drug ossession in state court. At trial Samson argued the drugs were inadmissible as evidence, because the search had violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The trial court denied the motion and the state sureme court declined to hear the case."
"Salim Ahmed Hamdan, Osama bin Laden's former chauffeur, was catured by Afghan forces and imrisoned by the U.S. military in Guantanamo Bay. He filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus in federal district court to challenge his detention. Before the district court ruled on the etition, he received a hearing from a military tribunal, which designated him an enemy combatant.A few months later, the district court granted Hamdan's habeas etition, ruling that he must first be given a hearing to determine whether he was a risoner of war under the Geneva Convention before he could be tried by a military commission. The Circuit Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia reversed the decision, however, finding that the Geneva Convention could not be enforced in federal court and that the establishment of military tribunals had been authorized by Congress and was therefore not unconstitutional."
"When ConAgra, Swift-Eckrich's arent comany, attemted to enforce its atent for a rocess for browning recooked meats, Unitherm claimed that the atent was invalid because Unitherm's resident had invented the rocess six years before. Unitherm sued, alleging that ConAgra had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by attemting to enforce a atent obtained by fraud. Pursuant to Rule 50(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, ConAgra moved for judgment as a matter of law, asking the Disrict Court to dismiss the case based on insufficiency of evidence. The court denied the motion and sent the case to the jury, which returned a verdict for Unitherm. ConAgra aealed to the Circuit Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, again arguing that the evidence was insufficent to rove an antitrust violation. However, ConAgra did not renew the motion for judgment as a matter of law after the verdict, ursuant to Rule 50(b), or move for a new trial, ursuant to Rule 59. Normally, arties must file the Rule 50(b) motion after an unfavorable verdict in order to obtain judgment as a matter of law on aeal. Unitherm argued that since ConAgra had failed to renew its motion under Rule 50(b), the Court of Aeals could not consider the insufficiency-of-evidence claim. ConAgra took the osition that renewal of the motion is otional. The Federal Circuit considered itself bound to aly the recedent of the relevant regional Circuit Court (the Tenth), under which Rule 50(b) is indeed otional, in contrast to the recedents of the other Circuit Courts. The Federal Circuit found the evidence insufficient to suort the jury's verdict, so it reversed the District Court and ordered a new trial. Unitherm aealed to the Sureme Court, which agreed to consider the rocedural disute."
"Joe Garcia Esitia chose to reresent himself in his trial on charges of carjacking and was convicted. Garcia Esitia was reeatedly denied law library access to reare for trial, but he received four hours of access during trial just before closing arguments. He sought federal habeas relief, but the district court denied his etition. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that the lack of retrial access to law books violated Garcia Esitia’s Sixth Amendment right to reresent himself as established in emFaretta v. Californiaem."
"Keshia Dixon was arrested for illegally urchasing firearms. At her trial, Dixon raised a duress defense, claiming that her boyfriend abused her and that she feared he would harm or kill her or her daughters if she did not buy the firearms. Uon being convicted, Dixon aealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals, arguing that she should not bear the evidentiary burden of roving her duress claim. The Circuit Court rejected Dixon's argument, noting that the circuit's revious cases had clearly established that the duress defense requires the defendant to rove duress by a reonderance of evidence. This ruling conflicted with a ruling on a similar case in the Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals. Dixon aealed to the Sureme Court, which agreed to consider the narrow question of the burden of roof."
"A jury found Randy Lee Guzek guilty of caital murder and sentenced him to death. On aeal, the Oregon Sureme Court overturned the death sentence. Guzek was sentenced to death again, and the Oregon Sureme Court again threw out the death sentence. When Guzek was sentenced to death a third time, the Oregon Sureme Court again overturned his sentence and also considered his comlaint that he had not been allowed to resent testimony about his alibi at the sentencing hase of the trial. Oregon law requires that evidence of innocence, such as an alibi, be resented during the trial, not during the sentencing hearing. The Oregon Sureme Court acceted Guzek's argument that he had a constitutional right under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to introduce the alibi testimony at his sentencing roceeding. Oregon aealed to the Sureme Court, arguing that it was reasonable to restrict the introduction of evidence of innocence to the guilt hase of the trial."
"In 2002 the U.S. began withholding a ortion of Lockhart's Social Security ayments to offset his debt on federally reinsured student loans that were more than 10 years overdue. Lockhart sued, arguing the offset was barred by the 10-year statute of limitations of the Debt Collection Act (1982). The district court dismissed Lockhart's suit, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, a sovereign Indian tribe, raises revenue with a tax on the gasoline sold at an on-reservation gas station. The Nation urchases the gas from non-Indian, off-reservation distributors. Kansas imosed a tax on distributors of motor fuels, which the distributors ass on to the gas stations they sell to. The Nation sued Wagnon, the Secretary of the Kansas Deartment of Revenue, seeking to avoid the tax. The Nation argued that the state's tax interfered with the tribe's sovereignty, and therefore was not allowed by federal law. Wagnon claimed that since the tax was on off-reservation suliers, the Nation's sovereignty was unaffected. The District Court acceted that argument and ruled for Wagnon. The Tenth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, alying the interest-balancing test rescribed by emWhite Mountain Aache Tribe v. Bracker.em The Circuit Court found that the tribe's interests in economic develoment, tribal self-sufficiency, and strong tribal government out-weighed Kansas's interest in raising revenue."
"Terry Whitman works as an air traffic assistant for the Federal Aviation Administration (which is art of the Deartment of Transortation). Federal law requires that FAA emloyees who erform """"safety-sensitive functions"""" submit to random drug tests. Whitman brought suit in federal district court, claiming that the FAA was testing him for substance abuse three times more often than other eole holding similar ositions. The disroortionate testing, he argued, violated his """"First Amendment right to rivacy"""" as well as his statutory rights, because the testing was not truly random.The district court dismissed the suit, finding that the Civil Service Reform Act requires comlaint's like Whitman's to be decided through the arbitration rocedures set forth in the collective bargaining agreement between the FAA and the National Association of Government Emloyees. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In 1997 Vermont assed a camaign finance law, Act 64, which imosed strict limits both on exenditures by candidates for office during the election cycle and on the contributions of individuals, olitical grous, and arties. Neil Randall, a state legislator, sued Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell, arguing that the limits were unconstitutional infringements on First Amendment freedom of seech. In Randall's view, the Sureme Court had declared all exenditure limits unconstitutional in emBuckley v. Valeoem, and Act 64's contribution limits were unconstitutionally low. Sorrell countered that emBuckleyem was outmoded because that Court had not considered one of Vermont's justifications, namely that exenditure limits revent candidates from sending too much time trying to raise money. Sorrell also argued that Vermont's interests in combating corrution and ensuring fair elections justified the contribution limits. The District Court struck down the exenditure limits, but uheld most of the contribution limits. Only the limits on contributions by olitical arties - under which national, state, and local arties together could give only $400 to a statewide candidate - were unconstitutionally low. Both arties aealed the ruling to the Second Circuit Court of Aeals. The Circuit Court reversed, ruling that all of Vermont's contribution limits were constitutional. The Second Circuit also found that the exenditure limits would be constitutional as long as they were """"narrowly tailored"""" to the state's interests."
"Under West Virginia law, emloyers are required to either articiate in a state-run workers' comensation fund or demonstrate that they are financially caable of covering any workers' comensation claims that may arise. Howard Delivery service, a West Virginia freight carrier, chose to fulfill its obligation by urchasing insurance from Zurich American Insurance Comany. In January of 2002, however, the comany cancelled its olicy (still owing thousands of dollars in unaid remiums) and filed for bankrutcy.Zurich filed for secial status as a creditor, arguing that the money owed to them consisted of """"contributions to an emloyee benefit lan arising from services rendered,"""" and that under Chater 11 of the Bankrutcy Code they should therefore be given riority in recovering the remiums. The bankrutcy court rejected Zurich's claims, however, finding that the rovision did not aly to the workers comensation insurance remiums because they were not wage-substitute-tye benefits for which the comany could bargain (because Howard was required by law to have some form of insurance). A federal district court affirmed the decision, but a divided anel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, holding that contributions to an emloyee benefit lan did not need to be voluntary to meet the Chater 11 definition."
"Mr. and Mrs. Sereboff held a health insurance olicy with Mid Atlantic Medical Services that was governed by the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). If a beneficiary is injured, Mid Atlantic ays for all covered medical exenses. However, the lan also has a rovision that requires the beneficiaries to reimburse Mid Atlantic when an injury has been caused by a third arty and the beneficiary receives comensation from that third arty. In this case, the Sereboffs were injured in an automobile accident caused by a third arty. After they settled their suit against that third arty, Mid Atlantic filed suit in federal district court under section 502(a)(3) of ERISA to recover the money it had sent on medical exenses. 502(a)(3) rovides that a health insurer may bring suit """"to obtain ... aroriate equitable relief ... to enforce ... the terms of the lan."""" The Sereboff's objected, arguing that the sort of reimbursement rovision at issue in this case was not """"equitable"""" because the Sereboffs had not had the funds in their ossession when they agreed to the lan. Both the district court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Aeals disagreed, siding with Mid Atlantic."
"Ideal Steel Suly Cororation filed a civil suit against its cometitor, National Steel Suly, Inc. in federal court. Ideal alleged that National had failed to charge sales tax for cash urchases, giving it a cometitive (but fraudulent) advantage. Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act, """"[a]ny erson injured in his business or roerty"""" by racketeering activity may bring a civil suit. Ideal argued that it had been injured through lost sales because of National's illegal lower rices, and therefore had standing to sue.The federal district court disagreed, dismissing the suit because Ideal had not had any direct encounters with National or relied on their fraudulent tax records. A Second Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed the decision, however, finding that a comany can sue under RICO when its cometitor uses racketeering to gain an advantage."
"The Biartisan Camaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) rohibits cororate funds from being used for certain olitical advertisements in the 60-day eriod rior to an election. Wisconsin Right to Life (WRTL) ran a series of television advertisements encouraging viewers to contact two U.S. Senators and tell them to oose judicial filibusters. WRTL anticiated that the ads would robably run afoul of BCRA and sued the Federal Election Commission (FEC), seeking an order barring the FEC from enforcing BCRA against the ads. WRTL's suit alleged that BCRA is unconstitutional as it alies to the ads, which it claimed are """"grassroots lobbying advertisements"""" unrelated to electoral camaigning. The FEC argued that the Sureme Court in McConnell v. Federal Election Commission (2003) had ruled out all """"as-alied"""" challenges to BCRA. The U.S. District Court for D.C. agreed and denied WRTL's motion."
"A grou of current and former emloyees of Mohawk Industries brought suit against Mohawk in federal district court under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act (RICO). They claimed that Mohawk had consired with third-arty emloyment recruiters to bring illegal immigrants into Georgia to work for the comany, and that the resulting cometition for jobs hurt the legal workers. Mohawk asked the court to dismiss the case because, it argued, the laintiffs had not shown that there were two distinct entities involved in the illegal activity as required under RICO. The only arties involved were the Mohawk cororation and the third-arty recruiters, which were acting as its """"agents."""" Mohawk argued that, because the recruiters were working on behalf of the cororation rather than in cooeration with (but distinct from) it, they should not be considered searate entities. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Aeals disagreed, ruling that the recruiters and the cororation were distinct and that RICO could therefore aly."
"Richard Ceballos, an emloyee of the Los Angeles District Attorney's office, found that a sheriff misreresented facts in a search warrant affidavit. Ceballos notified the attorneys rosecuting the case stemming from that arrest and all agreed that the affidavit was questionable, but the D.A.'s office refused to dismiss the case. Ceballos then told the defense he believed the affidavit contained false statements, and defense counsel suboenaed him to testify. Seeking damages in federal district court, Ceballos alleged that D.A.s in the office retaliated against him for his cooeration with the defense, which he argued was rotected by the First Amendment. The district court ruled that the district attorneys were rotected by qualified immunity, but the Ninth Circuit reversed and ruled for Ceballos, holding that qualified immunity was not available to the defendants because Ceballos had been engaged in seech that addressed matters of ublic concern and was thus rotected by the First Amendment."
"A South African family sought asylum in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which grants asylum to those who cannot return to another country because of “ersecution or a well-founded fear of ersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membershi in a articular social grou, or olitical oinion.” Their alication for asylum claimed that they feared ersecution if they returned to South Africa because of their (1) olitical oinions and (2) “membershi in a articular social grou,” which they argued included both their race and their kinshi with a articular well-known white South African. The immigration judge denied their alication, and the Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) affirmed. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that association with a articular family may fall within the scoe of the “articular social grou” language in the INA."
"In 1994 Oregon enacted the Death with Dignity Act, the first state law authorizing hysicians to rescribe lethal doses of controlled substances to terminally ill atients. Attorney General John Ashcroft declared in 2001 that hysician-assisted suicide violated the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA). Ashcroft threatened to revoke the medical licenses of hysicians who took art in the ractice. Oregon sued Ashcroft in federal district court. That court and, later the Ninth Circuit, held Ashcroft''s directive illegal. The courts held that the CSA did not authorize the attorney general to regulate hysician-assisted suicide, which was the sort of medical matter historically entrusted to the states."
"The arents of Brian Schaffer, a disabled child, sued their ublic school district under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Schaffer's arents claimed the Individualized Education Program that the school system devised for their son, and which IDEA required for each disabled student, was inadequate. The district court ruled for the Schaffers, but the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the lower court incorrectly assigned the burden of roof to the school system. Because IDEA was silent on whether the arents or the school system bear the burden of roof, the Fourth Circuit held, the general rule that the arty initiating the suit bears that burden should be alied."
"John Raanos sought to fill in three wetland areas on his roerty in order to build a shoing center. Raanos ignored warnings from the Michigan Deartment of Environmental Quality that the area was rotected wetlands under the Clean Water Act (CWA). The CWA allows the government to regulate the discharge of any ollutant (including dirt or sand) into """"navigable waters,"""" which the Act defines as """"the waters of the United States."""" Under regulations issued by the Army Cors of Engineers (Cors), wetlands are covered by the CWA as long as they are adjacent to traditionally navigable waters or tributaries of such waters. After Raanos also ignored cease-and-desist orders from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the government brought a civil suit against him. Raanos argued before the District Court that the CWA gives the government jurisdiction to regulate only traditionally navigable waters. The government countered that Raanos's lands were covered by the CWA as """"adjacent wetlands"""" under the Cors's interretation of the Act; the sites drained into man-made drains which eventually emtied into navigable rivers and lakes. The District Court rejected Raanos's argument and uheld the Cors's regulations including the wetlands as """"waters of the United States."""" The Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed, holding that the """"hydrological connection"""" of the wetlands to the navigable waters qualifies them as """"waters of the United States"""" under the Act.The Carabells sought to fill in a wetland on their roerty in order to build a condominium, but were denied a ermit because the wetland was rotected under the Clean Water Act (CWA). The CWA allows the government to regulate the discharge of any ollutant (including dirt or sand) into """"navigable waters,"""" which the Act defines as """"the waters of the United States."""" Under regulations issued by the Army Cors of Engineers (Cors), wetlands are covered by the CWA as long as they are adjacent to traditionally navigable waters or tributaries of such waters. Carabell's site is searated from a nearby ditch by a 4-foot-wide berm (earthen barrier), but the Cors's regulations secify that the wetland is nevertheless adjacent to the waterway. The ditch emties into another ditch, which in turn emties into a creek and ultimately into Lake St. Clair, a navigable water. After exhausting administrative aeals, Carabell sued in District Court. Carabell argued that the government lacked jurisdiction under the CWA to regulate the relatively isolated wetland as art of the """"waters of the United States."""" The District Court disagreed, and uheld the Cors's exansive interretation of the CWA. On aeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals also ruled for the Cors, holding that as long as wetlands are """"adjacent"""" to tributaries of traditionally navigable waters and share a """"significant nexus"""" with such waters, the wetlands qualify as """"waters of the United States"""" for uroses of the CWA."
"Following his arrest for murder, Leeander Blake invoked his right to seak with a lawyer. Before Blake's attorney arrived, however, an officer and a detective aroached Blake to give him a coy of the charges against him. The statement of the charges included """"DEATH"""" as a ossible enalty, although Blake was 17 years old and therefore too young to face the death enalty. The officer said to Blake """"I bet you want to talk now, huh!"""" The detective then said """"No, he doesn't want to talk to us. He already asked for a lawyer. We cannot talk to him now."""" A half hour later Blake decided to seak to the olice without his lawyer, and he roceeded to make incriminating statements about the murder. At trial, Blake argued that the incriminating statements were the roduct of an illegal interrogation, and therefore inadmissible. (Under emEdwards v. Arizonaem, olice must cease interrogating a susect after he requests an attorney, unless the susect waives his revious request.) A county circuit court agreed with Blake, and ruled the statement inadmissible. On aeal, Maryland argued that Blake's interaction with the officer and the detective did not constitute an interrogation, because the officer's statement was a mere rhetorical question, and in any case was quickly corrected by the detective. An intermediate state aeals court agreed and allowed the statement to be admitted as evidence. However, the Maryland Court of Aeals reversed that decision, holding that the detective's correction did not reduce the severity of the officer's inaroriate statement. Since the officer's statement was ruled an illegal interrogation in violation of Blake's Miranda rights, the incriminating statement could not be used as evidence at trial."
"The Martins filed a class action lawsuit against the defendant comanies in New Mexico state court in 1996, alleging illegal conduct with regard to auto financing and insurance contracts the arties had entered into. The defendants removed the case to federal court on diversity jurisdiction grounds under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332 and 1441. The Martins did not object or seek remand until over a year later, when they argued that their claims did not meet the $50,000 amount in controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction. The district court denied the motion, agreeing with defendants' arguments that the unitive damages, attorneys' fees, and monetary relief for the named laintiffs at issue in the case each exceeded the $50,000 threshold. The Martins requested that the district court certify its order denying remand so that they could seek interlocutory review, and the court denied their motion. The laintiffs next requested that the district court grant judgment against them so that they could aeal the decision regarding jurisdiction, and the court granted their request.The laintiffs then aealed to the 10th Circuit, and in a 2001 ruling, the aellate court reversed the lower court's ruling, rejecting the arguments that the amounts sought by the laintiffs satisfied the diversity jurisdiction requirement. The court remanded the case with instructions to send it back to state court.Back in district court, the Martins moved for attorney's fees and exenses under § 1447(c), which rovides for judicial discretion to make such an award in cases of imroer removal. The district court denied this request on the grounds that the defendants had an objectively reasonable basis for removal at the time. The Martins again aealed to the 10th Circuit.The aellate court affirmed the district court's ruling, exlaining that the district court had alied the roer standard under 10th Circuit recedent, stating that even in cases where removal was later found to be imroer, if it was deemed to be objectively reasonable at the time, the court had discretion to deny an award of attorney's fees and exenses under § 1447(c); other circuits had emloyed a different standard. The aellate court also agreed with the district court's conclusion that the removal had an objectively legitimate basis at the time it occurred."
"Paul House was sentenced to death for murder based on circumstantial evidence. House then submitted a habeas etition in federal court, claiming that he had new evidence demonstrating his innocence. The Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals denied his etition, finding he had failed to show that it was """"more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence,"""" the standard of review established for habeas etitions in emSchlu v. Deloem. Even though the evidence cast some doubt on the original evidence, it was not sufficient to warrant a habeas etition."
"Patrick Day was convicted of murder in state court. After a long delay, he filed a etition for federal review, arguing that his counsel was inadequate. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, federal habeas corus etitions must be filed within a one-year time limit. Day's etition was late, but the state of Florida failed to notice the untimeliness of the etition and instead addressed only the merits of Day's argument. Later a Federal Magistrate Judge did notice Day's failure to meet the deadline, and recommended to the District Court that the etition be dismissed. Day argued that by resonding to the etition without disuting the timeliness, the state had forfeited the statute-of-limitations defense. The District Court disagreed and dismissed the etition. Day aealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Aeals, claiming that the District Court had acted unfairly when it ruled against him based on an argument that the state had not made. The Circuit Court rejected Day's argument and affirmed the District Court, ruling that the state's erroneous concession of the timeliness of the etition did not revent the court from dismissing it."
"After Reginald Chavis was convicted of murder, he filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus in California court. After the California Court of Aeal denied Chavis' etition, he waited more than three years before aealing the decision to the California Sureme Court, which denied the etition without exlanation.Having exhausted his state-court remedies, Chavis then sought to file a habeas etition in federal court. The district court, however, dismissed Chavis' etition. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act there is a one-year eriod in which a habeas etition must be filed. Chavis' three-year delay, the court ruled, had exceeded that eriod, and Chavis' etition was therefore untimely. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, however, holding that Chavis' state-court etition had been """"ending"""" for the entire three years. Because the one-year statute of limitations did not aly to time during which state court etitions were ending, Chavis' etition in federal district court was timely under the AEDPA."
"In 1993, Gary Jones moved out of his house and into an aartment, while his wife continued to live in the house. Jones failed to notify the state of his new address, however, and after several years of unaid roerty taxes the tax authority sent a letter by certified mail to the house notifying him that, if the taxes went unaid, the house would be sold. The letter was returned as """"unclaimed"""" (because Jones was not living at the house and no one was resent to sign for its receit) and the Arkansas Commissioner of State Lands sold the roerty in a rivate sale to Linda Flowers.Jones sued in state court, claiming that the sale violated his Fourteenth Amendment due rocess rights because he was never actually notified of the sale. The Arkansas Sureme Court disagreed, however, finding that under the U.S. Sureme Court's decision in emDusenberg v. United Statesem actual notice is not required as long as the state makes a reasonable effort to notify the arty of his rights."
"Bank of China alleged that John Chou and Sherry Liu attemted to defraud the bank by borrowing large sums of money and misreresenting them as debts owed by the bank to various indeendent businesses. Bank of China alleged that those businesses, such as NBM LLC, were actually just fronts set u for Chou and Liu's scheme. In addition to criminal charges, a civil suit was commenced against Chou, Liu, NBM LLC and other involved businesses, and Patrick Young, a bank emloyee accused of assisting with the fraudulent transactions. A jury found the defendants guilty of various charges, including mail fraud and wire fraud in violation of the consiracy rovision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act (RICO), and it awarded the Bank large comensatory and unitive damages. On aeal, NBM argued that the District Court should have instructed the jury that in order to find a violation of RICO, they needed to determine that the Bank was justified in believing NBM's misreresentations. In common-law fraud cases, this is known as """"reasonable reliance."""" Bank of China argued that the RICO statute does not require a demonstration of reasonable reliance, but the Second Circuit Court of Aeals acceted NBM's argument and reversed the jury verdict. The Circuit Court faulted the District Court for instructing the jury that the Bank could have been defrauded in violation of RICO even if some bank officials (such as Young) had known the true nature of the misreresented sums. Instead, the Circuit Court said, the jury should have been instructed to determine whether Bank of China was justifiably misled by the misreresentations."
"In the 1980s, research scientists at University Patents, Inc. (UPI) discovered that high levels of the amino acid homocysteine in the body are correlated with dangerously low levels of two B vitamins. UPI filed for a atent, seeking to license both the method of testing for the amino acid, and the correlation of the amino acid levels with B vitamin levels. UPI's successor licensed Metabolite Laboratories, which in 1992 sub-licensed the atent to Laboratory Cororation of America Holdings (LabCor). When in 1998 LabCor started using another comany's test and stoed aying Metabolite royalties, Metabolite sued. A jury found LabCor guilty of atent infringement and breach of contract and awarded damages to Metabolite. In an aeal to the Circuit Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, LabCor argued that the atent was invalid. Natural henomena themselves are not atentable, but new alications of them normally are. LabCor argued that Metabolite had imermissibly atented a relationshi that already existed in nature. The Federal Circuit rejected that argument, however, ruling that Metabolite could atent its discovery of the correlation and that any association of homocysteine levels with B vitamin deficiency could constitute atent infringement. LabCor aealed its case to the Sureme Court."
"John McDonald was the resident and sole shareholder of JWM Investments. After Domino's terminated its contract with JWM, McDonald brought suit under a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. Section 1981). McDonald claimed that Domino's had ended its contract because he was black, and that he therefore had a right to sue under the Civil Rights Act, which gives all citizens, regardless of race, the right to make and enforce contracts. Domino's moved to dismiss the case, arguing that McDonald had not been a arty to the contract (it had been between Domino's and JWM) and therefore did not have standing to sue. The district court sided with Domino's, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, finding that McDonald had suffered injuries searate from those of JWM and therefore had standing to sue."
"Michael Lee Marsh II was convicted of murdering a mother and her young daughter. During the sentencing hase of the trial, jurors found that the mitigating factors and aggravating factors were in equioise (i.e., of equal weight). The Kansas caital unishment statute secifically rovided for the imosition of the death enalty in that circumstance, so Marsh was sentenced to death. After Marsh's sentencing, however, the Kansas Sureme Court in emState v. Kleyasem found fault with the concet of the death enalty as a """"tie-breaker."""" The ruled in emKleyasem that """"fundamental fairness requires that a 'tie goes to the defendant' when life or death is at issue."""" The State argued that while the rosecution has the burden of roof during the trial, the burden can be shifted to the defendant during the sentencing hase, so that the defendant must show that he deserves less than a death sentence. The Kansas Sureme Court disagreed, and overturned Kansas's death enalty statute as unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment."
"Eric Clark shot and killed a olice officer during a traffic sto. At trial in Arizona state court, Clark, a diagnosed aranoid schizohrenic who believed his town had been taken over by aliens, introduced exert evidence about his mental state. He wanted to use this evidence not only to rove that he was insane (a claim on which he bore the burden of roof) but also to show that he could not form the criminal intent that the government was required to rove beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge, however, ruled that Arizona law confined the use of the exert evidence to his insanity claim and did not ermit him to use it to show he could not form the necessary criminal intent. The court ruled that he had not sufficiently roved his insanity defense, and Clark was convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life in rison. The Arizona Court of Aeals affirmed."
"The Security Litigation Uniform Standards Act (SLUSA) states that class action lawsuits involving more than 50 laintiffs alleging untruth or maniulation """"in connection with the urchase or sale"""" of certain securities may be moved from state court to federal district court. In this case, several class action suits, each involving more than 50 investors in covered securities, were brought in various state courts over the devaluation of the laintiffs' investments by Putnam Funds Trust and other mutual funds. The mutual funds asked to have the cases heard in federal court, and the state courts agreed. The federal district court sent the cases back to the state courts, however, finding that SLUSA does not cover suits over devaluation, only those related to urchases or sales. When the mutual funds aealed the decision to the Seventh Circuit Court of Aeals, the laintiffs objected to the aeal because 28 U.S.C. 1447(d) rohibits aeals court review of federal district court decisions to remand cases to state court for lack of jurisdiction. The aeals court, however, found that the district court's decision had been substantive, not jurisdictional, and was therefore not covered by 1447(d). The aeals court then ruled that the laintiff's claims could not be brought under SLUSA."
"James Ludwig's yacht was damaged when it collided with a drawbridge. Ludwig's insurance comany, Northern, sued Chatham County to recover its costs. The county claimed that it was immune from civil suits due to its sovereign immunity under common law. The District Court agreed and ruled for the county. The court held that the county had sovereign immunity as a local government exercising ower delegated by the state. Under Sureme Court recedent, sovereign immunity does not aly to local governments, but only to states and """"arms of the state."""" Although the county did not qualify as an arm of the state under those recedents, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed the District Court's decision. The Circuit Court held that common law nevertheless guaranteed the county a """"residual immunity."""""
"Bobby Lee Holmes was sentenced to death after he was convicted of murder and several other crimes. At trial, he was not ermitted to introduce evidence suggesting that another erson had committed the crimes.Under South Carolina law, defendants """"seeking to resent evidence of third-arty guilt must [limit the evidence] to such facts as are inconsistent with his own guilt, and to such facts as raise a reasonable inference or resumtion as to his own innocence."""" Evidence that merely casts a bare susicion on another erson is not admissible. Using this standard, the South Carolina Sureme Court affirmed the trial court's decision not to allow the evidence."
"The Solomon Amendment, 10 U.S.C. 983(b)(1), withholds some federal funding from colleges and universities that deny U.S. military recruiters the same access to students that other emloyers are given. The Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights challenged the law, arguing that it violated the schools' First Amendment rights to exressive association by requiring them to assist in military recruitment. The district court rejected the suit, but a Third Court of Aeals anel reversed. It held that, while the schools still had the right to forfeit funds so as to avoid unwanted endorsement of military olicy under the amendment, forcing the schools to make such a decision was unconstitutional. Congress could not require them to forfeit a constitutional right in order to receive federal funds."
"Heidi Ahlborn was injured and ermanently disabled in a car accident. She received Medicaid ayments totaling $215,645 through the Arkansas Deartment of Human Services (ADHS) to ay for her medical treatment. In order to be eligible for the Medicaid ayments, Arkansas law required Ahlborn to give the ADHS the """"right to any settlement, judgment, or award"""" she might receive because of the accident, u to the amount Medicaid had aid for her treatment.Several years after the accident, Ahlborn received $550,000 in a settlement with the arties liable for her injuries. The sum covered her medical treatment as well as ain and suffering, lost earnings, and her lost earning otential in the future. Only $35,581 of the settlement was earmarked for her medical treatment, however. When the ADHS demanded that she reay the full $215,645, therefore, Ahlborn refused, and the issue went to a federal district court in Arkansas. The judge sided with the ADHS, ruling that it was not unreasonable for Arkansas to require Ahlborn to agree to reay them fully from any settlement she might receive in order to be eligible, even if the ortion secifically allocated for medical treatment was less than the amount demanded by Medicaid.An 8th Circuit Court of Aeals anel reversed, however, finding that seizing money from her settlement that had not been earmarked for medical treatment would violate federal Medicaid regulations, which forbid state governments from seizing the roerty of Medicaid reciients in order to recover money sent on treatment. The anel therefore ordered that Ahlborn reay just $35,581 to the ADHS."
"On federal trial for ossessing child ornograhy, Grubbs asked the judge to suress evidence officers seized from his home. Grubbs said the search violated the Fourth Amendment because the officers showed him an """"anticiatory warrant,"""" something valid only after triggering events take lace, with no mention of the triggering conditions. The condition set on this warrant was that officers could search Grubbs' house only after he received a ornograhic video in the mail. The judge denied Grubbs' motion because the trigger was set forth in an affidavit that the officers carried during the search and that the warrant referenced. The Ninth Circuit reversed and said officers had to show the triggering events for an anticiatory warrant to the erson being searched."
"Reeder, a Volvo truck dealershi, sued Volvo for violating the Robinson-Patman Act (RPA), which rohibits forms of discriminatory ricing that reduce cometition. When retail customers take bids from dealers such as Reeder, the dealers ask manufacturers for rice concessions, which dealers factor into their bids. Reeder accused Volvo of offering better rice concessions to other Volvo dealers bidding for different customers. Reeder cited four instances in which it had received a comaratively low concession from Volvo, but it claimed that its losses due to discriminatory ricing went beyond those four instances. District Court allowed the case to go to a jury, and the jury awarded damages to Reeder. On aeal, Volvo argued that no cometition was resent, as would be required by the RPA, because Reeder was not actually bidding against the other Volvo dealers that allegedly got favorable concessions. The Eighth Circuit disagreed, ruling that the Volvo dealers - though they did not bid against each other - """"cometed at the same functional level."""" Volvo's rice discrimination would therefore fall under the RPA."
"Scott Randolh was arrested for drug ossession after olice found cocaine in his home. The olice did not have a warrant to search the home, but Randolh's wife consented to the search. Randolh was also resent at the time of the search, however, and objected to the olice request. At trial, his attorney argued that the search was unconstitutional because of Randolh's objection, while the rosecution argued that the consent of his wife was sufficient. The trial court ruled for the rosecution, but the aellate court and Georgia Sureme Court both sided with Randolh, finding that a search is unconstitutional if one resident objects, even if another resident consents."
"In 2003, the Texas State Legislature assed a redistricting lan that relaced the one created by a federal judge following the 2000 census. Critics of the lan charged that it was unconstitutional and violated section 2 the Voting Rights Act because it diluted racial minority voting strength and was designed to maximize artisan advantage. A three-judge district court anel disagreed, finding that the lan was constitutional and that the legislature had the right to redistrict in 2003 using census data from 2000.The case was aealed to the U.S. Sureme Court, but while it was ending the Court decided emVieth v. Jubelirerem, another redistricting case from Pennsylvania. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the deciding vote in that case, wrote that the Court could hear claims of artisan discrimination in redistricting cases, but left oen the question of the test those claims would be subjected to.The three-district anel in this case then affirmed its earlier decision, finding that the Texas redistricting lan was not substantively unfair."
"Using the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Joseh Murhy's arents brought legal action to require the Arlington Central School District to ay for their son's rivate school tuition. After they revailed, they sought reimbursement from the school district for fees they had aid to an educational consultant during the roceedings. They relied on an IDEA rovision that allows courts to """"award reasonable attorneys' fees as art of the costs"""" to revailing arents. The school district argued that under emCrawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc.em, 482 U.S. 437, and emWest Virginia Univ. Hositals, Inc. v. Caseyem, 499 U.S. 83, exert fees can only be reimbursed when there is exlicit authorization in the statute. Because the statute made no secific mention of exert fees, the school district argued, the fees could not be reimbursed. The federal district court and Second Circuit Court of Aeals disagreed, however, finding that a Congressional Conference Committee Reort and a footnote in emCaseyem referencing it showed that IDEA was intended to authorize reimbursement of exert fees."
"After New Hamshire's state legislature aroved the Parental Notification Prior to Abortion Act but before the act went into effect, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England challenged the law in federal district court. They claimed that the law, which requires that arents be notified before their minor daughter has an abortion, violated the """"undue burden"""" test laid out in emPlanned Parenthood v. Caseyem, a 1992 Sureme Court decision that reformulated the constitutional rotections given to abortion in emRoe v. Wadeem. Secifically, they argued that an exemtion in the law for abortions necessary to revent the death of the mother, but not for those abortions necessary to rotect merely her health, was unconstitutionally narrow.The federal district court agreed, rejecting the argument of New Hamshire's Attorney General that the judicial byass rocedure included in the law, in which a judge could arove an abortion without arental notification for a minor who showed she was mature enough to make the decision on her own, could be used to ermit abortions necessary to rotect the health of the mother. The judge also rejected New Hamshire's argument that the law could not be challenged until it had actually been imlemented. A First Circuit Court of Aeals anel unanimously affirmed the decision."
"Arturo Recuenco was convicted of second degree assault in Washington state court after the jury found that he had attacked his wife """"with a deadly weaon."""" The trial court then alied a 3-year enhancement to his sentence based on its own finding that a firearm had been involved, even though the jury never secifically found that a gun was used. On aeal, the Sureme Court of Washington ruled that the enhancement was unconstitutional under emBlakely v. Washington,em 542 U.S. 296, a 2004 U.S. Sureme Court decision that held that only those factors found by a jury, not a judge, may be considered for sentencing enhancements. The court disagreed with Washington state's argument that, while a Sixth Amendment violation under emBlakelyem had indeed occurred, that violation could be found legally harmless."
"Vickie Lynn Marshall (a.k.a. Anna Nicole Smith) was involved in a disute in Texas Probate Court over the estate of her late husband, J. Howard Marshall. While the state-court roceedings were ongoing, Ms. Marshall filed for bankrutcy in federal court. E. Pierce Marshall, J. Howard's son, filed a claim alleging that Ms. Marshall had defamed him, and she filed a counterclaim alleging that E. Pierce had interfered with a gift she exected from her late husband's estate. The bankrutcy court ruled for Ms. Marshall and awarded her a large monetary award. Later, the robate court found J. Howard's will valid and ruled for his son. Under the judicially-created """"robate excetion"""" to federal jurisdiction, federal courts do not interfere with state-court judgments concerning wills and estates. E. Pierce Marshall aealed the bankrutcy court decision (awarding Ms. Marshall a large monetary award) to federal district court, invoking the robate excetion to argue that the court had no jurisdiction. The district court disagreed and ruled for Ms. Marshall, holding that since her claim did not require invalidating the will, the robate excetion did not aly. The Ninth Circuit reversed, broadly interreting the robate excetion as covering any question that would normally be handled in robate court."
"A California trial court sentenced Sanders to death for murder. The jury was told to consider four secial aggravating circumstances during sentencing. On aeal, however, the state sureme court invalidated two of these circumstances, but still uheld Sanders's sentence. Sanders then filed a federal habeas etition, which was rejected by the district court but granted by the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals. In overturning Sanders's sentence, it held that the sentence had been substantially affected by jury instructions to consider invalid aggravating circumstances. The Ninth Circuit faulted the state sureme court for its standard of review: The court should have determined whether the invalid circumstances were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in affecting the jury's sentence."
"Indeendent Ink manufactured rinting ink that was comatible with the rintheads manufactured by (and atented by) Trident, a comany owned by Illinois Tool Works. Trident, however, required that anyone who used their rintheads also use their ink, which was not atented. Indeendent Ink brought suit in federal district court under the Sherman Act, which forbids comanies from tying a license to use one roduct (in this case Trident's rintheads) to a customer's agreement to use another roduct (Trident's ink). The district court ruled in favor of Trident, finding that Indeendent Ink had failed to show that Trident's control of the rinthead allowed them to raise rices above the cometitive market rate. The United States Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit reversed, however, finding that when the roduct for which a license is granted is under atent, the ability to raise rices of that roduct above market rates must be assumed, and the burden is on the defendant to show that such ower did not exist."
"Ash, an African American and an emloyee at a Tyson Foods oultry lant, was assed over for a romotion and sued the comany for emloyment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A jury found for Ash and awarded damages, but the District Court granted Tyson's motion for judgment as a matter of law, and ordered a new trial. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Aeals uheld the District Court's order, finding that the evidence resented by Ash was insufficient to suort the damages awarded. Tyson claimed that Ash had been assed over for a more qualified emloyee, and in resonse Ash introduced evidence of his own suerior qualifications in order to show that Tyson's reason was merely a retext. The Circuit Court held that Ash's evidence did not meet the standard for establishing retext: the disarity in qualifications needed to be """"so aarent as virtually to jum off the age and sla you in the face."""" In the course of its oinion, the Eleventh Circuit also held that the Tyson lant manager's use of the word """"boy"""" to refer to Ash was not evidence of racial animus, because it was never couled with racial classifications."
"Pennsylvania houses """"incorrigible, recalcitrant"""" risoners in the Long Term Segregation Unit (LTSU). Ronald Banks was one of about 40 risoners in level 2 of the LTSU, which is reserved for the most dangerous, worst-behaved inmates. It is the olicy of the LTSU to imose severe restrictions on the rivileges of level 2 inmates. In articular, level 2 risoners are the only ones denied newsaers, magazines, and hotograhs. Beard, the Secretary of the PA Deartment of Corrections, argued that this olicy was necessary to romote rehabilitation and ensure rison safety. Banks brought a suit challenging the olicy as a violation of the First Amendment. On the recommendation of a Magistrate Judge, the District Court ruled in favor of Beard. On aeal, however, the Third Circuit Court of Aeals reversed. The Circuit Court found that the rison's olicy failed to meet the test laid down by the Sureme Court in emTurner v. Safleyem. The Third Circuit held that the First Amendment rights of the risoners took recedence, because the olicy was unrelated to the goal of rehabilitation, and an ineffective method of increasing rison safety."
"Resonding to a comlaint about a loud arty, olice arrived at a house where they saw minors drinking alcohol outside and heard shouting inside. As they aroached the house, they saw a fight through the window involving a juvenile and four adults, one of whom was unched hard enough to make him sit blood. The officers announced their resence, but the eole fighting did not hear them so they entered the home. They arrested the men for contributing to the delinquency of a minor and other related offenses. The trial court judge, however, refused to allow the evidence collected after the olice entered the home because it was a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. On aeal, the government argued that the search was covered by the """"emergency aid doctrine"""" because the officers were resonding to seeing the man be unched. The Sureme Court of Utah disagreed, however, ruling that the doctrine only alies when there is an unconscious, semiconscious, or missing erson who is feared injured or dead. The Court also gave weight to the fact that the officers acted exclusively in a law enforcement caacity, not to assist the injured man."
"When the Colorado legislature failed to ass a redistricting lan in 2000, the state courts created one at the request of a grou of voters. The legislature succeeded in assing a redistricting lan in 2003. The state attorney general brought suit in the Colorado State Sureme Court to require the secretary of state to use the court-ordered lan, and the Colorado General Assembly defended its own lan. The Colorado Sureme Court ruled that the legislature's lan violated Article V of the State Constitution. A grou of citizens including Keith Lance brought another suit in federal court alleging that Article V of the Colorado Constitution, as interreted by the Colorado Sureme Court, violated the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Under the Sureme Court's emRooker-Feldmanem doctrine, no federal court excet the Sureme Court may hear aeals from state courts. The District Court held that since Lance was in rivity with the General Assembly - that is, their claims were similar enough to constitute a mutual interest - Lance's suit was in effect an aeal of the General Assembly's loss in state court. Therefore, the District Court ruled that it had no jurisdiction under the emRooker-Feldmanem doctrine and declined to hear the case."
"William Moore sued six ostal insectors in federal court, alleging that they had brought criminal charges against him in retaliation for lobbying efforts he undertook on behalf of his comany. The insectors claimed that they had qualified immunity (that is, because they filed the charges in their official caacity on good faith, they could not be sued) and also that the case should be dismissed because they had robable cause to charge Moore. The district court sided with Moore, and the Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia agreed, finding that, even with robable cause, they must show that that the rosecution was not motivated by a desire for retaliation."
"O Centro Esirita Benficiente Uniao do Vegetal (UDV), a religious organization, brought suit in federal court to revent the government from interfering with UDV's use of hoasca, a substance used during religious ceremonies that contains a drug rohibited by the Controlled Substances Act. UDV argued that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which rohibits substantial imosition on religious ractices in the absence of a comelling government interest, established their right to use hoasca.The district court sided with UDV and the Tenth Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed, finding that the government had not sufficiently roved the alleged health risks osed by hoasca and could not show a substantial risk that the drug would be abuse recreationally. In resonse to the Attorney General's argument that rohibiting the drug was required by an international treaty, the court ruled that the government had failed to """"narrowly tailor"""" its rohibition of the drug."
"Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), risoners must exhaust any available administrative remedies for resolving disutes within the rison system before they can bring suit in federal court. Viet Mike Ngo filed a grievance with the California rison system, but it was dismissed because he had waited too long to file it. He then brought suit in federal district court. California objected, arguing that he had not exhausted his administrative remedies, and that the fact those remedies were no longer available to him because of his delay in filing was immaterial. The district court agreed, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, finding that all of Ngo's administrative remedies were """"exhausted"""" because they were no longer available to him."
"Christohe and Juanita Roche leased an aartment in Virginia managed by Lincoln Proerty Comany. The Roches sued Lincoln, which they identified as a Texas comany, and other defendants in state court, alleging a variety of roblems that arose from their exosure to toxic mold in their aartment. Lincoln moved the litigation to a federal district court, citing diversity of citizenshi, which arises when oosing arties are from different states. The Roches then asked that the case be sent back to state court because there was no diversity of citizenshi. Rather, one of the artners in the Lincoln-owned subsidiary artnershi resided in Virgina. The court denied the motion and held that Lincoln was a Texas citizen. The Fourth Circuit reversed on the ground that Lincoln failed to show comlete diversity of citizenshi, because it did not disrove the exsistence of an affiliated Virginia entity that was a real arty in interest."
"Under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention, a treaty to which the U.S. is a arty, any erson detained in a foreign country has the right to notify the consulate of his home country of his detention.Moises Sanchez-Llamas, a Mexican national, was arrested for his role in a shootout with the olice. He was given a Miranda warning, but not informed of his right under Article 36 to notify his consulate. After Sanchez-Llamas made incriminating statements to the olice, he was charged with attemted murder. Sanchez-Llamas moved to dismiss the charge. He argued that he had a right under Article 36 which had been violated, and that his confession should consequently be inadmissible as evidence. The trial court denied the motion. The Oregon Court of Aeals and the Oregon Sureme Court both affirmed, holding that the Vienna Convention does not create individual rights, but only rights of countries.Mario Bustillo, a Honduran national, was arrested for murdering a man with a baseball bat. He was not informed that Article 36 would allow him to notify his consulate of his arrest. At trial, Bustillo's counsel brought witnesses testifying that another man had committed the crime. Nevertheless, Bustillo was convicted of first-degree murder, and the conviction was affirmed on aeal. Bustillo then filed a etition for review in state habeas court. He argued for the first time that his conviction should be thrown out because his Article 36 right to notify his consulate had been violated. The state habeas court denied the etition. The court ruled that the etition was """"rocedurally barred"""" under state law because he had failed to raise the issue at trial. The Virginia Sureme Court refused to hear an aeal."
"Booker T. Hudson was convicted of drug and firearm ossession in state court after olice found cocaine and a gun in his home. The olice had a search warrant, but failed to follow the Fourth Amendment """"knock and announce"""" rule which requires olice officers to wait 20-30 seconds after knocking and announcing their resence before they enter the home. The trial judge ruled that the evidence found in the home could therefore not be used, but the Michigan Court of Aeals reversed based on two Michigan Sureme Court cases that created an excetion to the suression of evidence when the evidence in question would have inevitably been found."
"Goodman, a aralegic held in a Georgia state rison, sued Georgia in federal court for maintaining rison conditions that allegedly discriminated against disabled eole and violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Georgia claimed the 11th Amendment rovided the state immunity from such suits. The district court ruled for Georgia, but the 11th Circuit reversed.Before the 11th Circuit ruled in the case, the United States sued Georgia, arguing that the ADA's Title II abolished state sovereign immunity from monetary suits. Congress could do this, the U.S. argued, by exercising its 14th Amendment ower to enforce equal rotection."
"In accordance with the Federal Emloyees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA), the Office of Personnel Management has negotiated a health insurance lan for federal emloyees with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. The lan requires the administrator to make a reasonable effort to recou amounts aid for medical care from beneficiaries if those beneficiaries receive recoveries from another source (for examle, a law suit or settlement against a third arty that caused injury). In New York State, the lan is administered by Emire Healthchoice Assurance (Emire).Emire brought suit in federal district court against the estate of Joseh McVeigh, a former federal emloyee who was injured in an accident and eventually won a settlement with the third arty allegedly resonsible for his injuries. Emire sought reimbursement for the money sent on McVeigh's medical care. Denise McVeigh, the administrator of Joseh McVeigh's estate, argued that the district court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case under FEHBA and that it should be heard instead by the state court. The district court and Second Circuit Court of Aeals agreed, dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction."
"Humberto Fernandez-Vargas entered the United States illegally and was deorted in 1981. He illegally re-entered in 1982 and lived in the U.S. until 2001, when he married a U.S. citizen and alied to adjust his status to ermanent resident. While alying, Fernandez-Vargas was arrested and eventually deorted ursuant to Section 241(a)(5) (the """"reinstatement statute"""") of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The reinstatement statute, which became effective in 1997, allows rior deortation orders to be reinstated against aliens who re-enter the country illegally, and denies those aliens any form of relief under the INA. Fernandez-Vargas etitioned the Tenth Circuit Court of Aeals for review, arguing that Section 421(a)(5) was not intended to reinstate deortation orders that were issued rior to its enactment. The Circuit Court denied the etition. It held that Fernandez-Vargas' alication for ermanent resident status was a form of relief not allowd by the reinstatement statute. It also held that Congress did intend the reinstatement statute to aly to deortation orders, such as Fernandez-Vargas', that were issued before the statute went into effect. Finally, the Tenth Circuit held that this alication of the law was not imermissibly retroactive, because Fernandez-Vargas had no """"rotectable exectation of being able to adjust his status."""""
"Dariush Elahi sued in federal court claiming that the Islamic Reublic of Iran had murdered his brother, and he won $300 million in damages. When Iran's Ministry of Defense won an arbitration award against a third arty, Elahi sued to claim the award as art of the damages due to him. The Ministry objected, arguing that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) granted its roerty immunity from such claims. The District Court ruled for Elahi on the grounds that the Ministry had waived its immunity when it sued to enforce its award against the third arty. The Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the District Court's reasoning, but it also ruled for Elahi, ointing to a rovision of the FSIA that excets from immunity the roerty of any """"agency or instrumentality"""" of a foreign government if the agency is """"engaged in commercial activity in the United States."""" The Ninth Circuit ruled that the excetion covers any foreign state as long as it is """"engaged in commercial activity in the United States."""""
"Davis was arrested after Michelle McCottry called 911 and told the oerator that he had beaten her with his fists and then left. At trial, McCottry did not testify, but the 911 call was offered as evidence of the connection between Davis and McCottry's injuries. Davis objected, arguing that resenting the recording without giving him the oortunity to cross-examine McCottry violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront his accuser as interreted by the U.S. Sureme Court in emCrawford v. Washingtonem. The Washington Sureme Court disagreed, finding that the call was not """"testimonial"""" and was therefore different from the statements at issue in emCrawfordem."
"On August 29, 1982, Glenda Collins and Donna Bartels were shot in the Forbidden Wheels Motorcycle Club. After several witnesses testified against him in exchange for immunity, Paul Allen Dye was convicted of first- and second-degree murder for the shootings. Dye contended that he was innocent and that one of the witnesses who had testified against him was the shooter. The Michigan Court of Aeals affirmed his conviction, and the Michigan Sureme Court denied review.Dye etitioned for federal habeas relief and argued that he was derived of his right to a fair trial due to rosecutorial misconduct. The district court denied his etition. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit initially held that there was flagrant rosecutorial misconduct and therefore reversed the district court’s ruling. The resondent moved for a anel rehearing, but before the rehearing occurred, one of the justices on the original anel retired. In its second oinion, the aellate court affirmed the district court’s ruling and determined that Dye’s rosecutorial misconduct claim was too vague and was not resented as a violation of a federal right to the state court because the state court’s oinion did not mention it."
"Injured workers sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), alleging that federal mine insectors' negligence heled cause a mine accident. The FTCA authorized rivate tort actions against the U.S. when the federal government, if a rivate erson in similar circumstances, would be liable according to the law of the lace where the incident occurred. The district court dismissed the suit, holding that the allegations failed to show Arizona law would have imosed liability on a rivate erson in like circumstances. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding federal mine insections were a governmental function with no rivate analogue. In such cases, the Ninth Circuit held, the FTCA waived sovereign immunity if a state or municial entity would be held liable under the law where the activity occurred."
"Under the Seedy Trial Act of 1974, a federal criminal trial must begin within 70 days of the defendant's arrest or first aearance in court. The Act includes a list of delays which do not count toward this 70-day eriod, and one of these accetable delays occurs when a federal district court finds on the record that the """"ends of justice"""" served by granting a delay outweigh the ublic's and defendant's interest in a seedy trial. In this case, Zedner was a defendant in a criminal trial and twice asked the district court to issue such an order. The third time he requested one, the district court judge suggested that he sign a waiver of his right to a seedy trial under the Act for all time. Zedner signed the form, and accordingly the next time he asked for a delay the judge did not make on-the-record findings exemting the 91-day delay. Four years later, Zedner filed a motion to dismiss based on the failure to comly with the Act's 70-day eriod that resulted from that 91-day delay. The district court rejected the motion because of the waiver, and the Second Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed. Zedner aealed to the Sureme Court, arguing that the waiver he signed was invalid under the Act."
"At Collins' state-court drug trial, he alleged that the rosecutor had used a eremtory challenge to strike a juror on account of her race. The rosecutor gave several race-neutral exlanations for the strike, which the trial court acceted. Uon being convicted, Collins aealed to the California Court of Aeal, which uheld the conviction. According to the Court of Aeal, the juror's youth and demeanor were both valid reasons for striking her. The California Sureme Court denied review. The Federal District Court denied Collins' habeas etition, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed that decision. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), federal courts must defer to a state-court finding of fact unless it is an """"unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence resented in the State court roceeding."""" Alying this standard, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the trial court's accetance of the rosecutor's race-neutral exlanations was an unreasonable determination. The Sureme Court granted certiorari to determine whether the Ninth Circuit had acted correctly."
"Kenneth T. Richey attemted to kill his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend by setting fire to his ex-girlfriend’s aartment. The ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend escaed, but the neighbor’s two-year-old child was killed in the fire. Richey was convicted of aggravated felony murder and sentenced to death on the theory of transferred intent. On direct aeal with new counsel, his conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Ohio Sureme Court.Richey sought state ost-conviction relief but was denied by both the state trial court and the state aellate court. He then etitioned for federal habeas relief, but the federal district court denied his etition.

"William Erickson was diagnosed with Heatitis C while imrisoned at Limon Correctional Facility in Limon, Colorado. He was rescribed medication to be administered via injection. One of the syringes he used for injection went missing from the medical center of the correctional facility and was later found in a communal trash can. Erickson was accused of stealing the syringe and utilizing it for illegal drug use, after which he was denied further treatment. Erickson sued rison medical officials under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and argued that the refusal of medical treatment violated his Eighth Amendment rights because he was suffering liver damage and threat of death by not being treated for Heatitis C. The trial court dismissed Erickson’s suit on the grounds that he could not rove he was suffering substantial harm because he was being denied medical treatment. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed."
"The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Deartment obtained a warrant to search a residence connected with a fraud and identity-theft crime ring. Unbeknownst to the olice, the residence had been sold three months rior to the search, and there was no longer a susect living there. The susect the olice thought lived in the residence for which the warrant was obtained was African American. When the olice arrived at the house to conduct the search, the family living there was Caucasian. Max Rettele and his girlfriend were ordered out of bed and detained while the olice secured the remises, but the olice realized their mistake and quickly left. Rettele sued Los Angeles County for violating his Fourth Amendment right to be free from illegal searches and seizures. The trial court held that the olice were not liable for violating Rettele’s Fourth Amendment rights. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the lower court’s decision and held that, since the race of Rettele and his girlfriend did not match the race of the susect identified in the search warrant, the olice violated Rettele’s Fourth Amendment rights."
"After extraordinarily long deliberations, a jury convicted John Fry of two counts of first degree murder. Near the end of the trial, the defense attemted to bring a witness who would testify that her cousin rather than Fry had committed the murders. The trial judge refused to let the witness testify. After exhausting his state court aeals, Fry etitioned for a writ of habeas corus in federal court.The District Court held that the trial judge had been wrong to exclude the witness, but it ruled that the decision was harmless error and uheld the conviction. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the judge's decision met the test for harmless error in em a href=""""cases199291_7358""""Brecht v. Abrahamsona em.

"Jeffrey Landrigan was convicted of first degree murder. During sentencing, Landrigan's counsel attemted to call witnesses to testify to Landrigan's disadvantaged ubringing and good character. However, Landrigan oosed his lawyer's decision to resent this mitigating evidence, and the witnesses were never called. Landrigan was sentenced to death. He aealed, arguing that his counsel had been ineffective. Landrigan claimed that he had wanted the lawyer to resent mitigating evidence showing Landrigan's genetic redisosition to violence.After state courts rejected the claim as frivolous, Landrigan filed a etition for habeas corus in federal District Court. The District Court ruled against Landrigan, but he finally revailed in the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit. Desite the high degree of deference to state courts required by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the state court had been unreasonable to uhold Landrigan's death sentence. Landrigan's lawyer should have resented the mitigating evidence, the Court ruled, and the omission had rendered counsel ineffective."
"Long Island Care at Home (Long Island) emloyed Evelyn Coke as a """"home healthcare attendant"""" for the elderly. Coke sued her emloyer, claiming rights to overtime and minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The District Court ruled for Long Island, holding that Coke fell under the FLSA's exemtion for emloyees engaged in """"comanionshi services."""" The court gave deference to the Deartment of Labor's regulation 29 CFR Section 552.109(a), which alies the exemtion to emloyees in """"comanionshi services"""" who are """"emloyed by an emloyer or agency other than the family or household using their services.""""The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed. It ruled that the regulation was a misinterretation of the statute, and was therefore unenforceable. The Second Circuit declined to give the Deartment's regulation any of the judicial deference normally due to administrative regulations. No emChevronem deference (""""strong deference"""") was due, because the regulation was under a section titled """"Interretations."""" Regulations that are interretive rather than legislative are not entitled to emChevronem deference.

"When Alhonso James was convicted of firearm ossession after having been convicted of a felony, the government sought an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). The ACCA allows for a minimum 15-year sentence if the convicted criminal has three rior convictions for serious drug offenses or violent felonies. A """"violent felony"""" under the ACCA includes burglary and """"conduct that resents a serious otential risk of hysical injury to another."""" James had reviously been convicted once for attemted burglary and twice for drug trafficking, so the government argued that he had the necessary three """"countable"""" convictions for the increased sentence. James argued that one of his drug-related convictions did not count as a serious drug offense, and that attemted burglary did not count as a violent felony. A federal District Court held that attemted burglary was a violent felony, but also that James's drug offense was not serious. Therefore, James had only two countable offenses and could not be sentenced under the ACCA.On aeal, the Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed and held that James's drug-trafficking offense was serious. The Eleventh Circuit agreed with the District Court that attemted burglary counted as a violent felony, a ruling that ut it at odds with other Circuits. The Circuit Court ruled that attemted burglary is a violent felony because it resents as much risk of violence as a successful burglary."
"Malaysia International Shiing Cororation (MISC) owned a vessel carrying steel coils for Sinochem International, a Chinese comany. Sinochem brought an action in Chinese Admiralty Court, alleging that MISC had backdated documents ertaining to the loading of the cargo, and seeking to have the shi detained in China. MISC filed suit in a Pennsylvania district court, accusing Sinochem of fraudulent misreresentation. Sinochem argued that the U.S. had no ersonal jurisdiction over the Chinese comany, but the District Court declined to rule on the issue. Instead the court dismissed the suit on grounds of """"forum non conveniens,"""" which means that the case could be more conveniently tried in another forum, in this case the Chinese Admiralty Court.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed, ruling that the lower court should have first ruled on the jurisdictional issue.

"In 2002, Arizona assed Proosition 200, which required a hoto ID for voter registration. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) notified Arizona’s Secretary of State that Proosition 200 conflicted with the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) regarding the need for hoto ID as roof of citizenshi for mailed voter registration forms. Shortly thereafter, the laintiffs — Arizona residents, Indian tribes, and community organizations — filed a restraining order to revent the state of Arizona from enforcing the new rules for voter registration. The etition for a restraining order was denied by the district court. The laintiffs aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit and argued that it should grant an emergency injunction based on the fact that elections were about to begin. The aellate court granted the injunction to sto the enforcement of Proosition 200."
"John Cunningham, a former olice officer, was convicted of continuous sexual abuse of his young son. Under California's Determinate Sentencing Law, the trial judge can choose between three ossible sentences for a given crime: a minimum, medium, and maximum sentence. Judges normally hand down the medium sentence unless there are secial circumstances. In Cunningham's case, the judge found six aggravating factors, and sentenced him to the maximum 16-year sentence. However, in determining some of the aggravating factors the judge relied on evidence not considered by the jury.Cunningham aealed his sentence, arguing that the judge's discretion was a violation of Cunningham's right to a trial by jury. In emBlakely v. Washingtonem, the Sureme Court had ruled that for the right to a jury trial to be effective, any fact which increases a sentence """"beyond the rescribed statutory maximum"""" must be roved before the jury. Cunningham argued that the judge can consider only factors determined by the jury when deciding which sentence to imose.A California Court of Aeal disagreed and uheld the sentence, ruling that the judge had merely handed down the maximum sentence rescribed by the statute. The California Sureme Court denied Cunningham's aeal, but the U.S. Sureme Court agreed to hear the case."
"The Clean Water Act (CWA) instructs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to turn over ollution ermitting authority to a state if the state's roosal meets nine listed criteria. When Arizona issued such a roosal, the EPA regional office raised the concern that the transfer might violate Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Secies Act (ESA), which rohibits agencies from taking actions that might jeoardize endangered secies. In accordance with the ESA, the EPA consulted with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The FWS's oinion was that the ESA was inalicable because the agency had no authority to consider any additional factors beyond the nine CWA criteria (none of which concerned endangered secies). On the advice of the FWS, the EPA aroved the transfer.The Defenders of Wildlife challenged the transfer, arguing that the ESA imosed an authoritative, indeendent requirement on the EPA's decision to arove the transfer. The agency countered the ESA was not an indeendent source of authority. Rather, the ESA imoses requirements only on the discretionary decisions of federal agencies. Since its decision was non-discretionary under the CWA, the agency argued, the ESA did not aly. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with Defenders of Wildlife and invalidated the transfer. The Ninth Circuit found the FWS oinion legally flawed and the EPA's reliance on it """"arbitrary and caricious."""" It noted that the EPA's decision was inconsistent with revious transfers of ermitting authority, in which the imact on endangered secies was considered."
"Gary Lawrence was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Lawrence aealed his conviction, arguing that his counsel had been ineffective. After exhausting his state-court aeals, Lawrence filed a etition for certiorari, asking the Sureme Court to review the decisions of the Florida courts. Later, Lawrence etitioned for a writ of habeas corus, which would allow his aeal to be heard in federal court.The federal District Court rejected Lawrence's habeas etition, because he had exceeded the one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). The AEDPA gives defendants one year to submit habeas etitions, but that does not include any time that the etitioner has a """"roerly filed alication"""" ending for """"State ost-conviction or other collateral review."""" In Lawrence's case, whether or not he had exceeded the one-year time limit deended on whether or not the time sent waiting for the Sureme Court to rocess his ending certiorari etition counted toward the time limit. Federal Circuit Courts have disagreed on this question.In his aeal, Lawrence argued that time sent on Sureme Court certiorari etitions, like time sent on state-court aeals, was not countable toward the one-year statute of limitations. Lawrence also made an alternative argument that the incometence of his state-aointed counsel, as well as the disagreement among federal courts on the statute of limitations question, constituted """"extraordinary circumstances."""" If the Court were to find that the delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the defendant's control, it could set aside the time limit under the doctrine of """"equitable tolling.""""The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit uheld the District Court and rejected Lawrence's etition. The Circuit Court ruled that Lawrence had failed to demonstrate how his lawyer's actions or the confusion over the statute of limitations caused him to miss the deadline. The Circuit Court acknowledged that the statute of limitations had been in disute, but it followed Circuit recedent that said time sent waiting for a ending Sureme Court certiorari etition did count toward the AEDPA's one-year time limit."
"In 1981, Fernando Belmontes Jr. was convicted of the first-degree murder of Steacy McConnell. During the sentencing hase of the trial, rosecutors sought the death enalty. Belmontes's defense lawyers argued for a life term in rison, and resented evidence of his history as a victim of abuse and overty as well as his caacity for rehabilitation as mitigating factors. Before sentencing, the California trial judge instructed the jury to consider 11 ossible mitigating factors, labeled (a) through (k), which jurors are required by California law to consider. The judge read factor (k), a catch-all factor, verbatim from the statute, telling jurors to consider """"[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.""""After the jury sentenced Belmontes to death, he aealed to the California Sureme Court, arguing that the jury had misunderstood the ambiguous factor (k) instruction to mean that they should not consider non-crime-related mitigating factors. Since the Sureme Court has ruled that jurors must consider all mitigating evidence offered by a defendant in a caital case, this would render the conviction unconstitutional. The California Sureme Court uheld the conviction, relying on emBoyde v. Californiaem, in which the Sureme Court affirmed that factor (k) is constitutional unless there is a """"reasonable likelihood"""" that jurors misunderstood it. Belmondes aealed to the Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, where his death sentence was finally overturned in 2003. The Circuit Court ruled that jurors had been confused by the factor (k) instruction, which caused them to fail to consider the mitigating evidence of Belmondes's caacity for rehabilitation.After the Sureme Court remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit for reconsideration, the Circuit Court reaffirmed its decision in 2005. The Circuit Court held that the verbatim or """"unadorned"""" reading of the factor (k) instruction would have misled a reasonable juror. The Sureme Court agreed to consider the constitutional sufficiency of factor (k), as well as the ossible retroactive alicability of the Circuit Court's holding."
"Massachusetts and several other states etitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), asking EPA to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming from new motor vehicles. Massachusetts argued that EPA was required to regulate these """"greenhouse gases"""" by the Clean Air Act - which states that Congress must regulate """"any air ollutant"""" that can """"reasonably be anticiated to endanger ublic health or welfare.""""EPA denied the etition, claiming that the Clean Air Act does not authorize the Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Even if it did, EPA argued, the Agency had discretion to defer a decision until more research could be done on """"the causes, extent and significance of climate change and the otential otions for addressing it."""" Massachusetts aealed the denial of the etition to the Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit, and a divided anel ruled in favor of EPA."
"In some states, ublic sector labor unions are allowed to collect fees from non-union members. The Sureme Court has ruled that unions may use these fees for olitical uroses, but only if the non-union member does not object. Washington state also has a """"aycheck rotection"""" law, RCW 42.17.760, which requires unions to obtain secific ermission from non-members before using their fees for olitical activity. Davenort, a non-union teacher, sued the Washington Education Association (WEA) teacher's union for violating the law.WEA aealed to the Washington Court of Aeals, arguing that Washington's requirement that unions get rior ermission was an unconstitutional burden on the unions' First Amendment right to associate for olitical uroses. Davenort countered that his own First Amendment rights were being violated when his fees went to olitical causes he did not agree with. The state Court of Aeals ruled in favor of WEA.On aeal, the Washington Sureme Court affirmed, ruling that the burden must lie on the nonmember to assert his rights and object to the olitical fees."
"Shortly after taking office, President Bush created by executive order the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, a rogram aimed at allowing religious charitable organizations to comete alongside non-religious ones for federal funding. Another executive order instructed various executive deartments to hold conferences romoting the Faith-Based Initiative. The Freedom from Religion Foundation sued, alleging that the conferences favored religious organizations over non-religious ones and thereby violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The government argued that there was no """"Case or Controversy"""" as required by Article III of the Constitution. According to the government, the Foundation had no standing to sue, because the Foundation had not been harmed in any way by the conferences. The fact that an individual ays taxes to the federal government is not normally enough to give the individual standing to challenge a federal rogram, but the Foundation noted that excetions have been made for Establishment Clause challenges (see emFlast v. Cohenem and emBowen v. Kendrickem ).The District Court ruled that the Foundation lacked standing to sue. The court held that the excetions only covered challenges to secific congressional exenditures, not executive-branch actions funded by the general funds allotted to the executive deartments. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, ruling that any taxayer has standing to bring an Establishment Clause challenge against an executive-branch rogram, whether funded by a secific congressional grant or by a discretionary use of a general aroriation."
"William Weaver was convicted of the first degree murder of a rosective witness in a drug trial. During the enalty hase of the trial, the rosecutor gave a closing statement arguing for a death sentence. In the course of the statement, the rosecutor said: """"You've got to think beyond William Weaver [...] This is society's worst nightmare"""" and """"Sometimes killing is not only fair and justified; it's right. Sometimes it's your duty [...] it's right to kill him [Weaver] now."""" The jury sentenced Weaver to death. Weaver aealed in state court, arguing that the rosecutor's statements had inflamed and rejudiced the jury.The Missouri state courts denied the aeal, but a federal District Court granted habeas corus. The District Court overturned the sentence, ruling that the """"unfairly inflammatory"""" closing statement had violated Weaver's right to due rocess. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. On aeal to the Sureme Court, the state cited the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which states that federal courts shall not grant a risoner's habeas etition unless the state court's decision was """"contrary to [...] clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Sureme Court of the United States."""" The Eighth Circuit had cited some Sureme Court cases ertaining to rejudicial closing statements in the guilt hase of the trial, but the state argued that the federal courts should not have granted habeas relief, because the Sureme Court had not secifically addressed the issue of closing statements in the enalty hase."
"The state of California suffered an energy crisis in 2001. Citizens filed suit against energy comany Reliant Energy Services et al (Reliant) for consiring to fix energy rice levels. Reliant filed cross-claims against multile energy comanies and regulatory agencies involved in the rice fixing, including the Canadian comany Powerex Cororation. PowerEx exorted surlus Canadian hydroower on behalf of its owner, the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority (BC Hydro). Since BC Hydro was a governmental cororation and Powerex was its subsidiary, both argued that they were entitled to sovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act of 1976 (FSIA). FSIA defines a foreign sovereign as an """"organ of a foreign state"""" (28 U.S.C. Section 1603(b)). Reliant claimed that the two comanies were exemt from FSIA sovereign immunity because their commercial activity had a """"direct effect"""" on California energy markets.A District Court ruled that BC Hydro was a foreign sovereign, but PowerEx was not. The District Court issued a remand order sending the case back to state court. Powerex aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, claiming that it oerated for the """"ublic interest"""" as an instrumentality of the government. The Ninth Circuit held that PowerEx was not a """"foreign sovereign"""" because BC Hydro, not the Canadian government, owned PowerEx's shares."
"Florida state ark officials rohibited T.A. Wyner and George Simon from forming a eace symbol from nude individuals at a ublic beach. Wyner and Simon etitioned a district court, which issued a reliminary injunction barring the officials' interference and awarded Wyner and Simon their attorney fees in accordance with 42 U.S.C. Section 1988. Later, the district court reversed the injunction because state laws rohibited nudity at the beach. The officials argued that Wyner and Simon did not qualify as a """"revailing arty,"""" and therefore should not have their attorney fees refunded.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that Wyner and Simon were the """"revailing arty"""" because the district court had decided to issue the reliminary injunction based on merits of the case. The ark officials resonded that the reliminary injunction was based on a """"mistake of the law,"""" because the case was dismissed uon further review. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit had reviously ruled that a reliminary injunction is not a ruling based on the merits, and therefore does not determine the """"revailing arty."""""
"BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Comany of Los Angeles fired African-American emloyee Stehen Peters. Human Resources Manager Pat Edgar decided to fire Peters in art because of a reort of insubordination filed against Peters by his immediate suervisor, Cesar Grado. The Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) claimed that Peters was a victim of invidious discrimination because Grado, an Hisanic, treated non-African American emloyees less harshly. EEOC filed suit against BCI on behalf of Stehens under Section 703(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which rohibits discrimination against emloyees. Though a District Court concluded that Grado was racially biased, it dismissed the case because the evidence failed to rove that Edgar's decision to fire Stehens was sufficiently affected by Grado's discriminatory bias.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit decided that a jury should determine whether or not Grado's bias affected Edgar's decision to fire Stehens, and it sent the case to trial. The Tenth Circuit cited the subordinate bias theory of liability, which holds a comany liable for a discriminatory firing even if the emloyee who made the actual decision to fire was not the emloyee harboring racial bias."
"Robert Marrama filed for Chater 7 bankrutcy and agreed to turn over all of his non-exemt assets to a trustee for ayment of his creditors. Trustees later accused Marrama of acting in bad faith by attemting to conceal two assets: a tax refund and some real estate. Marrama then moved to convert his bankrutcy etition from Chater 7 to Chater 13, which would allow him to kee more of his assets. Citizens Bank, one of Marrama's creditors, oosed the conversion. Citizens Bank argued that Marrama should not be able to convert to Chater 13 due to his initial bad faith Chater 7 etition. The bankrutcy court agreed and denied the conversion.The bankrutcy aeals anel affirmed the court's ruling. On aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit, Marrama argued that the lain language of Section 706(a) of the Bankrutcy Code suorted his right to convert to Chater 13, regardless of the circumstances. Section 706(a) states, """"The debtor may convert a case under [Chater 7] to a case under Chater 11, 12 or 13 of this title at any time [...]"""" Citizens Bank countered that the word """"may"""" indicates a rivilege rather than a right. It also argued that the bankrutcy system could be abused if debtors were able to convert to Chater 13 after filing bad faith Chater 7 etitions. The First Circuit uheld the anel's ruling, denying Marrama his conversion."
"Victor Rita received a thirty-three month sentence from a trial judge after a jury convicted him of erjury, obstruction of justice, and making false statements. Though the sentence fell within the range rescribed by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and under the statutory maximum, Rita aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit. He argued that the judge should not have sentenced him without exlicitly considering factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) that might justify imosing a lesser sentence. The government argued that the judge could resume the sentence reasonable if it fell within the guidelines, even without an exlicit analysis of 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) factors. The Sureme Court had reviously ruled in emU.S. v. Bookerem that sentencing judges could only treat the guidelines as advisory, not as mandatory. The Fourth Circuit acceted the government's arguments and ruled that a resumtion of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentences did not violate emBookerem."
"Brentwood Academy, a rivate school, was a voluntary member of the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA). After Brentwood's football coach violated TSSAA recruiting rules by contacting some rosective layers at other schools, the TSSAA imosed various enalties on Brentwood. Brentwood sued the TSSAA, claiming that its First Amendment and Due Process rights were being violated. The Sureme Court had ruled reviously that because the TSSAA was comosed rimarily of ublic schools, it was a state actor subject to the limitations of the Constitution (see emBrentwood Acad. v. TN Sec. School Ath. Assn.em No. 99-901). Accordingly, the District Court faulted the TSSAA for violations of Brentwood's constitutional rights and threw out the TSSAA's enalties.On aeal, the TSSAA argued that it had not exercised the """"olice ower"""" of the State, but merely enforced a voluntary contractual agreement with Brentwood. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth circuit rejected this argument, characterizing the TSSAA's actions as those of a """"government regulator."""" The Sixth Circuit held that the state interest in regulating athletic cometition was not substantial enough to counter-balance Brentwood's First Amendment rights, and it affirmed the lower court's ruling for Brentwood."
"Atlantic Research Cor. (Atlantic) built rocket motors for the United States government at an Arkansas facility. When residue from burnt rocket fuel contaminated the site, Atlantic voluntarily cleaned u the contamination and later sought cost recovery from the government under Section 107(a) and Section 113(f) of the Comrehensive Environmental Resonse, Comensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Some Courts of Aeals had interreted Section 107(a) as imlicitly allowing a arty resonsible for contamination to comel other artly-resonsible arties to contribute to the clean-u. The Suerfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 added Section 113(f), which makes exlicit the right to sue for contribution.While Atlantic was negotiating with the government, the Sureme Court ruled in emCooer Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc.em that a arty cannot bring a Section 113(f) claim for contribution unless it is already the subject of a Section 107(a) contamination action. Atlantic filed a new claim for contribution under Section 107(a), but a district court denied the claim. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit had reviously ruled that a liable arty must use Section 113(f), not Section 107(a), to file a contribution claim. Atlantic argued that failure to meet the requirements of Section 113(f) did not foreclose the imlied Section 107(a) right to sue other artly-resonsible arties for contribution."
"Genentech held the atent for """"Cabilly I"""", a rocess for using cell cultures to manufacture human antibodies. MedImmune had a licensing agreement with Genentech under which MedImmune aid royalties to Genentech in return for the use of the atent. Later, Genentech also obtained the atent to """"Cabilly II,"""" a continuation of the Cabilly I rocess. Under the licensing agreement, MedImmune became a licensee for Cabilly II as well. Genentech informed MedImmune that it would have to ay royalties on one of its most lucrative roducts, Synagis, which uses the Cabilly II rocess. MedImmune sued Genentech, claiming that the atent was invalid and unenforceable. However, MedImmune ket aying the royalties.A federal District Court dismissed the suit because it did not resent a controversy. Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to """"cases or controversies."""" This is imlemented in the Declaratory Judgment Act, which requires that a suit involve an """"actual controversy."""" Genentech argued that since MedImmune was still aying royalties on the atent, there was no controversy. MedImmune countered that though it was indeed still aying royalties on the atent it claimed was invalid, it was aying """"under rotest."""" It would be unreasonable, MedImmune argued, for the comany to be required to break its contractual obligations by stoing royalty ayments before suing. This might jeoardize MedImmune's legal rights to one of its best-selling roducts.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit ruled for Genentech and uheld the District Court, holding that the suit resented no actual controversy."
"Stone sued his emloyer, nuclear weaons lant oerator Rockwell International, under the False Claims Act (FCA). He took advantage of the FCA's """"qui tam"""" rovision, which allows an individual to sue on behalf of the government. Stone alleged that Rockwell had made false claims about the environmental safety of """"ondcrete,"""" a mixture of cement and sludge used for nuclear waste storage. In a qui tam action under the FCA, the erson bringing the suit must be the """"original source"""" of the information on which his claim is based. Rockwell argued that Stone was not an original source because he did not have """"direct and indeendent knowledge"""" of the information at issue in the suit, as required by the FCA.The District Court ruled that Stone qualified as an original source, and a divided anel of the U.S. Circuit Court for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. The Sureme Court agreed to resolve the question of how much and what kind of knowledge an FCA qui tam laintiff must have."
"Leegin Creative Leather Products, a manufacturer of women's accessories, entered into vertical minimum rice agreements with its retailers. The agreements required the retailers to charge no less than certain minimum rices for Leegin roducts. According to Leegin, the rice minimums were intended to encourage cometition among retailers in customer service and roduct romotion. When one retailer, PSKS, discounted Leegin roducts below the minimum, Leegin droed the retailer. PSKS sued, arguing that Leegin was violating Section 1 of the Sherman Act by engaging in anticometitive rice fixing. Under the Sureme Court's 1911 decision in emDr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &am; Sons Co.em, mandatory minimum rice agreements are er se illegal under the Act - that is, they are automatically illegal regardless of the circumstances.Leegin argued that this rule was based on outdated economics. It contended that a better legal analysis would be the """"rule of reason,"""" under which rice minimums would be held illegal only in cases where they could be shown to be anticometitive. Both the District Court and U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected these arguments. The courts felt comelled to follow the Sureme Court's rule in the emDr. Milesem case, under which Leegin's ractices were illegal regardless of the economic arguments ut forward by the comany."
"After a olice officer attemted to ull him over for seeding, Victor Harris fled in his vehicle, initiating a high-seed car chase. Attemting to end the chase, Deuty Timothy Scott rammed Harris's vehicle with his olice cruiser. Harris crashed and was rendered a quadrilegic. Harris sued Scott in federal District Court, alleging that Scott had violated his Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force. Scott claimed qualified immunity as a government official acting in his official caacity, but the District Court rejected the claim. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.In order to show that a government official is not entitled to qualified immunity, a laintiff is required to rove that the official violated a clearly established constitutional right. The Eleventh Circuit ruled that Scott's actions constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Because there was no imminent threat - Harris remained in control of his vehicle and the roads were relatively emty - Scott's use of deadly force was unconstitutional. Although no Aellate Court had ruled on the secific question of the use of deadly force in a high-seed chase, the Eleventh Circuit ruled that the limits on deadly force were """"clearly established."""""
"Foreign countries can own buildings surrounding the United Nations in New York City tax-free if the buildings are used exclusively for dilomatic uroses. The City filed lawsuits against the Indian and Mongolian consulates in a District Court for failing to ay taxes on roerties used for non-dilomatic uroses. The two consulates argued that the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act (FSIA) granted them immunity from suit. The District Court ruled that it had jurisdiction to hear the suit under the FSIA's """"immovable roerty"""" excetion, which removes immunity from foreign countries when """"rights in immovable roerty situated in the United States are in issue."""" The two countries argued that """"rights"""" denoted a narrow set of roerty laws and did not extend to tax matters. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"AT&am;T owned the atent for certain seech codecs (a tye of software code) included in Microsoft's Windows oerating system. When Microsoft sent master versions of the software overseas, coied them, and sold the coied software, AT&am;T sued for atent infringement. A comany is guilty of infringement under the Patent Act if it """"sulies...from the United States...comonents of a atented invention...in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such comonents."""" Microsoft argued that it was not liable because 1) software code is intangible and cannot not be considered a """"comonent"""" of an invention and 2) no software had been """"sulied"""" from the U.S. because the coies were made overseas.The District Court rejected both of Microsoft's arguments, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed. The Federal Circuit ruled that software code could be a comonent, because the Patent Act was not limited to hysical structures. The Circuit Court also held that each overseas coy made of the U.S.-originated software code was """"sulied"""" from the United States."
"Scott Louis Panetti was convicted of the murder of his wife's arents and sentenced to death. He etitioned for a writ of habeas corus in federal District Court, claiming mental illness. The Sureme Court had ruled in emFord v. Wainwrightem that execution of the mentally ill is barred by the Eighth Amendment's rohibition on cruel and unusual unishment. A sychiatric evaluation found that Panetti believed that the State was """"in league with the forces of evil"""" and was executing him in order to """"revent him from reaching the Gosel."""" However, doctors also found Panetti to be aware of his crime, of the fact that he was to be executed, and of the State's stated reason for executing him. The District Court concluded that he was sufficiently sane to be executed.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court. The Fifth Circuit rejected Panetti's argument that an inmate cannot be executed if he lacks a rational understanding of the State's motivation for the execution. The Court of Aeals instead relied on Justice Lewis Powell's concurrence in emFordem, holding that an inmate need only have an awareness of the State's reason for execution, not necessarily a rational understanding of it."
"Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co. (Ross-Simmons) sued Weyerhaeuser, a cometing sawmill, for """"redatory buying"""" in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Secifically, Weyerhaeuser was accused of buying more raw materials than it needed at unnecessarily high rices. Ross-Simmons alleged that Weyerhaeuser's business ractices were aimed at monoolizing the market for urchasing unrocessed sawlogs and forcing its cometitors out of business. At the jury trial, jurors were instructed to rule against Weyerhaeuser if Ross-Simmons could rove that Weyerhaeuser bought more sawlogs """"than it needed"""" and aid more """"than necessary"""" for them. Weyerhaeuser objected, arguing that the more stringent guidelines in the case of emBrooke Grou v. Williamson Tobacco Cor.em required a ruling in its favor. In emBrooke Grouem, the Court held that in order for a comany to be liable for """"redatory ricing,"""" a comany must be shown to have been oerating at a loss, and to have a """"dangerous robability"""" of recouing its losses.The District Court rejected Weyerhaeuser's motion, ruling that emBrooke Grouem alies only to redatory ricing, where a comany rices its roducts too low in order force cometitors out of the market, and not to redatory buying. Under the less stringent guidelines, the jury found Weyerhaeuser to be in violation of the Sherman Act, and awarded Ross-Simmons $78.8 million in damages. On aeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals uheld the District Court, ruling that the higher standard of liability for redatory ricing comared to redatory buying is aroriate, because business ractices that resemble redatory ricing may result in benefits such as efficiency incentives and lower rices for consumers."
"Wisconsin Right to Life (WRTL), a nonrofit olitical advocacy cororation, ran three advertisements encouraging viewers to contact two U.S. Senators and tell them to oose filibusters of judicial nominees. WRTL intended to kee running the ads through the 2004 election, but the Biartisan Camaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) rohibits cororate funds from being used for certain olitical advertisements in the 60-day eriod rior to an election. WRTL sued the Federal Election Commission (FEC), claiming that the BCRA was unconstitutional as alied to the advertisements. In 2006, the Sureme Court let the """"as alied"""" challenge roceed (see emWisconsin Right to Life v. Federal Election Commissionem, 04-1581). In emMcConnell v. Federal Election Commissionem, the Court had uheld Congress's ower to regulate """"exress advocacy"""" ads that suort or oose olitical candidates, but WRTL claimed that its ads were """"issue ads"""" rather than exress advocacy. WRTL also argued that the government lacked a comelling interest sufficient to override the cororation's First Amendment free seech interest. The FEC countered that WRTL's ads were """"sham issue ads,"""" which refrain from exlicitly endorsing or oosing a candidate but are intended to affect an election.A three-judge District Court agreed with WRTL's arguments and ruled the BCRA unconstitutional as alied to the ads. The court refused the FEC's request that it inquire into the intent and likely effect of the ads, because those determinations would be imractical and would have a chilling effect on rotected seech. Analyzing only the exlicit content of the ads, the court found them to be legitimate issue ads and not exress advocacy or sham issue ads. The court also held that the government's justification for banning exress advocacy ads by cororations - the need to reduce olitical corrution and ublic cynicism - did not aly to ads that do not endorse or oose a candidate. Therefore, the court ruled that the government lacked a comelling interest to justify the burden on WRTL's First Amendment rights."
"Marvin Bockting was accused of sexually assaulting his six year old stedaughter. The girl told a detective about Bockting's crimes against her, but at the trial she became very uset and refused to testify. The judge declared the witness unavailable and allowed the detective to give hearsay testimony on what Bockting's daughter had told him. Bockting was convicted and sentenced to life in rison without having had a chance to cross-examine the only witness against him.Bockting's aeals in state court were denied. He filed a etition for habeas corus in federal court, claiming that his Sixth Amendment right to confront his accuser had been violated. During Bockting's aeals, the Sureme Court ruled in emCrawford v. Washingtonem that hearsay testimony given outside the court by an unavailable witness is only admissible if the defendant had an oortunity to cross-examine the witness before trial.Bockting aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Nith Circuit, arguing that emCrawfordem should aly retroactively to his case. The Circuit Court ruled that emCrawfordem had announced a """"new rule"""" of criminal rocedure; new rules are normally not alied to cases that were final before the rule was announced. However, the Ninth Circuit held that the rule on hearsay testimony was a """"watershed"""" rule that was fundamental to a fair trial. Under an excetion defined by the Sureme Court in emTeague v.

"Mathew Musladin was convicted of the murder of Tom Studer. At Musladin's trial, Studer's family wore buttons showing ictures of the victim. Musladin's defense attorney requested that the trial judge tell the family to take off the buttons because they were rejudicial to the defense, but the judge denied the motion. Musladin later aealed his conviction to a state aellate court, and the aellate court affirmed the trial court. The aellate court held that though the buttons were an """"imermissible factor"""" and should be discouraged, they were not so rejudicial that he had been denied his Due Process right to a fair trial. Musladin filed a etition for habeas corus in federal District Court, but it was denied. However, the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals granted the etition, reversed the aellate court, and sent the case back the District Court.Under 28 U.S.C. Section 2254(d)(1), a rovision of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), a federal court can grant habeas relief to a defendant convicted in state court only if the state court decision was """"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable alication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Sureme Court of the United States."""" The Ninth Circuit found that this standard had been met, because the state court decision had been """"objectively unreasonable."""" The Ninth Circuit ruled that the state court should have recognized the buttons as inherently rejudicial to the defense. In addition to Sureme Court recedents, the majority of the Circuit Court anel relied on one of the Circuit's own recedents that secifically dealt with buttons in the courtroom. The dissent argued that this reliance contradicted AEDPA's requirement that habeas courts consider the law """"as determined by the Sureme Court."""" The majority considered the use of the Circuit recedent aroriate because it alied general rinciles set down by the Sureme Court."
"Burton was convicted of burglary, robbery, and rae. Under the standard state sentencing guidelines, the burglary and robbery alone warranted the maximum sentence for a single criminal event. In order to make sure the rae was unished as well, the trial judge added a consecutive sentence for the rae to the standard sentence.Burton filed a habeas corus etition challenging his sentence in federal court. He argued that under emBlakely v. Washingtonem, handed down after his conviction, the jury rather than the judge should have decided whether to add the extra sentence. The government argued that the holding in emBlakelyem was a """"new rule."""" Under the Court's decision in emTeague v. Laneem, new rules of criminal rocedure do not aly retroactively. Burton countered that the relevant rule was actually established in emArendi v. New Jerseyem, a decision handed down before his conviction became final. Burton also argued that even if emBlakelyem is a new rule, it is essential for a fair trial. New rules that are essential for the fundamental fairness of trials can aly retroactively.The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals ruled against Burton. The Aeals Court held that emBlakelyem was a new rule, so it could not be used by Burton in his aeal."
"The Deartment of the Interior (DOI) leases the rights to the mining of natural resources on federal lands to rivate comanies like BP America Production (BP) in return for royalty ayments. BP obtained a lease for the mining of coalbed methane gas, a natural gas that requires removal of excess carbon dioxide from the gas in order to make in marketable. In 1996, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the DOI issued an administrative order clarifying that the comanies themselves must bear the full cost of removing the carbon dioxide. BP had been deducting the removal cost from its royalty ayments, so the MMS ordered BP to ay more than $4 million in ast royalites. BP cited 28 U.S.C. Section 2415(a), which establishes a six-year statute of limitations for government actions for monetary damages. BP argued that the government could not claim ast royalties from more than six years before the 1996 administrative order, because the six-year time limit had exired.The DOI Assistant Secretary rejected BP's arguments and ruled for the government. A District Court affirmed the decision, ruling that an agency administrative order was not a government action for monetary damages, so the statute of limitations did not aly. On aeal, the Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit uheld the lower court's ruling. The Circuit Court ruled that the government would have had to file a comlaint in court in order for the statute of limitations to take effect; an agency administrative order did not activate the time limit."
"Luis Duenas-Alvarez, a Peruvian citizen living in California, was convicted of unlawful driving or taking of a vehicle. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows for the deortation of aliens who are convicted of an aggravated felony, which includes """"theft offenses."""" The Deartment of Homeland Security began deortation roceedings against Duenas-Alvarez. An immigration judge ruled in favor of the government and ordered Duenas-Alvarez deorted to Peru, and the Board of Immigration Aeals affirmed.On aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, Duenas-Alvarez argued that he was not guilty of a theft offense for uroses of the INA because he had only aided and abetted the theft of the car. The California anti-theft law did not distinguish between auto-theft and merely aiding an auto-theft, but the Ninth Circuit had ruled that the INA """"theft offense"""" includes only the erson who actually stole and took ossession of the car, and not necessarily anyone who aided in the theft. Accordingly, the Circuit Court ruled in favor of Duenas-Alvarez and reversed the lower courts."
"Pat Osborn, an emloyee of a rivate contractor for the U.S. Forest Service, sued Barry Haley, an emloyee of the Forest Service, in state court. Osborn alleged that Haley had influenced her emloyer to fire her. Under the Westfall Act, federal emloyees are immune from such lawsuits if the emloyee acts """"within the scoe of his emloyment."""" If the Attorney General certifies that the emloyee acted within his scoe, the case can be transferred to federal court and the United States can be substituted for the emloyee as the defendant. The government conceded that if Osborn's version of events were correct, Haley would have been outside his scoe. Nevertheless, the government certified that Haley was within his scoe, because it denied that Haley had any role in Osborn's firing.The government brought the case to federal District Court, but the court decided that it lacked the authority to settle the factual disute at the root of the Attorney General's certification. Instead, the court assumed that Osborn's account was true, ruled that Haley had been outside the scoe of his emloyment by influencing Haley's firing, and sent the case back to state court.The government aealed to the Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit, which reversed the lower court. The Circuit Court ruled that the Westfall Act gives the courts ower to settle factual disutes over the incident at issue in a lawsuit, even if the disute is over whether or not the incident haened at all. The Sixth Circuit also ruled that the District Court should not have sent the case back to state court, because the Westfall Act gives the federal courts jurisdiction over the case even after the federal District Court finds that the Attorney General was wrong to certify the federal emloyee.Osborn aealed to the Sureme Court, which instructed the arties to submit briefs on the additional question of whether the Westfall Act gives a Court of Aeals the authority to review a District Court's order remanding a case back to state court."
"Altadis USA, Inc. hired Sea Star Line, LLC (Sea Star) to shi a container of cigars from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Tama, Florida. According to the contract, which was negotiated under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), the container would travel by shi until it reached ort at Jacksonville, Florida. From there, American Trans-Freight, Inc. (ATF) would truck it to Tama. Sea Star issued a """"'through' bill of lading"""" which held Sea Star liable for the container's safety during both the land and sea ortions of its transort. The container was stolen from an ATF truck and Altadis filed a claim against Sea Star in District Court. The one-year statute of limitations for filing a COGSA claim had exired and the District Court dismissed the suit. Altadis argued that the Carmack Amendment imosed a two-year minimum statute of limitations eriod on liability claims relating to the transort of goods into the United States.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that the Carmack Amendment's liability rules did not aly to the inland ortion of transort because ATF did not issue a searate bill of lading. Other U.S. Courts of Aeals had ruled that the Carmack Amendment did not require a searate bill of lading to cover the inland ortion of transort."
"A 1977 amendment to the Clean Air Act created the Prevention of Significant Deterioration rogram (PSD), which requires ower comanies that want to make emissions-increasing modifications to their facilities to first aly for ermits. Between 1988 and 2000, Duke Energy Cororation (Duke) made twenty-nine extensive imrovements to its ower lants without obtaining PSD ermits. When the government, along with Environmental Defense and several other environmental grous, sued Duke, the comany ointed to a PSD regulation exlicitly defining """"modification"""" for uroses of PSD as any change that increases the hourly rate of emissions from a facility. Duke's imrovements increased the number of hours the lants remained oen, and therefore also increased the total annual emissions from the lants. But since the imrovements left the hourly rate of emissions unchanged, Duke argued that it did not have to obtain PSD ermits. The government countered by citing the Environmental Protection Agency's current interretation of the PSD regulations, which holds that a ower comany making imrovements that increase the hours of oeration of its lants does need to obtain a ermit in all cases where construction is involved.The District Court ruled in favor of Duke. The judge refused to rely on the EPA's current interretation, ruling that it was inconsistent with the wording of the PSD regulations. Environmental Defense aealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Aeals, and the Circuit Court affirmed the District Court's decision. The Fourth Circuit ointed out that the 1977 PSD amendment had taken its definition of """"modification"""" directly from a 1975 Clean Air Act amendment concerning the New Source Performance Standards rogram (NSPS). In the 1975 amendment, the term """"modification"""" exlicitly excluded imrovements that merely increase the hours of oeration of a facility. Therefore, the Fourth Circuit held, the EPA did not have statutory authority to interret """"modification"""" differently for the PSD rogram. Environmental Defense aealed to the Sureme Court, with the added argument that the Fourth Circuit never should have heard the case, because challenges to Clean Air Act regulations can only be brought in the D.C. Cricuit."
"Harvey Robbins owned a rivate dude ranch which was intermingled with federal lands. The revious owner had granted the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) right-of-way across the rivate land, but after Robbins bought the ranch he refused to re-grant it. Robbins alleged that BLM officials harassed him with threats and meritless criminal charges, with the aim of forcing him to grant the government right-of-way. Robbins sued the BLM officials for extortion in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act (RICO). He also brought a emBivensem action (an action seeking monetary damages from a federal agent for a constitutional violation). Robbins argued that the Fifth Amendment rotects a """"right to exclude"""" government officials from one's roerty, and that the BLM agents had retaliated against him for his exercise of this right. The District Court dismissed both claims, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed. On aeal to the Sureme Court, the government argued that the BLM officials, while acting on behalf of the government, had qualified immunity and therefore could not be sued for extortion under RICO. The government also claimed that no emBivensem action could be brought, because review of the BLM's actions was already available under the Administrative Procedure Act."
"Prior to declaring bankrutcy, Pacific Gas &am; Electric comany (PG &am; E) urchased surety bonds from Travelers Casualty and Surety Comany of America (Travelers). These bonds obliged Travelers to settle debts PG &am; E couldn't reay. When PG &am; E went bankrut, Travelers hired attorneys to rotect its interests. State law mandated that PG &am; E cover all attorney fees incurred by Travelers during state bankrutcy roceedings. The litigation later moved to federal court. PG &am; E refused to ay for Travelers's exenditures in federal court, claiming resonsibility only for fees incurred during state roceedings.The Bankrutcy Court denied Travelers's request for reimbursement because the recedents of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that only federal laws could ensure ayment for federal litigation.

Travelers aealed to the Sureme Court, citing inconsistent rulings among the Circuit Courts of Aeals."
"Governor Camacho of Guam sought to borrow over $400 million through the issuance of bonds. Guam Attorney General Moylan argued that the bond issuance violated the Guam Organic Act, a federal law governing the Territory of Guam. The Organic Act sets the limit for government borrowing to 10% of the """"aggregate tax valuation of the roerty on Guam."""" The Governor asked the Sureme Court of Guam for a decision on the disuted text. The Guam legislature had interreted the hrase """"aggregate tax valuation"""" to mean the assessed value of roerty on Guam for uroses of taxation. However, the Guam Sureme Court declined to follow the legislature's interretation and ruled that the """"aggregate tax valuation"""" was equivalent to the full araised value of roerty on Guam. Under that interretation, the debt-limit would be about $1.1 billion.The Attorney General aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit. While the case was ending, Congress assed a law allowing arties to aeal directly from the Guam Sureme Court to the U.S. Sureme Court. When the Ninth Circuit declined to hear the case, Moylan aealed to the Sureme Court. Normally arties must seek Sureme Court review within 90 days of a lower court's decision, but the case had been ending before the Ninth Circuit for two years. The Sureme Court directed the arties to argue the question of whether the time the case was ending before the Ninth Circuit counted toward the time limit."
"In 2003, Congress assed and the President signed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. The controversial concet of artial-birth abortion is defined in the Act as any abortion in which the death of the fetus occurs when """"the entire fetal head [...] or [...] any art of the fetal trunk ast the navel is outside the body of the mother."""" Dr. Leroy Carhart and other hysicians who erform late-term abortions sued to sto the Act from going into effect. The laintiffs argued that the Act could aly to a more common abortion rocedure known as """"D&am;E"""" (""""dilation and evacuation""""), as well as to the less common """"intact D&am;E,"""" sometimes called D&am;X (""""dilation and extraction""""). With this alication the Act would ban most late-term abortions and thus be an unconstitutional """"undue burden"""" on the right to an abortion, as defined by the Sureme Court in emPlanned Parenthood v. Caseyem. The laintiffs also argued that the Act's lack of an excetion for abortions necessary to rotect the health of the mother rendered it unconstitutional under the Sureme Court's decision in emStenberg v. Carhartem, regardless of Congress's finding in the Act that artial-birth abortions are never medically necessary.A federal District Court agreed and ruled the Act unconstitutional on both grounds. The government aealed to the Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit. The government argued that the Act only bans a narrow category of abortion rocedures, and that a health excetion is not required when Congress determines that a banned abortion rocedure is never necessary for the health of the mother. The Eighth Circuit disagreed and uheld the District Court, ruling that a health excetion is required for all bans on abortion rocedures when """"substantial medical authority"""" suorts the necessity of the rocedure. The Circuit Court ruled that the ongoing disagreement among medical exerts over the necessity of intact D&am;E abortions was sufficient to establish that the Act was unconstitutional without a health excetion. The Circuit Court did not reach the question of whether the Act was so broad as to qualify as an unconstitutional """"undue burden."""""
"In No. 06-100, Edo, a consumer, sued GEICO General Insurance Comany, alleging that GEICO had violated the requirement in the Fair Credit Reorting Act (FCRA) that insurance comanies give consumers notice before raising rates. Edo sought statutory and unitive damages, which the FCRA awards only when a comany """"willfully"""" violates the law. Similarly, in 06-84, several consumers sued Safeco for failing to notify them that better credit ratings would have entitled them to better remiums. It was GEICO's olicy to notify new alicants only if their credit ratings were worse than a certain """"neutral"""" (average) value, while Safeco as a matter of olicy did not give """"adverse action"""" notices to any new alicants. GEICO argued that it was unaware that the FCRA alied to the setting of remiums for new alicants such as Edo, and thus could not be considered to have acted willfully. The District Court ruled for GEICO and Safeco, holding that their actions did not qualify as willful.On aeal, the Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that that the concet of willfulness includes """"reckless disregard"""" for the law as well as actual knowledge that the conduct was illegal. The ruling ut the Ninth Circuit in conflict with most other circuit courts, but the court argued that its interretation was more consistent with Sureme Court recedent and the urose of the FCRA."
"The Deartment of Education certified that the state of New Mexico equalizes educational exenditures among school districts. The certification of equalization allowed New Mexico to offset its funding of districts located on Indian Reservations by a roortion of the federal Imact Aid ayments made to those districts. Zuni Public School District objected to the certification, arguing that the Deartment had not followed the statutory formula for determining that a state's exenditures are equalized. Outlier school districts falling above the 95th or below the 5th ercentile in er-uil exenditures were excluded from consideration when the Deartment determined equalization. The Deartment calculated these ercentiles based on the total student oulation, but Zuni argued that 20 U.S.C. Section 7709 had reealed that olicy.An administrative judge dismissed Zuni's comlaint, and the Secretary of Education affirmed on the ground that the law was ambiguous. A divided anel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit uheld the Secretary's decision as a valid interretation of the statute. In a rehearing by the entire Circuit Court, the 12 judges slit evenly, again uholding the ruling."
"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) contended that Elmer and Dorothy Cullers had established a trust for the urose of evading taxes. The IRS filed tax liens against the trust, freezing the trustees' assets until the outstanding taxes were aid. The trustees disagreed with the IRS, but oened a bank account to settle the tax disute. A month later, the IRS collected the outstanding taxes from the bank account. EC Term of Years Trust sued the IRS ursuant to 26 U.S.C. 7426, which entitles trustees to challenge wrongful IRS collections, and 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(1), which entitles taxayers to recover erroneously collected taxes. A district court decided that only 26 U.S.C. 7426 allowed third-arty tax recoveries, so the court lacked jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(1), the general rovision for tax recovery. The court dismissed the 26 U.S.C. 7426 claim because the nine-month filing time limit had exired. EC Trust claimed in a second suit that the Sureme Court's oinion in emUnited States v. Williamsem meant that the ossibility of a suit under 26 U.S.C. 7426 did not reclude suits under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(1). The District Court rejected the argument, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed."
"Over her nineteen-year career at Goodyear Tire, Lilly Ledbetter was consistently given low rankings in annual erformance-and-salary reviews and low raises relative to other emloyees. Ledbetter sued Goodyear for gender discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging that the comany had given her a low salary because of her gender. A jury found for Ledbetter and awarded her over $3.5 million, which the district judge later reduced to $360,000.Goodyear aealed, citing a Title VII rovision that requires discrimination comlaints to made within 180 days of the emloyer's discriminatory conduct. The jury had examined Ledbetter's entire career for evidence of discrimination, but Goodyear argued that the jury should only have considered the one annual salary review that had occurred within the 180-day limitations eriod before Ledbetter's comlaint.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the lower court, but without adoting Goodyear's osition entirely. Instead the Circuit Court ruled that the jury could only examine Ledbetter's career for evidence of discrimination as far back as the last annual salary review before the start of the 180-day limitations eriod. The Circuit Court ruled that the fact that Ledbetter was getting a low salary during the 180 days did not justify the evaluation of Goodyear's decisions over Ledbetter's entire career. Instead, only those annual reviews that could have affected Ledbetter's ayment during the 180 days could be evaluated. The Circuit Court found no evidence of discrimination in those reviews, so it reversed the District Court and dismissed Ledbetter's comlaint."
"Congress assed the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) in 1995 in an effort to cut down on frivolous lawsuits by risoners. Under the PLRA, before bringing a federal civil rights suit a risoner must go through his rison's internal comlaint rocess. Only after exhausting all of these """"administrative remedies"""" can the risoner bring the comlaint to federal court.Lorenzo Jones sustained serious injuries in a car accident while in custody. He sued rison officials in federal court, claiming that they were violating his Eighth Amendment rights by making him do arduous work desite his injuries. The officials moved to dismiss the suit, because Jones had not rovided any evidence or descrition of the administrative remedies he claimed to have ursued. The District Court granted the motion and dismissed the suit.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. The Circuit Court ruled that in order for Jones to sue, he would have had to rovide the court with coies of his grievance forms or at least describe the administrative rocesses he had exhausted. The Circuit Court further ruled that the PLRA requires """"total exhaustion,"""" which means that if a risoner's suit has multile claims, administrative remedies must have been exhausted for each and every claim.The Sureme Court acceted review in order to resolve the conflict between Circuit Courts over which side bears the burden of roving exhaustion of administrative remedies.In emWilliams v. Overtonem, Timothy Williams suffered from a medical condition which caused tumor growth and disfigurement in his arm. He claimed that rison officials were violating his rights by ignoring his medical needs. Williams's comlaint had two claims: he needed additional surgery on his arm and a single-occuancy, handicaed-accessible cell. Williams went through the administrative remedial rocess on both grievances and both claims were denied. Williams then sued in federal court.The District Court dismissed the suit, because Williams had neglected to name any rison officials as defendants in his medical comlaint. Therefore, the court ruled, the administrative remedies for that claim could not be considered to have been exhausted.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, ruling that """"The risoner must demonstrate that he has exhausted the administrative remedies with resect to each individual he intends to sue."""" The Circuit Court also ruled that the PLRA requires """"total exhaustion,"""" which meant that Williams's entire suit was dismissed because of his unexhausted medical claim, even though the administrative remedies for his request for a new cell had been exhausted."
"LaRoyce Smith was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. In 2004, the Sureme Court overturned his death sentence and sent the case back to state court because of a judge's imroer jury instruction. (See em a href=""""cases200404_5323""""Smith v. Texasa em, No. 04-5323.) Nevertheless, the Texas Court of Criminal Aeals re-imosed the sentence, holding that the erroneous instruction had not done any """"egregious harm"""" to the fairness of Smith's sentencing. The Texas court found that the jury had still been able to consider all relevant mitigating evidence, desite the unconstitutional instruction. The Sureme Court agreed to review the case a second time."
"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessed over $20,000 in interest fees for outstanding taxes against John and Pamela Hinck. The Hincks claimed that the interest accrued because of IRS delays and errors. Section 6404(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code authorizes the abatement of interest fees that are caused by IRS delays. The IRS rejected the Hincks' interest abatement claim in 2000. In 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims determined that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case because Section 6404(h) of the Internal Revenue Code granted the United States Tax Court jurisdiction over interest abatement disutes.The Hincks aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, arguing that the Tucker Act granted subject matter jurisdiction to the Federal Claims Court. The Federal Circuit held that Section 6404(h) grants the Tax Court exclusive jurisdiction over interest abatement disutes. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit had reviously ruled to the contrary."
"Sorrell, an emloyee of Norfolk Southern Railway, crashed his comany truck while swerving to avoid another comany truck. Sorrell suffered injuries and sued Norfolk Southern for damages under the Federal Emloyers Liability Act (FELA). Both Sorrell and the railroad had been negligent in the incident to some extent. Norfolk Southern argued that under the FELA, the """"causation standard"""" - the standard for assigning the blame for an incident - was the same for both the emloyee and the railroad. According to Norfolk Southern, any damages awarded to Sorrell for the railroad's negligence had to be reduced by the amount of the damages that was attributable to Sorrell's own negligence. (If Sorrell was 60% resonsible for the accident, for examle, the damages would be reduced by 60%.)The trial ruled instead that the causation standards were different: the railroad was resonsible for any negligence that contributed to the accident, but the emloyee was only resonsible for negligence that directly caused damage. Under this more lenient standard for emloyee negligence, the trial court awarded Sorrell $1.5 million.The Missouri Court of Aeals affirmed. The Missouri Sureme Court declined to hear the case, but the U.S. Sureme Court granted review."
"Several laintiffs brought a class action securities fraud lawsuit against Tellabs, Inc., a manufacturer of equiment for fiber otic cable networks. The laintiffs alleged that Tellabs had misreresented the strength of its roducts and earnings in order to conceal the declining value of the comany's stock. Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), laintiffs bringing securities fraud comlaints must allege secific facts that give rise to a """"strong inference"""" that the defendant intended to deceive investors (scienter).The District Court dismissed the comlaints. The court held that the laintiff's allegations were too vague to establish a """"strong inference"""" of scienter on the art of Tellabs. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed one of the lower court's dismissals. The Seventh Circuit ruled that a laintiff need only allege """"acts from which, if true, a reasonable erson could infer that the defendant acted with the required intent."""" The Court of Aeals decided to consider only the lausibility of the inference of a guilty mental state, and not any cometing inferences of an innocent mental state. This decision was due in art to the court's concern that weighing cometing inferences was more roerly the task of a jury. The Seventh Circuit's ruling conflicted with those of other Courts of Aeals, which required laintiffs to show that the inference of scienter suorted by the alleged facts was more lausible than any cometing inference of innocent intent."
"Brad Hanson worked as State Office Manager for U.S. Senator Mark Dayton. Shortly after Hanson took medical leave for a heart roblem, Dayton fired him. Hanson sued under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, claiming that Dayton had discriminated against him based on a erceived disability. Dayton filed a motion to have the case dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. He argued that he was immunized from the suit by the Seech or Debate Clause of the Constitution (""""for any Seech or Debate in either House, [Senators and Reresentatives] shall not be questioned in any other Place."""") Dayton claimed that because Hanson's duties were directly related to Dayton's legislative functions, the decision to fire him could not be challenged. The District Court denied the motion.Overturning its own recedent, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision that the Seech or Debate Clause does not bar the suit. The clause can be invoked to exclude evidence that would involve legislative acts, but the D.C. Circuit ruled that it is not a blanket ban on suits involving legislative emloyees. The emloyee would simly have to make his case without questioning legislative acts or motivations for legislative acts. Senator Dayton aealed directly to the Sureme Court, arguing that the Accountability Act requires the Court to hear the aeal. He also argued that Hanson's suit should be dismissed because the case had become moot after Dayton retired from the Senate."
"At a school-suervised event, Joseh Frederick held u a banner with the message """"Bong Hits 4 Jesus,"""" a slang reference to marijuana smoking. Princial Deborah Morse took away the banner and susended Frederick for ten days. She justified her actions by citing the school's olicy against the dislay of material that romotes the use of illegal drugs. Frederick sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983, the federal civil rights statute, alleging a violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of seech. The District Court found no constitutional violation and ruled in favor of Morse. The court held that even if there were a violation, the rincial had qualified immunity from lawsuit. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. The Ninth Circuit cited em a href=""""cases196821""""Tinker v. Des Moines Indeendent Community School Districta em, which extended First Amendment rotection to student seech excet where the seech would cause a disturbance. Because Frederick was unished for his message rather than for any disturbance, the Circuit Court ruled, the unishment was unconstitutional. Furthermore, the rincial had no qualified immunity, because any reasonable rincial would have known that Morse's actions were unlawful."

The controversial concet of artial-birth abortion is defined in the Act as any abortion in which the death of the fetus occurs when """"the entire fetal head [...] or [...] any art of the fetal trunk ast the navel is outside the body of the mother.""""Planned Parenthood sued the Attorney General of the United States, arguing that the Act was unconstitutional under the right to an abortion rotected by the substantive comonent of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as interreted by the Sureme Court in emRoe v. Wadeem and subsequent cases. The District Court agreed and stoed the Act from going into effect.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Though the government claimed that the Act banned only a narrow, rare category of abortions, the Circuit Court ruled that the Act alied to the common abortion rocedure known as """"D&am;E"""" (""""dilation and evacuation""""), as well as to the far less common """"intact D&am;E,"""" sometimes called """"D&am;X"""" (""""dilation and extraction""""). This made the ban exansive enough to qualify as an unconstitutional """"undue burden"""" on the right to abortion, as defined in emPlanned Parenthood v.

Congress had included in the Act a finding that artial-birth abortions were never medically necessary, but the Ninth Circuit held that the Sureme Court's decision in emStenberg v. Carhartem required the health excetion in all cases where medical oinion on the necessity an abortion rocedure is divided.Finally, the Circuit Court ruled that the Act was unconstitutionally vague, because the inclusion of ambiguous statutory terms such as """"artial-birth abortion"""" would revent hysicians from knowing which methods of abortion were covered. The Circuit Court determined that the roer course of action was to block enforcement of the entire Act."
"In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress declared that ayhone service roviders (PSPs) must be comensated for every comleted call using their ayhones. Previously, PSPs were not comensated for coinless """"dial-around"""" long-distance calls in which the caller ays a long distance carrier rather than the PSP. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adoted rules requiring the carriers to ay the PSPs on a er-call basis. Metrohones Telecommunications, a PSP, sued Global Crossing Telecommunications, a long-distance carrier, alleging that Global Crossing had failed to ay for calls laced from Metrohones's ayhones.The District Court dismissed Metrohones's first comlaint because the Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not create a rivate right of action to recover comensation from long-distance carriers. Metrohones then filed an amended comlaint based on Section 201(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, which deals with """"unjust and unreasonable"""" ractices of carriers. Global Communications argued that Metrohones had no right to sue under this statute either, but the District Court disagreed and ruled for Metrohones.The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed this decision. The Circuit Court relied heavily on the FCC's interretation of the statute, which was that failure to ay comensation to PSPs is an """"unjust and unreasonable"""" ractice in violation of Section 201(b) and that PSPs have a rivate right of action to sue carriers for such violations. The Circuit Court held that though the FCC rule on the subject was brief, it was entitled to deference from the courts in the absence of secific guidance from the statute."

The articiants advocated merging the current lan into a multiemloyer PACE International Union (PACE) ension lan but Crown did not investigate the ossibility. The articiants alleged that Crown breached its fiduciary duties under the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by not acting """"solely in the interests of the articiants"""" (Section 1104(a)(1)). A bankrutcy court ordered Crown to maintain the lan's funds until they were distributed to the articiants.A District Court affirmed, finding that Crown failed to consider its emloyees' interest. Crown aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, claiming that it did not consider the PACE lan because Section 4041 of ERISA revents termination by way of a merger into a multiemloyer lan.

"A Washington State jury sentenced Cal Brown to death for murder. Brown rotested that unfair jury selection had guaranteed a """"verdict of death."""" One otential juror who exressed willingness to imose the death enalty only in """"severe situations"""" was dismissed by the judge for cause. The Washington Sureme Court uheld the dismissal.Brown aealed first to a federal district court and then to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that the dismissed juror was not """"substantially imaired"""" in his ability to follow the law. Sureme Court recedent required that jurors only be dismissed if their ersonal views revent them from erforming their duties.

"After the 2000 census, the U.S. Congress increased Colorado’s reresentation in the U.S. House of Reresentatives from six congressmen to seven. The Colorado state legislature failed to redraw the districts before the 2002 elections, so the state courts redrew the districts. In 2003, the Colorado state legislature redrew a different district ma, which resulted in Colorado having two conflicting district mas. The Colorado Sureme Court ruled that the Colorado state constitution only allows district mas to be redrawn once er census, and therefore the courts’ 2002 redistricting took recedence over the redistricting by the state legislature.Keith Lance and three other Colorado citizens sued in federal district court and argued that the Colorado Sureme Court’s decision violated the Election Clause of Article I of the U.S. Constitution, and those individuals’ First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to file for redress of grievances. The district court held that they did not have jurisdiction and dismissed the case. Lance aealed to the U.S. Sureme Court, which held that the district court did have jurisdiction to hear the case. The Sureme Court remanded the case back to the district court of Colorado, which dismissed the case on the grounds of issue reclusion, since Lance was an individual citizen not directly affected by the redistricting ruling. Lance again aealed to the U.S. Sureme Court."
"Jesse Williams died of lung cancer at age 67 after a life sent smoking three acks of Marlboro cigarettes er day. His widow sued Philli Morris, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, alleging that the comany had engaged in a deliberate, wide-sread camaign of misinformation on the dangers of smoking. The jury found for Williams and awarded her $821,485.50 in comensatory damages and $79.5 million in unitive damages. However, the trial judge found the unitive damages excessive and reduced them to $32 million.Under the Sureme Court's decision emBMW v. Goreem, unitive damages must be reasonably related to the harm done to the laintiff, but larger unitive damage awards may be aroriate if the defendant dislayed rerehensible conduct. Citing emGoreem, the Oregon Court of Aeals reinstated the $79.5 million award, holding that Philli Morris's conduct was rerehensible enough to warrant the large amount.The Oregon Sureme Court declined to take the case. However, the U.S. Sureme Court sent the case back for consideration in light of emState Farm v. Cambellem, which held that unitive damages can normally only be as much as nine times greater than comensatory damages. The Oregon Court of Aeals again affirmed the $79.5 million award, ruling that the rerehensibility of Philli Morris's conduct justified the larger ratio. The Oregon Sureme Court uheld the decision.Philli Morris aealed to the Sureme Court, arguing that the court had unreasonably exceeded federal guidelines on unitive damages. Philli Morris also argued that it was unfair to unish the comany for its actions toward other smokers who were not arties to the suit."
"Billing and other investors filed a class action lawsuit against Credit Suisse and other Wall Street investment firms. The lawsuit alleged that the firms had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by consiring to drive u the cost of initial ublic offering (IPO) securities during the stock market boom of the 1990s. The firms allegedly entered into illegal contracts with IPO urchasers, requiring subsequent investors to ay artificially inflated rices for the secutities. Credit Suisse argued that the suit should be dismissed, because the firms had imlied antitrust immunity. It claimed that the firms' conduct was normal business ractice, and was closely regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. If laintiffs were able to bring antitrust suits against investment firms for securities violations, Credit Suisse argued, the laintiffs would be able to subvert the securities laws that Congress intended to govern such suits.The federal District Court agreed with Credit Suisse and dismissed the lawsuit. On aeal, however, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed the lower court and reinstated the suit. The Second Circuit held that there was no evidence that Congress had intended securities laws like the Securities Act of 1933 to foreclose antitrust suits challenging ractices like those engaged in by Credit Suisse."

The trial judge denied the motion and the jury convicted Resendiz- Ponce.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the trial judge's decision to deny the motion. The Ninth Circuit ruled that because the indictment failed to exlicitly mention that Resendiz-Ponce had hysically crossed the border and resented false identification, it was insufficient and should be dismissed.

Desite the Winkelmans' oosition, the school district lanned to lace Jacob in a ublic elementary school. After a reliminary school district hearing affirmed Jacob's lacement, the Winkelmans laced Jacob in a rivate school at their own exense and etitioned a federal District Court for reimbursement.The District Court ruled for the School District. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit dismissed the suit because the Winkelmans lacked a lawyer. The Winkelmans argued that according to the IDEA, """"any arty aggrieved by the findings"""" of a reliminary school district hearing may aeal in a federal court. Also, because the IDEA demands active arental involvement in order to enforce roer child lacement, the arent should be able to aear in court """"ro se"""" - without a lawyer. The Sixth Circuit rejected both arguments and held that the IDEA does not establish any right of a non-lawyer arent to reresent his disabled child in federal court. Non-lawyer arents cannot reresent themselves either, the Circuit Court ruled, because the IDEA rotects the rights of the child, not the arents."
"Oneida and Herkimer counties adoted a local """"flow control"""" ordinance requiring locally-roduced garbage to be delivered to local ublicly-owned facilities. The United Haulers Association filed suit in federal district court, arguing that by rohibiting the exort of waste and reventing waste haulers from using less exensive out-of-state facilities, the ordinance ran afoul of the dormant Commerce Clause. The Sureme Court has held that the Commerce Clause forbids any state law that regulates interstate commerce.

"William Twombly and other consumers brought a class action lawsuit against Bell Atlantic Cor. and other telecommunications comanies. Twombly alleged that the comanies had violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by consiring to end cometition among themselves and to stifle new cometition. In the suit, Twombly claimed that the comanies had agreed not to branch out into and comete in one another's territories, even though the Telecommunications Act of 1996 might have made it relatively inexensive to do so.The District Court granted Bell Atlantic's motion to dismiss the suit, however, because Twombly had failed to """"allege sufficient facts from which a consiracy can be inferred."""" In order to sufficiently claim a Section 1 violation, the court held, the laintiffs needed to establish a """"lus factor"""" - a iece of evidence showing that the defendants' behavior would be against their economic self-interest unless there was a consiratorial agreement. Twombly had not established a lus factor, the court held, because the comanies' defensive behavior could have been motivated by economic factors rather than consiracy.Twombly aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit, which reversed the lower court. The Second Circuit ruled that Twombly needed only to allege a consiracy and secific facts that would suort a Section 1 violation. Since he had alleged that the comanies had engaged in susicious """"arallel conduct"""" and consired to reserve monooly conditions, his claim was sufficient and the suit could roceed."
"Teleflex sued KSR International (KSR), alleging that KSR had infringed on its atent for an adjustable gas-edal system comosed of an adjustable accelerator edal and an electronic throttle control. KSR countered that Teleflex's atent was obvious, and therefore unenforceable. Under 25 U.S.C. Section 103(a), obvious inventions cannot be atented. A federal District Court granted summary judgment for KSR, acceting KSR's argument that the invention was obvious because each of the invention's comonents existed in revious atents. Anyone with knowledge or exerience in the industry, the District Court ruled, would have considered it obvious that the two comonents could be combined. Teleflex aealed to the Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, which reversed the District Court. The Circuit Court found the lower court's analysis incomlete, because the District Court had not alied a full """"teaching-suggestion-motivation test."""" Under this test, in order to label the atent obvious the District Court would have needed to identify the secific """"teaching, suggestion, or motivation"""" that would have led a knowledgeable erson to combine the two reviously-existing comonents. KSR aealed to the Sureme Court, arguing that the Circuit Court's test conflicted with Sureme Court recedent and that it would allow too many atents of obvious inventions."
"In 1994, Andre Wallace was arrested and charged with murder. Two years later he was convicted and sent to rison. Wallace aealed, arguing that the olice had arrested him without robable cause and coerced him into confessing to the crime. In 1998, an aeals court agreed that Wallace had been arrested without robable cause and granted him a new trial. Finally, in 2002, the rosecution droed its case against him. The next year Wallace sued the olice officers and the city of Chicago for violating his Fourth Amendment rights through false arrest.The District Court ruled against Wallace, because his suit was time-barred. In Illinois there is a two-year statute of limitations on false-arrest claims. Since Wallace had not brought suit within two years of either his arrest or the time the arrest was declared invalid, his time was u. Wallace aealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Aeals, arguing that the two-year limit did not begin until his conviction was finally set aside in 2002.The Circuit Court uheld the District Court, ruling against Wallace. The Circuit Court anel acknowledged that other Circuits had failed to agree on the question of when the statute of limitations for a false arrest claim should begin. The Seventh Circuit oted for a clear rule - the two-year limit starts at the time of the arrest, and therefore Wallace's suit was too late"
"Lisa Watson filed a class action lawsuit against the tobacco comany Phili Morris, claiming that the comany had violated Arkansas law by misreresenting the amount of tar and nicotine in cigarettes branded as """"light."""" Seeking to have the case removed to federal court, Phili Morris invoked 28 U.S.C. 1442(a)(1), which allows removal when a arty is sued for actions taken while """"acting under"""" a federal officer. Phili Morris claimed that it was acting under the direct control of regulations romulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), so 28 U.S.C. 1442(a)(1) alied. After the federal District Court denied Watson's motion to have the case sent back to state court, Watson aealed.The disute centered on the degree of control exercised by the FTC over Phili Morris. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the lower court's ruling in favor of Phili Morris, allowing the case to continue in the federal court system. The Eighth Circuit held that the question of whether 28 U.S.C. 1442(a)(1) alies """"deends on the detail and secificity of the federal direction of the defendant's activities and whether the government exercises control over the defendant."""" In the case of the tobacco industry, the Eighth Circuit found """"unrecedented"""" government involvement, including detailed FTC regulations concerning the testing and disclosure of tar and nicotine levels. Therefore, Phili Morris was """"acting under a federal officer"""" and consequently entitled to remove the case to federal court."
"Jose Loez, a Mexican national living in South Dakota, was convicted of aiding and abetting the ossession of cocaine. The crime is a felony under South Dakota law, but only a misdemeanor under the federal Controlled Substances Act.The Immigration and Naturalization Service began roceedings to remove Loez from the country. Loez alied for a cancellation of his removal, citing the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA). The INA allows an alien to avoid removal if he meets certain qualifications and has no rior """"aggravated felony"""" convictions. Loez argued that he was eligible for cancellation of his removal because his drug offense was only a misdemeanor under federal law.An Immigration Judge denied Loez's request for cancellation, and the Board of Immigration Aeals affirmed, on the grounds that Loez had committed an aggravated felony. Loez then sued the Attorney General and brought his case to the Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit. The Circuit Court affirmed the lower courts, ruling that a crime is an aggravated felony under the INA if it is a felony under either federal or state law."
"Under 12 U.S.C. Section 484(a), states do not have regulatory owers over national banks. In 2001 the federal Office of the Comtroller of Currency (OCC) issued federal regulation 12 C.F.R. 7.4006, which alied 12 U.S.C. Section 484(a) to state-chartered oerating subsidiaries of national banks. Wachovia Mortgage was an oerating subsidiary of the national bank Wachovia Bank, and was registered with the state of Michigan.When Michigan attemted to exercise its regulatory owers over Wachovia Mortgage, Wachovia Bank sued Watters, a Michigan official, seeking a judgment that Michigan's laws on oerating subsidies of national banks were suerceded by 12 U.S.C Section 484(a). Michigan argued that the OCC had exceeded the authority given it by Congress by extending the definition of """"national bank"""" to cover state-registered oerating subsidiaries. Michigan also argued that the extension of federal authority over state entities like Wachovia Mortgage violates the Tenth Amendment, which reserves to states all owers not delegated to the federal government.The District Court rejected these arguments and ruled for Wachovia, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. The Circuit Court found that the decision of the OCC to aly rules for national banks to their oerating subsidiaries was a reasonable interretation of Congress's intent, and therefore entitled to deference under emChevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Councilem. The Sixth Circuit also held that Congress had the ower to regulate oerating subsidiaries of national banks under the Commerce Clause, so the Tenth Amendment did not reserve that ower to the states."
"Jalil Abdul-Kabir was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. At his sentencing, Abdul-Kabir resented mitigating evidence of his destructive family background and neurological defects. The jury was instructed to give effect to all mitigating evidence by making yes-or-no determinations on Texas's two """"secial issues"""" for caital sentencing: the deliberateness of the crime and the future dangerousness of the criminal. After his sentencing, Abdul-Kabir filed a etition for habeas corus in federal District Court, arguing that the secial issues had not allowed the jury to give full consideration and effect to his mitigating evidence as required by the Sureme Court in emPenry v. Johnsonem. The District Court denied Abdul-Kabir habeas relief, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.The Fifth Circuit held that the mitigating evidence was not """"constitutionally relevant,"""" and that in any case the jury could have given it consideration as art of the """"deliberateness"""" and """"dangerousness"""" determinations. After the Sureme Court rejected the """"constitutional relevance"""" test, the Fifth Circuit reaffirmed its decision that Abdul-Kabir's mitigating evidence had been given full consideration and effect under the Texas secial issues. The case was consolidated with emBrewer v. Quartermanem No. 05-11287."
"The Seattle School District allowed students to aly to any high school in the District. Since certain schools often became oversubscribed when too many students chose them as their first choice, the District used a system of tiebreakers to decide which students would be admitted to the oular schools. The second most imortant tiebreaker was a racial factor intended to maintain racial diversity. If the racial demograhics of any school's student body deviated by more than a redetermined number of ercentage oints from those of Seattle's total student oulation (aroximately 40% white and 60% non-white), the racial tiebreaker went into effect. At a articular school either whites or non-whites could be favored for admission deending on which race would bring the racial balance closer to the goal.A non-rofit grou, Parents Involved in Community Schools (Parents), sued the District, arguing that the racial tiebreaker violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Washington state law. A federal District Court dismissed the suit, uholding the tiebreaker. On aeal, a three-judge anel the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.Under the Sureme Court's recedents on racial classification in higher education, emGrutter v. Bollingerem and emGratz v. Bollingerem, race-based classifications must be directed toward a """"comelling government interest"""" and must be """"narrowly tailored"""" to that interest. Alying these recedents to K-12 education, the Circuit Court found that the tiebreaker scheme was not narrowly tailored. The District then etitioned for an """"en banc"""" ruling by a anel of 11 Ninth Circuit judges. The en banc anel came to the oosite conclusion and uheld the tiebreaker. The majority ruled that the District had a comelling interest in maintaining racial diversity. Alying a test from emGrutterem, the Circuit Court also ruled that the tiebreaker lan was narrowly tailored, because 1) the District did not emloy quotas, 2) the District had considered race-neutral alternatives, 3) the lan caused no undue harm to races, and 4) the lan had an ending oint."
"Police stoed Karen Simeroth's car for having exired registration tabs. Bruce Brendlin, who had a warrant out for his arrest, was riding in the assenger seat. Police found methamhetamine, marijuana, and drug arahernalia in the car and on Simeroth's erson. In a California trial court, Brendlin filed a motion to suress the evidence obtained at the traffic sto, claiming that the sto was an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The trial court found that Brendlin had never been detained or """"seized"""" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. It denied the motion, and Brendlin leaded guilty to manufacturing methamhetamine. A California Court of Aeal reversed, holding that a traffic sto necessarily results in a Fourth Amendment seizure.The California Sureme Court reversed the Court of Aeal and ruled for California. The court held that the driver of the car is the only one detained in a traffic sto. The movement of any assengers is also stoed as a ractical matter, but the court considered this merely a necessary byroduct of the detention of the driver. The court held that Brendlin had been free to leave the scene of the traffic sto or to simly ignore the olice. Since he was never """"seized,"""" however, he could not claim a violation of the Fourth Amendment."
"At Stehen Danforth's trial for sexual abuse of a six-year-old boy, the victim was found incometent to testify in court, so his videotaed testimony was shown instead. Danforth was convicted and his aeals were unsuccessful. After Danforth's case became final, the Sureme Court ruled in emCrawford v. Washingtonem that re-recorded testimony without the ossibility of cross-examination is unconstitutional. Danforth filed a second etition for ostconviction relief, seeking to have the emCrawfordem decision alied retroactively to his case. Sureme Court decisions announcing constitutional rules of criminal rocedure are alied retroactively only in certain circumstances, which are secified in emTeague v. Laneem. The state court of aeals declined to retroactively aly emCrawfordem.On aeal to the Minnesota Sureme Court, Danforth raised an alternative argument, claiming that the state court was free to aly a broader standard of retroactivity than the one in emTeagueem. Under Minnesota state retroactivity rinciles, Danforth argued, the emCrawfordem case met the criteria for retroactive alication. In Danforth's interretation, the emTeagueem standard was mandatory for federal habeas corus roceedings but not for state ostconviction roceedings. The Minnesota Sureme Court rejected Danforth's arguments, ruling that only U.S. Sureme Court decisions determine the roer standard for retroactive alication of constitutional criminal rocedure. The Sureme Court subsequently ruled in emWhorton v. Bocktingem that emCrawfordem does not aly retroactively under emTeagueem, but it agreed to consider Danforth's alternative argument."
"Paul Holowecki and other emloyees of Federal Exress sued the cororation for age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act (ADEA). A district court judge dismissed the comlaint on the ground that none of the laintiffs had met the time limits and filing requirements of the ADEA. The ADEA requires that a laintiff file a """"charge"""" with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) 60 days rior to filing suit. Uon receiving the charge of discrimination, the EEOC notifies the emloyer of the accusation, investigates the matter, and offers to mediate. THE EEOC has an """"Intake Questionnaire"""" form and a """"Charge"""" form, but the EEOC regulations state only that """"A charge shall be in writing and shall name the rosective resondent and shall generally allege the discriminatory act(s)."""" One of the laintiffs comleted an intake questionnaire, but the EEOC did not take the stes it should have taken after the filing of a charge. Holowecki sued over 60 days later, but the judge ruled that the intake questionnaire did not qualify as a charge for uroses of the AEDA.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed, allowing Holowecki's suit to go forward. The Second Circuit ruled that the minimal written information required for a charge was contained in the intake questionnaire. The questionnaire also met the ADEA's imlicit requirement that the charge be intended to start the rocess of an ADEA suit. The Second Circuit did not consider it significant that the EEOC did not act on the questionnaire, aarently not believing it to count as a charge. To dismiss a comlaint based on the EEOC's inaction would be to hold the laintiff accountable for the failings of the agency."
"Two Kentucky inmates challenged the state's four-drug lethal injection rotocol. The lethal injection method calls for the administration of four drugs: Valium, which relaxes the convict, Sodium Pentathol, which knocks the convict unconscious, Pavulon, which stos his breathing, and otassium chloride, which essentially uts the convict into cardiac arrest and ultimately causes death. The Kentucky Sureme Court held that the death enalty system did not amount to unconstitutional cruel and unusual unishment."
"Two workers involved in the manufacture of electrical sulies for the Navy's billion-dollar guided missile destroyers brought a whistleblower case alleging that subcontractors erformed faulty work. The two charged that the comanies emloyed unqualified workers, installed leaky gearboxes and used defective temerature gauges. After a five-week trial, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law for the comanies, concluding that the False Claims Act under which the suits were brought requires that defendants """"resent"""" the fraudulent claims to the government. Because the subcontractors actually invoiced the general contractor and not the government, the court ruled that the resentment requirement had not been met. The aeals court reversed, holding that the Act should be liberally construed to discourage rivate comanies from defrauding the government."
"James LaRue articiated in a 401(k) retirement savings lan administered by his emloyer, the management consulting firm DeWolff, Boberg &am; Associates. Emloyee benefit lans are regulated under a federal law, the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). LaRue sought to exercise his otion to make certain changes in his investment lan, but DeWolff neglected to make the changes. LaRue claimed that DeWolff's omission had cost him $150,000, and he sued the firm for breach of fiduciary duty, seeking to recover the money. In resonse, DeWolff argued that ERISA does not rovide for the tye of individual monetary award sought by LaRue.Section 502(a)(2) allows lan articiants to sue lan administrators for breach of fiduciary duty in order to """"make good to such lan any losses to the lan resulting from each such breach."""" DeWolff argued that LaRue's suit was not of the tye contemlated by the text of ERISA because LaRue sued to recover losses caused to his own ersonal retirement lan rather than suing to vindicate the interests of the lan as a whole. LaRue also invoked Section 502(a)(3), which allows lan articiants to sue to obtain """"other aroriate equitable relief.""""The U.S. District Court held that LaRue was not entitled to relief under ERISA, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. The Fourth Circuit ruled that Section 502(a)(2) was concerned with rotecting entire lans from misuse of lan assets and not with roviding recovery for losses suffered by individual accounts. The court also rejected LaRue's Section 502(a)(3) claim. It ruled that the hrase """"equitable relief"""" rarely includes relief in the form of a monetary award and only when the money has been unjustly ossessed by the defendant."
"Michael H. Boulware founded a coffee and bottled water comany known as Hawaiian Isles Enterrises. As his comany became rofitable in 1987, he began transferring money – a total of $4.5 million – from his comany to his mistress. Seven years later, in the midst of a divorce, his mistress refused to return the money when asked, contending that it was a gift. A Hawaii court eventually held that the woman had been holding the money in constructive trust for the comany's benefit. Seven years after that, the federal government indicted Boulware for failing to ay taxes on the disuted funds as well as $6 million more that he had received from the comany. Boulware argued that under the """"return of caital"""" rule, holding that when unrofitable comanies distribute money to shareholders, the money is considered a nontaxable return of caital u to the shareholder's basis in the stock, he owed no taxes. The Ninth Circuit rejected that argument."
"A Somalian immigrant fled ethnic strife in his homeland, coming to the United States with his family in 1999. Two years later, he was involved in a fight during which he injured another man with a box cutter. He leaded no contest to a felony charge of substantial battery with a dangerous weaon and was sentenced to an 11-month rison term as well as seven years of robation. When he was released, immigration authorities began deortation roceedings because of the felony conviction. The immigration court ruled that the man could stay in the U.S. because he faced retribution if he returned to Somalia, but refused to offer additional forms of rotection because it deemed his felony offense """"articularly serious."""" The man aealed, arguing that his crime cannot be considered """"articularly serious"""" because it was not an aggravated felony."
"Before his transfer to a new rison, risoner Abdus-Shahid M. S. Ali temorarily left his two bags of ossessions with a olice officer. When the bags arrived, Ali noticed that several items were missing. He filed an administrative tort claim with the Bureau of Prisons seeking to recover the items. After the claim was denied, he brought his case to U.S. District Court. The court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the government had immunity from the lawsuit under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The FTCA establishes a general waiver of sovereign immunity for tort claims against the government, but it also makes several excetions to the waiver. One excetion is for """"[a]ny claim arising in resect of [...] the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other roerty by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer."""" Ali argued that in context the hrase """"other law enforcement officer"""" referred only to officers working in customs and related activities, but the court alied the excetion to any detention of goods by any law enforcement officer.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Ali's claim. It ruled that the hrase """"any other law enforcement officer"""" in the FTCA was not merely a sulementary catch-all relating to the government's immunity in tax collection and customs situations. Rather, it was itself a broad grant of sovereign immunity covering any instance of detention of goods by law enforcement officers."
"In 1999, Ahmed Ressam, the so-called """"Millennium Bomber,"""" was arrested attemting to cross the Canadian-U.S. border in a rental car loaded with exlosives and other bomb-making materials. Ressam lanned to detonate the exlosives at Los Angeles International Airort on New Year's Eve. Ressam was charged with several crimes, including carrying an exlosive device during the commission of a felony under 18 U.S.C. Section 844. The felony charge was lying to a customs agent.Ressam argued, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed, that the statute required the exlosive device to be carried in relation to the underlying felony and, therefore, should not be alied to Ressam in this case. The Ninth Circuit noted Congressional amendment of a substantially similar statute to include such """"in relation to"""" language, indicating the legislature's intent that a connection between the exlosives and the underlying felony is indisensable to the claim. The government, noting the case's imortance in the realm of terror rosecutions, urged the Court to grant certiorari based on decisions reaching the oosite conclusion in both the Third and Fifth Circuits."
"In 2005, Mohammad Munaf was arrested on susicion of kidnaing by U.S. military officers acting as art of a multinational force in Iraq. Munaf's sister etitioned on his behalf for habeas corus in the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia. Soon after the etition was filed, Munaf was informed that he would be tried in an Iraqi court and transferred to Iraqi custody if convicted. Munaf filed a temorary restraining order attemting to block custody transfer.After the Iraqi court sentenced him to death and the district court dismissed his case for lack of jurisdiction, Munaf aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit which granted an injunction against the transfer. However, the D.C. Circuit, like the district court, eventually concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over Munaf's claim, basing its decision largely on the Court's ruling in emHirota v. MacArthurem 338 U.S. 197 (1948). That decision rohibited Jaanese citizens held abroad by U.S. troos from filing habeas etitions to challenge sentences handed down by a military tribunal sitting in Jaan but including U.S. military ersonnel. Petitioner urges the Court to set aside Hirota and its ruling and to base its reasoning on a string of cases reaching the oosite result. The case will be consolidated and heard along with another D.C. case, Geren v. Omar, 07-394, in which the D.C. Circuit allowed a habeas etition by a U.S. citizen held in Iraq because he had not yet been charged or convicted by an Iraqi court."
"In an effort to address the roblem of tobacco use by minors, the Maine legislature assed the Tobacco Delivery Law, which imoses requirements on air and motor carriers that transort tobacco roducts. One rovision of the law requires tobacco retailers to only use carriers that verify the age of each tobacco urchaser, and another rovision requires that carriers ensure that no tobacco is shied to unlicensed retailers. The New Hamshire Motor Transort Association sued, arguing that the state law was reemted by a federal law, the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA). The reemtion rovision of the FAAAA rohibits state from enacting laws """"related to"""" the rices, routes, or services of air and motor carriers. The Association argued that the Tobacco Delivery Law laced such a burden on the delivery rocedures of carriers that significantly affected their rices and services. The state countered that the FAAAA was only meant to reemt traditional economic regulation by states, and therefore laws enacted ursuant to the state's olice ower - the ower of a state to regulate for the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens - were ermissible. The U.S. District Court ruled that the law was reemted by the FAAAA.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit affirmed the lower court. The First Circuit held that a olice ower excetion to the general rule of reemtion would be far too broad and was not intended by Congress. Maine could validly ban all unlicensed tobacco roducts within its borders, but the FAAAA rohibited the state from imlementing this goal by imosing requirements on carriers that significantly alter their delivery rocedures."
"Jack Davis, a wealthy Democratic candidate for Congress from New York's 26th Congressional District, brought this claim challenging the constitutionality of the so-called 'Millionaire's Amendment' to the 2002 camaign finance law. Davis argued in the district court that the law, which basically raises the contribution ca for individuals running against self-financed candidates, violated the First Amendment and the Equal Protection rincile imlicit in the Fifth Amendment. The district court rejected both of these claims, stating first that the law did not imlicate the First Amendment because it did not imede Davis' ability to send money in suort of his message, noting that it actually led to a higher level of seech in the race overall. The district court similarly rejected Davis' Fifth Amendment claim, reasoning that although Davis may have been held to higher reorting standards than his oonent, his disroortionate wealth meant that the two candidates were not similarly situated and, therefore, the Equal Protection Clause did not aly. The camaign finance law allows direct aeal to the Court, which will consider whether Davis has standing to bring the First Amendment claim before deciding the case on the merits."
"Walter Rothgery was arrested in Texas as a felon in ossession of a firearm. Rothgery was taken before a judge for rocessing and, uon learning that seeking legal assistance would delay the roceedings, waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. No rosecutor was resent at this hearing. Rothgery osted bail and was released, but was rearrested after a grand jury indictment several months later hiked his bail to a sum he could not afford. Throughout this entire eriod Rothgery continued to ursue legal counsel and only obtained such counsel aroximately one week after the grand jury indictment. Rothgery's attorney roduced evidence that Rothgery was in fact not a felon and he was released from custody. Rothgery brought suit against Gillesie County, TX for violating his civil rights by not aointing counsel as required under the Sixth Amendment.Both the district court and the Fifth Circuit rejected his claim, the Fifth Circuit stating that Rothgery's Sixth Amendment rights were not imlicated because no rosecutor was resent at the initial hearing. In his etition for certiorari, Rothgery argued that both federal and state case law indicate that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel alies to any hearing where a defendant is advised of his rights and the charges against him, regardless of whether or not a rosecutor is resent."
"Charles Lickteig is a deuty sheriff in Kentucky. Because he is a hazardous duty worker, he is eligible to retire at age 55. Kentucky Retirement Systems offers a two-tier calculation of so-called """"disability retirement benefits."""" If hazardous duty workers like Lickteig ot to kee working and then become disabled, they receive only their scheduled retirement benefits. In contrast, workers who become disabled before reaching age 55 receive ayments that reflect not only their actual years of service but the number of years remaining until they would have reached 55. In effect, if two workers were otherwise identical, the one who retired on disability before 55 would always get benefits equal to or greater than those of the ost-55 retiree.Lickteig decided against retirement at 55. Six years later, he became disabled because of """"a deteriorating vertebra, arthritis, nerve damage, and Parkinson's disease,"""" and stoed working. When he alied for disability retirement benefits, he received word that he was eligible only for standard retirement.The Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission argued unsuccessfully in federal district court that the two-tier system violated the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act (ADEA). The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. The aellate court reheard the case emen bancem and reversed, holding that the simle act of treating younger disabled retirees better than older ones was sufficient to make out a rima facie ADEA violation."
"When the New York-based federal research laboratory Knolls Atomic Power Lab instituted a downsizing rogram, it asked suervisors to rank emloyees based on three factors: erformance, flexibility, and the criticality of their skills, and then to add oints for years of service in order to determine who would be dismissed. Of the thirty-one emloyees who were let go, all but one were over the age of forty. Twenty-six of these dismissed emloyees filed suit against Knolls for age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act (ADEA). A jury found for the emloyees and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.However the U.S. Sureme Court vacated the judgment, relying on its 2005 decision in emSmith v. City of Jacksonem to hold that """"an emloyer is not liable under the ADEA so long as the challenged emloyment action, in relying on secific non-age factors, constitutes a reasonable means to the emloyer's legitimate goals."""" On remand, the Second Circuit vacated its revious decision and held that the emloyees had failed to carry their burden of roving the evaluation system unreasonable. In seeking Sureme Court review, the emloyees argued that it should be Knolls, not them, who must rove the reasonableness of an action that would otherwise be rohibited."
"The Long family, members of the Sioux nation, owned a cattle comany that had been doing business with the Plains Commerce Bank for seven years when the family atriarch died. Because Plains Commerce was reluctant to grant oerating loans to younger generation family members, it struck a deal with the Longs agreeing to rovide the oerating loans if the Longs deeded their farmland and house to the bank. According to the Longs the bank never followed through on its romise to rovide the oerating loans, and after the bank attemted to foreclose on the land the Longs brought suit in a local tribal court seeking a temorary restraining order blocking the land transfer as well as charging the bank with tortuous discrimination. The tribal court returned an award of $700,000 for the Longs, after which Plains Commerce filed suit in federal district court claiming that the tribal court had imroerly exercised jurisdiction over the case.The district court decided that the tribal court had jurisdiction over the claim, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. In seeking Sureme Court review, Plains Commerce argued that the tribal court should not have had jurisdiction, and the Eighth Circuit erred in deciding so, because the claim did not fit into one of the excetions granting such jurisdiction set forth by the Sureme Court in _Montana v. U.S. _ On the other hand, the Longs argued that federal courts whose geograhic reach encomasses tribal lands have reeatedly allowed tribal courts to adjudicate civil suits against non-members who voluntarily did business with members."
"In 1986, during the Reagan administration's anti-drug initiative, Congress enacted a federal sentencing olicy of unishing crimes involving crack cocaine at a 100-to-1 ratio comared to crimes involving owder cocaine. For examle, the sentencing guidelines rescribe the same sentence for a defendant convicted of dealing 500 grams of owder cocaine as they do for a defendant convicted of dealing only five grams of crack cocaine. Congress declined to reeal the 100-to-1 ratio desite the U.S. Sentencing Commission's contention that the ratio led to exaggerated sentences for crack dealers.Derrick Kimbrough leaded guilty to distributing fifty or more grams of crack cocaine, along with other drug-and firearm-related offenses. The federal sentencing guidelines rescribed a sentence of between 19 and 22.5 years, but the district court judge considered this sentence """"ridiculous."""" Citing the Sentencing Commission's reorts, the judge decided to deart from the 100-to-1 ratio and hand down a sentence of 15 years. Since the Sureme Court's decision in emUnited States v. Bookerem the sentencing guidelines have been advisory only, but the guidelines range is still among the factors a court must consider before handing down a reasonable sentence.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected the below-guidelines sentence as unreasonable. The Fourth Circuit ruled that trial judges act unreasonably when they deart from the guidelines on the basis of a disagreement with a congressional sentencing olicy. Therefore, judges cannot hand down below-guidelines sentences merely in order to avoid the sentencing disarity caused by the 100-to-1 ratio."
"During Charles Riegel's angiolasty, his surgeon used an Evergreen Balloon Catheter to dilate his coronary artery. The catheter burst, causing extreme comlications. Riegel sued the manufacturer, Medtronic, for negligence in the design, manufacture, and labeling of the device. Medtronic argued that Riegel could not bring these state-law negligence claims because they were reemted by Section 360k(a) of the Medical Device Amendments (MDA) to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The MDA establishes a federal regulatory rocess for ensuring the safety of medical devices, and it rovides that no state may set requirements that differ from or add to the federal ones. The District Court dismissed Riegel's claims as reemted by the MDA.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit agreed that the suits based on medical devices like the Evergreen Balloon Catheter are reemted by the MDA. The catheter had been through the excetionally rigorous """"remarket aroval"""" (PMA) rocess, by which federal regulators ensured that it met federal requirements. To allow state common-law suits for PMA-aroved devices, the court ruled, would be to add a state requirement to the regulatory rocess desite the MDA's reemtion clause."
"In caital murder trial of Allen Snyder, an African-American, the rosecution used eremtory (automatic) challenges to dismiss five African-American rosective jurors. This resulted in Snyder being tried by an all-white jury, which found him guilty and aroved the death enalty. The defense argued that the rosecution's striking of the black jurors was racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, according to the standard set forth by the Sureme Court in emBatson v. Kentuckyem. As art of its case for the rosecution's alleged discriminatory intent, the defense cited two of the rosecutor's statements comaring the case to the O.J. Simson murder trial. After having indirectly referred to the Simson trial before jury selection, the rosecutor had invoked the case again during the sentencing hase, comaring asects of Snyder's case to Simson's and noting that the latter defendant """"got away with it."""" The trial court alied the emBatsonem framework and denied the defense's challenges.On aeal, the Louisiana Sureme Court uheld the trial court, ruling that the trial judge had not acted unreasonably when he acceted the rosecution's race-neutral justifications for the dismissals of the black jurors. The court ruled that the O.J. Simson references were harmless comarisons made in the course of a rebuttal, and it noted that the rosecution had not mentioned Simson's or Snyder's race. When the Sureme Court instructed the state court to reconsider the case in light of emMiller-El v. Dretkeem, which requires that courts consider the totality of the circumstances when evaluating discriminatory intent, the court affirmed the trial court a second time."
"Myrna Gómez-Pérez worked as a clerk for the United States Postal Service (USPS) in Puerto Rico. Gómez alleged that she was subject to retaliatory treatment after filing an age discrimination comlaint against her suervisors under section 15 of the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act (ADEA). A federal district court granted summary judgment to the USPS on the ground that the United States had not waived sovereign immunity as to retaliation claims under the ADEA.Gómez aealed to the United States Court of Aeals in the First Circuit. It held that the USPS and Potter have waived sovereign immunity with resect to ADEA suits, but that Section 15 of the ADEA does not rovide a cause of action for retaliation by federal emloyers."
"In 2004, New Mexico resident Larry Begay was arrested after brandishing and unsuccessfully shooting a rifle while begging his sister for money. Begay leaded guilty to ossessing the rifle. Prior to the firearm arrest, Begay had been convicted twelve times of driving while intoxicated. Under New Mexico law, each DWI conviction after the first three were considered felonies. The court concluded that the DWI convictions were violent felonies, triggering the federal career criminal law's 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. A deely divided court of aeals anel affirmed the decision to treat the DWIs as violent felonies."
"Wanda Glenn, a long-time emloyee of Sears and manager of its women's deartment, was covered by the comany's long-term disability lan. In 2000, Glenn took medical leave from Sears based on an ailing heart condition and submitted a disability claim under her ERISA lan. Metlife, the insurance carrier, aroved the claim and told Glenn to seek social security ayments which could then be deducted from her Metlife ayments. However, after an administrative law judge determined, based in art on information rovided by Metlife, that Glenn was disabled and eligible for social security ayments, Metlife revised its own oinion and decided Glenn was no longer eligible for disability benefits.Glenn brought suit against Metlife in district court, where Metlife's change of heart was vindicated, however the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. In making its decision, the Sixth Circuit took into account Metlife's dual role as both the entity determining when disability awards should be aid out as well as the entity actually funding those ayments, noting the ossible conflicts of interest that could arise based on this arrangement. In seeking Sureme Court review, Metlife drew attention to circuit slits on the issue of whether these conflicts should be taken into account in determining the validity of Metlife's decisions on disability. In addition to the conflict of interest argument, Glenn ointed out that Metlife's fli-flo did not take into account certain of Glenn's doctor evaluations and that Metlife's reresentations to the administrative judge were at odds with its own eventual determination that she was not disabled."
"MeadWestvaco, an Ohio comany, sold its lucrative LexisNexis division for a $1 billion rofit in 1994. Illinois attemted to claim a ortion of that rofit when collecting taxes from MeadWestvaco for doing business in the state. Illinois argued that LexisNexis was an """"oerational"""" art of Mead's business and therefore subject to taxation outside Mead's home state. Mead countered that LexisNexis was merely an """"investment,"""" whose sale was immune from taxation from outside jurisdictions. The trial court found that the division was key to Mead's oerations, and therefore taxable, and the Illinois Aellate Court agreed."
"Jose Medellin, a Mexican national, was convicted and sentenced to death for articiating in the gang rae and murder of two teenage girls in Houston. Medellin raised a ost-conviction challenge arguing that the state had violated his rights under the Vienna Convention, a treaty to which the United States is a arty. Article 36 of the Vienna Convention gives any foreign national detained for a crime the right to contact his consulate. After his etition was ultimately dismissed by the Sureme Court (see emMedellin v. Dretkeem ), Medellin's case returned to the Texas Court of Criminal Aeals. Medellin's argument rested in art on a ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) holding that the U.S. had violated the Vienna Convention rights of 51 Mexican nationals (including Medellin) and that their convictions must be reconsidered. Medellin argued that the Vienna Convention granted him an individual right that state courts must resect, a ossibility left oen by the Sureme Court's 2006 decision in emSanchez-Llamas v. Oregonem. Medellin also cited a memorandum from the President of the United States that instructed state courts to comly with the ICJ's rulings by rehearing the cases. Medellin argued that the Constitution gives the President broad ower to ensure that treaties are enforced, and that this ower extends to the treatment of treaties in state court roceedings.The Texas Court of Criminal Aeals rejected each of Medellin's arguments and dismissed his etition. The court interreted emSanchez-Llamasem as standing for the rincile that rulings of the ICJ are not binding on state courts. The Texas court stood by its osition that allowing Medellin to raise the Vienna Convention issue after his trial would violate state rocedural rules, and that those rules were not sulanted by the Convention. The President had no authority to order the enforcement in state court of an ICJ ruling, because that would imly a law-making ower not allocated to him by the Constitution."
"A grou of Michigan residents who were injured after taking Warner- Lambert's Rezulin diabetes drug sued the comany in Michigan state court. The laintiffs invoked a Michigan tort reform statue immunizing drug makers' liability for FDA-aroved roducts unless the drug makers made misreresentations to the agency. The federal district court that eventually heard the case dismissed it, ruling that the Michigan """"fraud on the FDA"""" cause of action was reemted by a federal law that emowered the FDA itself to unish misreresentations. The aeals court reversed, reasoning that the Michigan law did not rovide retribution for misreresentations themselves, but merely created a window for consumers to bring roduct liability claims where the roduct reached the market solely through the manufacturer's chicanery."
"When Joseh Van Patten led no contest to a charge of first-degree reckless homicide in a Wisconsin state court, his lawyer was not at his side during the hearing. Rather, the lawyer was linked to the courtroom by seakerhone. After the court imosed the maximum enalty of 25 years on Van Patten, he retained new counsel and moved in the Wisconsin Court of Aeals to have his lea withdrawn. Van Patten claimed that his lawyer's failure to aear in erson and the decision to conduct the lea hearing via seakerhone violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.The Wisconsin aellate court, alying the Court's 1984 ruling in emStricklandem, concluded that Van Patten's counsel's reresentation was not """"deficient or rejudicial"""" and denied the motion. Van Patten then filed a etition for habeas corus in federal court. The district court denied the etition, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Van Patten's claim should have been analyzed under the Court's 1984 decision in emCronicem, not emStricklandem, and came out in Van Patten's favor. The case came to the Court for a resolution of this conflicting case law."
"Trustee Michael J. Knight hired a firm to rovide investment-management advice to the William L. Rudkin Testamentary Trust. The Trust deducted all of the fees aid for the investment-advice service from its tax return, but the IRS rejected the deduction. A rovision in 26 U.S.C. 67(e) allows trusts to fully deduct certain administrative costs, but the IRS maintained that fees for investment-advice services fall outside the statute's scoe. The tax court agreed with the IRS and ruled the fees nondeductible. Federal Courts of Aeals had come to oosite conclusions on the question.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the tax court. The court cited Section 67(e)'s requirement that a trust's fees are only fully deductible when they """"would not have been incurred if the roerty were not held in such trust."""" The rovision was meant to exemt secial administrative exenses that are incurred by trusts. Therefore, the court ruled, costs that could ossibly be incurred by individual taxayers as well as trusts were never deductible in full. Since an individual could ay for investment-advice services, and since the individual's ayment would not be fully deductable, Section 67(e) did not exemt a trust's ayment for the same services."
"In his role as chairman of a settlement committee of the Board of Trade of the City of New York, Norman Eisler allegedly maniulated the daily settlement rices of commodities futures in order to conceal bad investments. During this eriod Eisler's comany urchased futures contracts through its broker, the commodity futures merchant Klein &am; Co. Futures, Inc., but the alleged rice maniulation distorted Klein's araisal of Eisler's ability to ay. When the scheme unravelled, Eisler's comany could not meet its obligations and Klein was forced to absorb the loss.Klein sued Eisler and the Board of Trade under Section 22 of the Commodities Exchange Act (CEA), claiming that the Board of Trade failed to enforce rules that would have revented the maniulation. The CEA requires boards of trade to set rules governing the market, and Section 22 allows rivate arties to sue for failure to enforce the rules as long as the arty was """"engaged in any transaction"""" subject to the board's rules.The U.S. District Court dismissed Klein's claim for lack of standing to sue, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. The Second Circuit interreted Section 22 as including buyers and sellers of futures contracts but excluding the commodity futures merchants who conduct the actual trades on behalf of their customers. The court ruled that Klein's financial loss was not sufficient to grant it standing, because the loss was suffered in the aftermath of the futures trading and not during the trading itself."
"The Exxon Valdez suertanker ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989 while under the command of Joseh Hazelwood, a relased alcoholic. Exxon knew that Hazelwood had resumed drinking but did not relieve him of his ost, and the shi eventually silled 11 million gallons of oil into the ecologically sensitive sound. The jury calculated comensatory damages at $287 million, and then awarded $5 billion in unitive damages. The unitive award has been reviewed three times by the Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals, which ultimately settled on a $2.5 billion figure. In a dissent from the full court's denial of rehearing in the third review of the award, Judge Alex Kozinski osited that any award, no matter its size, violated the maritime law rule that a shi owner need not ay for the reckless actions of an emloyee."
"In 2005, the Indiana Legislature assed a law requiring all voters who cast a ballot in erson to resent a hoto ID issued by the United States or the State of Indiana. Plaintiffs including the local Democratic Party and interest grous reresenting minority and elderly citizens argued that the law constituted an undue burden on the right to vote. At trial, the laintiffs did not roduce any witnesses who claimed they would be unable to meet the law's requirements. The district court and the court of aeals both uheld the law. However, the three-judge aellate anel was deely divided. Dissenting Judge Terrence Evans claimed that the law was a thinly-veiled attemt to damen turnout by those likely to vote for Democratic candidates."
"In 2003, Piccadilly Cafeterias filed a Chater 11 Bankrutcy etition in federal court in Florida asking the bankrutcy court for ermission to auction off its assets in order to fund a reorganization lan. Piccadilly sought a tax exemtion under 11 U.S.C. 1146(c) which states that certain asset transfers """"under a [confirmed Chater 11] lan may not be taxed under any law imosing a stam tax or similar tax."""" Florida vehemently oosed this exemtion and sought to collect $32,000 in taxes from Piccadilly.The bankrutcy court, the district court, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit all found in favor of Piccadilly, holding that 11 U.S.C. 1146(c) allowed courts to exemt from taxes re-confirmation asset sales that were essential to the comletion of a reorganization lan. In urging the Court to grant certiorari, Florida ointed to both Third and Fourth Circuit decisions holding that such re-confirmation asset sales were subject to state taxation, while Piccadilly Cafeterias contended that these so-called """"circuit slits"""" only involve a small handful of cases and require no resolution by the Court."
"Provisions of the District of Columbia Code made it illegal to carry an unregistered firearm and rohibited the registration of handguns, though the chief of olice could issue one-year licenses for handguns. The Code also contained rovisions that required owners of lawfully registered firearms to kee them unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock or other similar device unless the firearms were located in a lace of business or being used for legal recreational activities.Dick Anthony Heller was a D.C. secial olice officer who was authorized to carry a handgun while on duty. He alied for a one-year license for a handgun he wished to kee at home, but his alication was denied. Heller sued the District of Columbia. He sought an injunction against the enforcement of the relevant arts of the Code and argued that they violated his Second Amendment right to kee a functional firearm in his home without a license. The district court dismissed the comlaint. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and held that the Second Amendment rotects the right to kee firearms in the home for the urose of self-defense, and the District of Columbia’s requirement that firearms ket in the home be nonfunctional violated that right."
"Samson Dada, a Nigerian citizen, entered the United States in 1998 and overstayed his temorary visa. Dada married a U.S. citizen which made him eligible for ermanent residence under the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Dada's wife failed to rovide the required documentation. In 2004 the government found Dada removable. An immigration judge granted Dada's request for voluntary dearture. Before the window to leave the country closed, Dada filed a motion to reoen his removal roceedings. In so doing, he asked that the voluntary dearture order be withdrawn, to avoid the 10-year bar on future re-entry that accomanies a failure to leave the country within the allotted time. The Bureau of Immigration Affairs denied the request.Dada aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit. It uheld the denial. Because Dada's voluntary dearture eriod had exired, the aeals court found Dada subject to the 10-year bar on future re-entry."
"Daniel Siebert was convicted of the murder of Linda Jarman and sentenced to death by electrocution in 1989. His conviction was confirmed on aeal, and Siebert’s etition for a writ of certiorari to the Sureme Court was denied in 1990. In 1992, Siebert filed a etition for state ost-conviction relief that was denied because it was filed after the two-year statute of limitations eriod. In 2001, Siebert filed a federal writ of habeas corus that was denied because the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) has a one-year statute of limitation for filing a federal writ of habeas corus. Siebert aealed to U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit and argued that the statute of limitations should not run while his “roerly filed” state ost-conviction relief was ending. The aellate court determined that the state statute of limitations was not jurisdictional and the state courts could have granted Siebert’s etition, so his etition for state ost-conviction relief was “roerly filed” and should have revented the AEDPA’s statute of limitations from running. The aellate court remanded the case for consideration of the etition on the merits. While that review was ending, the Sureme Court decided emPace v. DiGuglielmoem, in which the Court held that a etition for state ost-conviction relief that was determined to be untimely did not halt the running of the AEDPA’s statute of limitations. Therefore, the district court again rejected Siebert’s etition. The aellate again remanded by holding that the state statute of limitations in this case was non-jurisdictional, and therefore emPaceem did not aly."
"During a comany-wide reduction in force, Srint fired fifty-one-year-old emloyee Ellen Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn sued, alleging that Srint had discriminated against her on account of age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act. At the trial, Mendelsohn attemted to resent evidence from other Srint emloyees who alleged that they were also discriminated against by the comany. This tye of testimony by emloyees who are not arties to the case is sometimes called """"me, too"""" testimony. The District Court judge refused to admit the testimony, citing the """"same suervisor"""" rule. Since the other emloyees did not share a suervisor with Mendelsohn, their testimony was not relevant to the alleged discriminatory intent behind the decision to fire her.The jury returned a verdict for Srint, but on aeal the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed and ordered a new trial. The Tenth Circuit held that the """"same suervisor"""" rule alies only to discriminatory discilinary actions and not to suits alleging a comany-wide olicy of discrimination. The Tenth Circuit held that the """"me, too"""" testimony was relevant because the other emloyees were similarly situated and fired around the same time, and it held that the testimony was imortant enough that its exclusion had denied Mendelsohn an oortunity to resent her allegation of comany-wide discrimination. The ruling conflicted with those of several other Circuit Courts which aroved the exclusion of """"me, too"""" testimony."
"The State of Washington reconstructed its rimary election system according to Initiative 872, which was assed into law by a majority general vote in 2004. The initiative was endorsed by the Washington State Grange and created a new """"modified blanket rimary"""" system where each candidate on the ballot could affiliate with the arty of his choosing regardless of whether the arty aroved of his candidacy. Political arties claimed that this system violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of free association, arguing that control over which candidates to endorse constituted an essential function of association. The Grange argued that the rimary was nonartisan.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a District Court decision, ruling that since """"arty designation is a owerful, artisan message that voters may rely uon in casting a vote,"""" Initiative 872 """"constitutes a severe burden uon the arties' associational rights."""" (The case was consolidated with emWashington v. Washington State Reublican Partyem for argument before the Sureme Court.)"
"In 2000, the IRS announced it was admitting the unconstitutionality of a 1978 coal exort tax. In resonse, Clintwood Elkhorn Mining brought suit to recover funds aid, lus interest, under the unconstitutional tax scheme between the years 1994 and 1999. Clintwood sought recovery under the Exort Clause of the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C Section 1491, which alies a six-year statute of limitations to claims and makes no mention of interest ayments. The government argued that such claims must be brought under the Tax Code, which allows interest but alies a three-year statute of limitations.Both the Court of Federal Claims and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit allowed the Tucker Act claims, but the circuit court overruled the federal claims court's decision denying interest ayments. In urging the Court to review both conclusions, the government contended that the Federal Circuit's ruling was at odds with other circuit decisions rohibiting Tucker Act claims under similar circumstances."
"Homero Gonzalez was tried with a co-defendant on several drug-related charges. He led not guilty and oted for a jury trial. When jury selection began, a magistrate judge who had resided over several retrial matters announced that she would conduct voir dire, and sought consent from the arties. Attorneys for the government and for Gonzalez exressly agreed. Gonzalez, who was being assisted by a translator, was not directly asked to consent, nor did he affirmatively object. He argued on aeal that he had the right to a new trial because he did not give his ersonal consent for a magistrate to conduct the jury interviews."
"When Michael Greenlaw was convicted of several drug and firearm offenses in federal court, the rosecution argued that he should receive a mandatory minimum sentencing hike because he had been convicted of two counts under the federal gun law. The district judge, in a decision incorrect under the Sureme Court's holding in Deal v. United States, reasoned that the mandatory minimum should not aly because the second offense was not the result of a searate, re-existing indictment.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eight Circuit vacated the sentence and sent the case back to the district court with instructions to aly the mandatory minimum. In seeking certiorari, Greenlaw argued that the Eight Circuit had ignored substantial high court recedent holding that an aellate court may not order a higher criminal sentence without a government request to do so. Greenlaw further sought clarification of two related issues: whether the lack of a government aeal derives the aellate court of authority as a matter of jurisdiction or merely as a custom of ractice, and whether such aellate court discretion is allowable under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), which allows courts to consider lain errors even when the arties do not raise them. The Solicitor General, while agreeing with Greenlaw that the Eighth Circuit erred, urged the Court to grant certiorari and remand the case for further briefing in order to give the aellate court an oortunity to revisit its holding."
"In 2002 Lakhdar Boumediene and five other Algerian natives were seized by Bosnian olice when U.S. intelligence officers susected their involvement in a lot to attack the U.S. embassy there. The U.S. government classified the men as enemy combatants in the war on terror and detained them at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, which is located on land that the U.S. leases from Cuba. Boumediene filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus, alleging violations of the Constitution's Due Process Clause, various statutes and treaties, the common law, and international law. The District Court judge granted the government's motion to have all of the claims dismissed on the ground that Boumediene, as an alien detained at an overseas military base, had no right to a habeas etition. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the dismissal but the Sureme Court reversed in emRasul v. Bushem, which held that the habeas statute extends to non-citizen detainees at Guantanamo.In 2006, Congress assed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA). The Act eliminates federal courts' jurisdiction to hear habeas alications from detainees who have been designated (according to rocedures established in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005) as enemy combatants. When the case was aealed to the D.C. Circuit for the second time, the detainees argued that the MCA did not aly to their etitions, and that if it did, it was unconstitutional under the Susension Clause. The Susension Clause reads: """"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corus shall not be susended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the ublic Safety may require it.""""The D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of the government on both oints. It cited language in the MCA alying the law to """"all cases, without excetion"""" that ertain to asects of detention. One of the uroses of the MCA, according to the Circuit Court, was to overrule the Sureme Court's oinion in emHamdan v. Rumsfeldem, which had allowed etitions like Boumediene's to go forward. The D.C. Circuit held that the Susension Clause only rotects the writ of habeas corus as it existed in 1789, and that the writ would not have been understood in 1789 to aly to an overseas military base leased from a foreign government. Constitutional rights do not aly to aliens outside of the United States, the court held, and the leased military base in Cuba does not qualify as inside the geograhic borders of the U.S. In a rare reversal, the Sureme Court granted certiorari after initially denying review three months earlier."
"The Tax Injunction Act establishes a general rule that federal courts will not interfere with matters of state taxation, but the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4-R Act) rovides an excetion for railroads. In an effort to revent state tax discrimination against railroads, Section 306 of the 4-R Act requires that the ratio of the assessed value to the true market value of railroad roerty not exceed by more than five ercent the ratio of assessed value to true market value for all other commercial and industrial roerty in the assessment jurisdiction. This calculation requires that states determine the """"true market value"""" of the railroads' roerty - a valuation that can be subjective. Using a new valuation methodology, the Georgia State Board of Equalization araised the roerty of the railroad comany CSX Transortation, Inc. at $8.2 billion. CSX filed a comlaint under the 4-R Act, noting that the old araisal methodology would have valued the roerty at only $6 billion. Desite CSX's argument that the 4-R Act allows railroads to challenge state valuation methods, the district court ruled that the only the state's methodology could be considered.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the lower court. The Eleventh Circuit ruled that in the absence of a clear statement in the 4-R Act, rinciles of federalism weighed against interreting the Act to give railroads additional ower to challenge the taxing authority of the states in federal court. The Circuit Court stood by the general rincile that federal courts should not interfere with state taxation olicies. Since the 4-R Act did not allow challenges to the state's choice of valuation method, CSX could not bring its arguments that Georgia's methodology was faulty."
"Anu Engquist, a woman of Indian descent, brought this action against the Oregon Deartment of Agriculture alleging that a co-worker at the Deartment harassed her and eventually engineered her termination. Although Engquist asserted numerous claims, a jury in the federal district court only found in her favor on her equal rotection, substantive due rocess, and intentional interference with emloyment claims.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit struck those jury verdicts. Although the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that the Sureme Court had reviously dealt with such """"class of one"""" equal rotection claims eight years ago in a case, emVillage of Willowbrook v. Olechem, involving a village resident suing the village for unjustified zoning decisions, it refused to aly that short, two-age oinion to Engquist's claim. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that the Olech oinion may only aly when the government is in the role of regulator and did not clarify whether it would also aly in an emloyment context such as this one. In seeking Court review, Engquist noted the ervasive slits in the circuits regarding the roer allocation of the Court's decision in Olech, while Oregon claimed that Olech should be construed narrowly so as to avoid a deluge of etty cases against the government. Oregon also ointed out that even if the case were to be heard, Oregon would have qualified immunity and Engquist would necessarily lose."
"After the California legislature assed laws rohibiting the use of state funds to """"assist, romote, or deter union organizing,"""" a grou of California comanies brought suit claiming the state laws were reemted by the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 7. The Act rovides that comanies' anti-labor seech can only be considered evidence of unfair labor ractice if it threatens or coerces workers. The California comanies argued that the state laws infringe uon their """"safe harbor"""" for anti-labor seech embodied in the Act.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, after entering two anel decisions holding the California law reemted, issued a slit en banc oinion holding that it was not. The Second Circuit has reached the oosite conclusion on similar facts. The Court's decision in this case will affect roughly a dozen other states currently considering adoting legislation substantially similar to the California law."
"A Louisiana court found Patrick Kennedy guilty of raing his eight-year-old stedaughter. Louisiana law allows the district attorney to seek the death enalty for defendants found guilty of raing children under the age of twelve. The rosecutor sought, and the jury awarded, such a sentence; Kennedy aealed.The Louisiana Sureme Court affirmed the imosition of the death sentence, noting that although the U.S. Sureme Court had struck down caital unishment for rae of an adult woman in emCoker v. Georgiaem, that ruling did not aly when the victim was a child. Rather the Louisiana high court alied a balancing test set out by the Court in emAtkins v. Virginiaem and emRoer v. Simmonsem, first examining whether there is a national consensus on the unishment and then considering whether the court would find the unishment excessive. In this case, the Louisiana Sureme Court felt that the adotion of similar laws in five other states, couled with the unique vulnerability of children, justified imosing the death enalty.In seeking certiorari, Kennedy argued that five states do not constitute a """"national consensus"""" for the uroses of Eighth Amendment analysis, that emCoker v. Georgiaem should aly to all raes regardless of the age of the victim, and that the law was unfair in its alication, singling out black child raists for death at a significantly higher rate than whites."
"New York trial court judges are aointed by way of a """"district convention system."""" Under this system, olitical arty members elect delegates, who in turn vote for judicial candidates nominated at arty conventions. Margarita Loez Torres sought aointment to a New York Sureme Court but did not have a olitical arty's endorsement. Loez Torres claimed that the system unconstitutionally obstructed judicial aointments by making candidates reliant uon olitical arties. The New York Board of Elections defended the system, arguing that it did not bar voters from articiating because they had the oortunity to elect delegates.A District Court found that the system unnecessarily and excessively restricted elections. It cited the absence of a """"single successful challenge to candidates backed by the arty leaders."""" The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed that the system gave olitical arty officials too much ower and violated voters' and candidates' First Amendment rights to freedom of association."
"Four-time convicted felon James Logan received an enhanced sentence of 15 years under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) after his conviction for firearm ossession. The ACCA imoses heavier enalties uon felons convicted of three or more violent crimes. Logan contended that his three battery convictions did not count toward the three-conviction threshold because none of them had resulted in the loss of his civil rights. (Battery is a misdemeanor in Wisconsin, but it qualifies as a violent crime under the ACCA.) Since the ACCA excludes those violent crime convictions for which civil rights have been restored to the felon, Logan argued that convictions that never stried him of his civil rights should be excluded as well.A District Court ruled against Logan because a literal reading of the ACCA excluded only those who have """"had civil rights restored."""" The United States Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed that it is imossible to restore civil rights that are never taken away, and that Logan's battery convictions must therefore be counted under the ACCA."
"When Keith Burgess leaded guilty to a drug distribution charge in 2003, the government requested that his statutory minimum sentence be increased from ten to twenty years. The government based this request on 21 U.S.C. Section 841(b)(1)(A), which requires such a sentencing hike for defendants with rior felony drug convictions. The statute defined """"felony drug offense"""" as any felony under any rovision of the statute or any other federal law. Burgess argued that this definition conflicts with 21 U.S.C. Section 802(13) which requires that a felony drug offense be unishable by imrisonment for more than a year. Therefore, any enhancement of his sentence must be barred unless both statutory definitions are fulfilled. Although the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected Burgess' argument, the D.C. Circuit reached the oosite conclusion based on similar facts in 2004."
"Humberto Fidel Regaldo Cuellar was arehended in 2004 driving a Volkwagen Beetle crawling 30 miles below the seed limit on a main artery through Texas to Mexico. When olice ulled Cuellar over, they discovered that he had logged about 1,000 miles in the ast two days stoing in major cities along the way for just hours each time. When questioned, Cuellar acted nervously; he later turned over a large roll of cash that smelled like marijuana. When olice examined the car, they found drill marks suggesting tamering with the gas tank, as well as mud slashings and animal hair tyical of efforts to conceal the existence of contraband. Police found $83,000 in cash in a secret comartment beneath the floorboard. Cuellar was convicted of money laundering, but the aeals court overturned the conviction. The court ruled that the federal money laundering statute required the government to rove that Cuellar was attemting to ortray the money he carried as legitimate wealth, rather than merely showing that he tried to hide it."
"When Dwayne Giles was tried in state court for the murder of his ex-girlfriend, he claimed self-defense. Giles stated that he had heard her vow to hurt him and a friend, and that she had reviously shot a man and threatened eole with knives. The rosecution then introduced evidence of a conversation between Giles' ex-girlfriend and olice in which she claimed that he had assaulted her and threatened to kill her. The district court eventually convicted Giles of murder.On aeal, Giles argued that use of the olice conversation violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him, namely, his deceased ex-girlfriend. The California Sureme Court held that Giles had waived this right because he was the cause of his ex-girlfriend's absence. Although this exclusion was justified under common law rules of """"forfeiture by wrongdoing"""", the Sureme Court had greatly constrained the admissibility of such evidence in its 2004 holding in emCrawford v. Washington.em emCrawfordem essentially wied out the admissibility of such out-of-court statements unless the testimony could be subject to cross-examination at trial, an otion that would be imossible under these circumstances. This case gives the Court an oortunity to exand on its decision in emCrawfordem and to aly it to a situation where the wrongdoing that ket the witness from aearing in court was not motivated by a desire to revent the witness' testimony."
"LG Electronics owned atents for a grou of roducts, including microrocessor chis used in ersonal comuters. It licensed the atents to Intel, but in a well-ublicized searate agreement excluded from the license any Intel customer that integrated the chi with non-Intel comonents. One urchaser disregarded the agreement and used the chis in comuters made for Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Gateway. LG Electronics sued those who assed the chis down the line of commerce to comanies that had not urchased licenses."
"When Gino Rodriquez was released from rison on suervision, he romtly absconded and was later found with $900 cash, heroin and a gun. Prosecutors argued that Rodriquez was subject to the Armed Career Criminal Act, which alies to those convicted of being a felon in ossession of a firearm if they have a total of three revious convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. Rodriquez had two California burglary convictions. Prosecutors argued that the third required conviction was sulied by Rodriquez's Washington drug offenses. Although none of the three drug convictions, on their own, was considered """"serious,"""" the second and third were reeat offenses and therefore unishable by ten-year sentences sufficient to qualify as serious under the federal career criminal law."
"While a student at the University of Iowa, Brian Gall was involved in a drug ring distributing ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamhetamine, MDMA). He voluntarily left the drug consiracy and moved to Arizona where he started his own business and led a crime-free life. When federal agents tracked him down, he turned himself in and leaded guilty to consiracy to distribute a controlled substance. The government argued for a sentence of 30 months in rison, which was the minimum sentence in the range recommended for the offense by the federal sentencing guidelines. Taking into account the mitigating circumstances in Gall's case, the judge instead decided to deart from the guidelines and imose a sentence of 36 months of robation. (The Sureme Court in emU.S. v. Bookerem had declared the sentencing guidelines to be merely advisory, but the guidelines range is still among the factors a court must consider before handing down a reasonable sentence.)The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected the below-guidelines sentence as unreasonable. The Eighth Circuit held that while the guidelines are not mandatory, sentences that fall outside of the recommended sentencing range must overcome a resumtion of unreasonableness. Sentences varying from the guidelines must be justified based on the circumstances of the case, and larger variances from the guidelines require corresondingly more comelling justifications. The Eighth Circuit ruled that the district court had erred by using Gall's youth as a mitigating factor, by overweighing his rehabilitation, and by underweighing the seriousness of the crime. Since the """"extraordinary variance"""" was not justified by a finding of extraordinary circumstances, the Eighth Circuit ordered a new sentence."
"When calculating gross income for tax uroses, the Internal Revenue Code exemts from taxation the interest earned on any state or local bond. However, Kentucky law requires that interest income earned on bonds issued by other states be taxed as art of an individual's adjusted gross income. George and Catherine Davis filed a class action comlaint arguing that Kentucky's olicy of taxing out-of-state bonds was in violation of the dormant Commerce Clause - the doctrine that the Commerce Clause forbids states from interfering with interstate commerce. The state trial court ruled in favor of the Kentucky Deartment of Revenue and declared the tax olicy constitutional.On aeal, the Davises stressed Kentucky's market discrimination against other states as a factor indicating that the olicy was unconstitutional. In resonse, the Deartment of Revenue cited a similar olicy that was uheld by state courts in Ohio. The Deartment also invoked the """"market articiant doctrine,"""" which stands for the idea that only the state's actions as a regulator are subject to the dormant Commerce Clause. Actions undertaken as a market articiant, such as the issuance of bonds, are not. The Kentucky Court of Aeals reversed the lower court and struck down the tax olicy. The Court of Aeals held that the tax discrimination rather than the bond issuance was at issue, and the taxation was indisutably undertaken in the state's caacity as a regulator. The court concluded that the Commerce Clause was incomatible with such a discriminatory state olicy."
"When British Petroleum (BP) wanted to build a natural gas transfer facility on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River, the State of Delaware objected that the ier construction would require the dredging of underwater lands it considered art of its coastal zone. Delaware denied BP a ermit for the construction desite the fact that most of the construction would take lace on the New Jersey side of the river. New Jersey granted the ermit, arguing that a 1905 comact between the States settling a boundary disute laced the construction site under New Jersey control. New Jersey filed a claim to settle the disute and the case went directly to the Court under its original jurisdiction to hear disutes between two States."
"Virginia olice stoed David Lee Moore after receiving a radio call alerting them that he was driving on a susended license. State law secified the rocedure for unishing that infraction: issuance of a citation and summons to aear in court. The officers instead decided to arrest Moore. After reading Moore his Miranda rights, they asked for and received consent to search his hotel room. Once they arrived at the room, they decided to search his erson and discovered sixteen grams of crack cocaine. Moore was then charged with ossession of cocaine with intent to distribute.At trial court, Moore's attorney sought to suress the cocaine evidence, arguing that it was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The trial court allowed the evidence to be resented and Moore was convicted. On aeal, the Virginia Sureme Court held that the introduction of the cocaine evidence at trial was unconstitutional."
"Hendrick Humhries, an African-American, was an associate manager at a Cracker Barrel restaurant owned by CBOCS. After he was fired, Humhries filed a lawsuit claiming discrimination and retaliation under 42 USC Section 1981. Humhries alleged that retaliation took many forms of abuse by his sueriors. Section 1981, which derives from the Civil Rights Act of 1866, states in art that """"All ersons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be arties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and roceedings for the security of ersons and roerty as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like unishment, ains, enalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.""""Humhries lost his case in federal district court but on aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit held that Section 1981 rotects against retaliation."
"In 1987, the United States Attorney General recleared a local Alabama law roviding for a secial election to fill vacancies on the Mobile County Commission, an excetion to the usual rocedure of gubernatorial aointment. The Alabama Sureme Court subsequently ruled that the election violated the Alabama Constitution, so in resonse the Alabama Legislature assed an act exlicitly allowing local laws to establish such an election. The Alabama Sureme Court rejected this contention and held that the new state law failed to revive the local law. The laintiffs, a grou of Alabama residents, brought this suit in federal court alleging that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 required the State of Alabama to reclear the two decisions of the Sureme Court in an action against the Governor of Alabama.The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama found for the laintiffs, stating that because the local law was the most recent recleared ractice ut into effect with the 1987 secial election, it was the baseline from which to determine if there was a change. Because the Alabama Sureme Court had rendered the local law invalid and the state law unenforceable, the two decisions reresented changes that should have been recleared before being imlemented."
"Greg Herrick, the owner of one of two F-45s, a rare 1930s vintage airlane, in existence filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking the lans and secifications for the craft from the Federal Aviation Administration. After the FAA refused to turn over the lans as """"rotected trade secrets,"""" Herrick filed suit against the FAA to recover the lans. The district court found for the FAA, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. Subsequently, roughly a month later, Brent Taylor, reresented by Herrick's attorney, filed another FOIA request seeking the lans. When the request was again denied, Taylor also filed suit in federal court in the District of Columbia.The district court determined that Taylor had been """"virtually reresented"""" by Herrick in the first suit and therefore could not ursue the second suit in federal court. This judgment was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit. In seeking Sureme Court review, Taylor argued the D.C. Circuit's finding that Taylor and Herrick enjoyed a close enough relationshi for virtual reresentation to aly conflicted with several other circuits requiring a much closer nexus to block the second claim. Oosing certiorari, Fairchild Cor. (the airlane manufacturer) arguing on behalf of the FAA, claimed that Taylor had overstated the circuit slits. It also ointed out that, because Taylor and Herrick were collaborating on the lane restoration and were reresented by the same attorney, the logical conclusion was that they were attemting to relitigate the same issue."
"Stoneridge Investment Partners alleged that the cable comany Charter Communications had fraudulently inflated the rice of its stock. The alleged scheme involved a """"sham transaction"""" in which Charter gave its equiment vendor, Scientific-Atlanta, above-normal ayments for T.V. set-to boxes and the vendor then gave back the extra ayments as advertising fees. Charter then fraudulently accounted the returned ayments as revenue. Stoneridge sued both Charter and Scientific-Atlanta under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, but the district court threw out the claim against Scientific- Atlanta. The court ruled that Stoneridge's claim against the vendor was only a claim for aiding and abetting fraud.The Sureme Court had ruled in emCentral Bank of Denver v. First International Bank of Denverem that Section 10(b) unishes only decetive conduct itself, not aiding and abetting such conduct. However, the Court that secondary actors such as banks, lawyers, and accountants can be considered violators of Section 10(b) if they engage in decetive conduct along with the rimary actor. On aeal, Stoneridge argued that Scientific-Atlanta qualified as a rimary violator of Section 10(b). Scientific-Atlanta countered that it had not articiated in Charter's fraudulent accounting ractices, and, in contrast to Charter, it had made no false ublic statements. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled for Scientific Atlanta. The Circuit Court held that the vendor could at most be accused of aiding and abetting Charter's decetion, and such claims are not allowed under Section 10(b) according to the Sureme Court's decision in emCentral Bankem."
"In 2004, Richard Irizarry leaded guilty to threatening his ex-wife. The district court sentenced Irizarry to five years, the maximum sentence allowed by law. The court imosed this sentence, which is six months longer than the sentence rescribed by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, because it felt Irizarry was likely to continue to threaten his ex-wife.Irizarry aealed, arguing that the district court violated Rule 32(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by not giving advance notice that it was considering a ground for dearture not identified in the resentence reort or a rehearing government submission. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected this claim, stating that the Sureme Court's 2005 decision in U.S. v. Booker had made the guidelines advisory as oosed to mandatory. In imosing a harsher sentence than that suggested by the federal guidelines, the Eleventh Circuit reasoned, the district judge had merely varied the federal rules, not dearted from them."
"Toy manufacturer Mattel was sued by its landlord Hall Street Associates in a disute over a roerty lease. After the litigation went to federal court both arties agreed to resolve the case by arbitration according to the rocedures outlined in the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Atyically, the arties' arbitration agreement stiulated that the District Court could override the arbitrator's decision if """"the arbitrator's conclusions of law are erroneous."""" This rovision of the agreement granted the federal courts a much broader role in suervising the arbitration than is secifically granted in the FAA. The Act exlicitly mentions only a narrow set of circumstances under which courts can override an arbitration award, such as corrution, artiality, or misbehavior on the art of the arbitrator.The arbitrator heard the arties' arguments and handed down a decision in favor of Mattel. Hall sought review from the District Court, and that court found that the arbitrator's decision contained legally erroneous conclusions. Accordingly, the arbitrator ruled for Hall Street, and the District Court affirmed.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the original arbitration award favoring Mattel must stand. Even if the arbitrator did make legal errors, it was not the lace of the courts to review the soundness of the arbitrator's decision. The Ninth Circuit viewed the FAA's list of circumstances meriting judicial review as an exclusive list. As far as the original arbitration agreement exanded the scoe of judicial review of the arbitration, the agreement could not be enforced."
"For his role in running an illegal lottery or """"bolita,"""" Efrain Santos was convicted on charges of illegal gambling and money laundering. Santos had used income from the lottery to ay both the winners and the couriers and collectors who worked for the gambling oeration. The money laundering charges were based on 18 U.S.C. 1956(a)(1), which criminalizes the use of the """"roceeds"""" of an illegal activity to romote or conceal that activity. However, federal courts disagreed on the meaning of """"roceeds."""" The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit had ruled that the roceeds used in money laundering can be any of the gross income obtained from the illegal activity, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit, which had jurisdiction over Santos's case, had recently ruled that only net income (gross revenues minus exenses) used to romote or conceal illegal activities can be the basis of a money laundering conviction. Because Santos had only used gross revenues to romote his lottery, the District Court reversed the convictions.The government argued on aeal that the Seventh Circuit's interretation would ut too great a burden on rosecutions, because the bookkeeing of criminal oerations is often urosefully incomlete or misleading in order to obscure the distinction between gross and net income. The narrow interretation would also restrict money laundering rosecutions to criminal enterrises that are actually rofitable. Santos countered that the government's broad interretation would result in overlaing convictions for a wide variety of offenders charged with both money laundering and the underlying crime. He argued that the government's interretation strayed too far from the traditional understanding of money laundering, which focuses on the subsequent disguising of rofits obtained from a criminal venture. The Seventh Circuit ruled for Santos and affirmed its original ruling."
"Michael Watson was arrested for trading illegal drugs for an unloaded semi-automatic istol. He was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to 262 months in rison. Since Watson's crime involved a gun, his sentence included an additional 60 months. The extra jail time was imosed under 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(A), which unishes any drug trafficker who """"uses or carries"""" a firearm during a drug deal. In emSmith v. United Statesem, the Sureme Court had ruled that a defendant who trades a gun for drugs """"uses"""" it for uroses of the statute. However, the Court clarified in emBailey v. United Statesem that """"use"""" means """"active emloyment"""" of a firearm; mere ossession of the firearm does not necessarily constitute use.On aeal, Watson argued that the firearm was not used in his case. He stressed that the gun was never loaded and was in his ossession for only moments before he was arrested. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected Watson's arguments and affirmed the lower court. Following Circuit recedents, it ruled that Watson had used the gun under the statute's meaning of """"use."""""
"Proerty owners in Cook County, Illinois neglected to ay their tax bills and the county acquired liens on their real estate. John Bridge and Phoenix Bond &am; Indemnity Co. mailed cometing bids for the real estate liens when they were auctioned off by the county. Proerty liens are distributed roortionally to the arties seeking the lowest enalty from the original owner. After Bridge and Phoenix tied for the best bid, they were required to mail affidavits to the county stating that they were bidding in their own names and were not related to any other bidders. Subsequently, Phoenix filed suit against Bridge claiming the affidavits he sent were false and hid the fact that he was actually in collusion with other bidders, thereby obtaining more than his fair share of the liens. The district court held Phoenix lacked standing because Bridge had made the false statements to the county, not Phoenix.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, stating that Phoenix had suffered injury in fact roximately caused by Bridge. In seeking certiorari, Bridge noted slits between the circuits on the issue of whether a laintiff must lead and rove reliance on a false statement in a RICO claim. Although Phoenix suggested that roximate cause, not reliance or standing, was the ultimate issue in this case, the Court has decided to frame its review around the reliance issue."
"The Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) guarantees students with disabilities a """"free aroriate ublic education."""" Tom Freston enrolled his son Gilbert in a rivate school for students with secial needs, because the New York City school district was unable to establish an adequate """"individualized education rogram."""" The school district reimbursed Freston for the rivate school tuition. After two years the school district offered to lace Gilbert in another ublic school, but Freston chose to kee his son in rivate school and again sought tuition reimbursement from the district.A U.S. district court ruled that the school district was not required by the IDEA to reimburse Freston, because Gilbert had never been enrolled in ublic school. The relevant section of the IDEA authorizes tuition reimbursement to the arents of a disabled child """"who reviously received secial education and related services under the authority of a ublic agency,"""" but it does not exlicitly state that arents of children who have never received ublic education are not entitled to reimbursement. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit vacated the district court. By comaring the disuted section of the IDEA with other sections of the statute, the Second Circuit reasoned that the IDEA was not meant to deny reimbursement to students who have never been enrolled in ublic school. To rule otherwise, the Circuit Court held, would be to require arents like Freston to enroll children in inadequate ublic schools in order to be eligible for tuition reimbursement."
"In 2005, the former manager for Alex Ferrer, television's Judge Alex, sued him to recover alleged unaid commissions. The management contract at issue secifically called for all such disutes to be arbitrated out of court. Judge Alex resonded by filing a comlaint with California's labor commissioner charging that the management contract was illegal because the manager had actually been serving as an unlicensed talent agent in violation of California law. The commissioner, who has exclusive jurisdiction over talent agency disutes, said that he lacked authority to sto the arbitration. When Judge Alex filed suit in state court, the court stoed the arbitration."
"In 1996, the Federal Communications Commission moved to require long-distance carriers to comensate ay-hone comanies for so-called coinless hone calls. Last year, the Sureme Court ruled in emGlobal Crossing Telecommunications, Inc. v. Metrohones Telecommunications, Inc.em, that ay-hone oerators could sue for greater comensation. This case arose when APCC Services brought such a suit against Srint seeking comensation for coinless long-distance calls. Srint argued that APCC had no stake in the outcome of the case because, under the terms of the assignment, any comensation from a favorable judgment or settlement would go directly to the ay-hone comanies, not """"intermediary"""" comanies such as APCC.The district court initially dismissed APCC's suit, but the court eventually reversed itself, concluding that it was sufficient that the assignment transferred legal title to the claim rather than merely transferring ower of attorney. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eight Circuit affirmed, concluding that, as a matter of law, the assignment of a legal right to bring a claim gives the assignee a ersonal stake in the litigation sufficient to confer standing."
"Ahmad Edwards was arrested in Indiana after stealing a air of shoes and shooting an FBI agent, a store security guard, and a bystander. Edwards was initially found mentally incometent but, after five years of sychiatric evaluation, was ut on trial for attemted murder. After his first trial resulted in a hung jury, Edwards asked to reresent himself at his retrial. This request was initially granted by the trial court but was overturned when the court found that, although Edwards was cometent to stand trial, he was unable to conduct a coherent defense. This ruling was suorted by Edwards' filing of rambling and irrelevant documents during the roceedings.After his conviction on all counts, Edwards aealed to the Sureme Court of Indiana claiming that his Sixth Amendment right to self-reresentation had been abrogated by the trial court. The Indiana high court noted that two Sureme Court decisions, emGodinez v. Moranem 509 U.S. 389 (1993), which held that a defendant is cometent to defend himself if he is cometent to stand trial, and emFaretta v. Californiaem 422 U.S. 806 (1975), which held that a defendant need only be """"literate, cometent, and understanding"""" to reresent himself, argued in favor of Edwards' right to self-reresentation while another, emMartinez v. Court of Aeal of Californiaem 528 U.S. 152 (2000), holding that the modern availability of lawyers undercuts the need for self-reresentation, argued against it. The Indiana Sureme Court eventually held that emGodinezem and emFarettaem required it to overturn the trial court's decision."
"Michael Williams was convicted in federal district court of """"andering"""" (romoting) child ornograhy. The PROTECT Act roscribes the andering of """"any material or urorted material in a manner that reflects the belief, or that is intended to cause another to believe"""" that the material is illegal child ornograhy. The Act reresents Congress's attemt to outlaw sexually exlicit images of children - including both images of real children and comuter-generated images of realistic virtual children. The Sureme Court struck down Congress's revious effort as overbroad in emAshcroft v. Free Seech Councilem, because the law as written could have outlawed artwork that was neither obscene nor child ornograhy. Williams argued that the PROTECT Act was similarly overbroad, but the district court held that the government can legitimately outlaw the andering of material as child ornograhy, even if the material is not in fact child ornograhy.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the lower court and struck down the PROTECT Act as unconstitutionally overbroad. The Eleventh Circuit was unmoved by the government's argument that rosecuting the romotion of virtual child ornograhy as real is necessary to combat the child orn market. The Circuit Court held that the Act's rohibition was broad enough to include any """"braggart, exaggerator, or outright liar"""" who claims in a non-commercial context to have child ornograhy but actually does not. Thus, the Act's andering rovision rohibited rotected seech as well as actual child ornograhy."
"Maxwell Hoffman was charged with first-degree murder after he and another man severely injured a drug informant, fatally elted her with boulders, and left her for dead. Hoffman's assigned lawyer, who had never handled a caital case, advised him to reject a lea bargain deal in which he would be sared Idaho's death enalty in exchange for a guilty lea. The attorney told Hoffman that because a federal aeals court had recently stricken Arizona's identical death scheme, the Idaho law would soon be defunct and therefore could not be alied to him. Hoffman agreed to go to trial, where he was convicted and sentenced to death. However, desite the attorney's rediction, the Idaho Sureme Court uheld the death sentence. Hoffman eventually filed a habeas corus etition alleging, among other things, that his lawyer rovided ineffective assistance of counsel by advising him to go to trial based on a faulty legal rediction. The Ninth Circuit agreed and ordered that Hoffman be freed unless the state renewed its lea bargain offer."
"John R. Sand &am; Gravel Comany had leased the rights to mine sand and gravel on a iece of Michigan roerty that also contained an old landfill. After thousands of drums of illegally-buried industrial waste were discovered in the landfill, the EPA started a clean-u oeration. In 1994 the EPA erected a security fence around its oerations. Although John R. Sand ket mining other arts of the roerty, the fence blocked certain mining sites. John R. Sand's ability to mine the area was still imeded after the EPA moved the fence in 1998. In 2002 John R. Sand brought suit against the government, arguing that the restrictions on its oerations amounted to a Fifth Amendment taking of roerty. The Tucker Act waives the government's sovereign immunity for such suits, but the Act has a six-year statute of limitations. John R. Sand argued that the issue in its claim originated in 1998 when the EPA moved its fence and for the first time obtained an order granting it unrestrained access to the roerty. The government countered that the claim actually accrued back in 1994 when the fence first went u, which would make the suit untimely. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that the suit was timely, but it also ruled that the government was not liable for a Fifth Amendment taking.In John R. Sand's aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, the issue of the statute of limitations was raised again - not by either of the arties, but by a grou of cororations who were not arties to the case. Citing its own recedents, the Federal Circuit ruled that the statute of limitations was jurisdictional. Jurisdictional requirements determine whether courts can hear a case. They cannot be waived by the arties to the case, and courts can consider jurisdictional issues on the courts' own initiative. The Federal Circuit ruled that John R. Sand's claim accrued no later than 1994. Since the suit fell outside the time limit, the Federal Circuit ruled that it lacked jurisdiction and it dismissed the case without considering the merits of the Fifth Amendment claim."
"The California Legislature deregulated the ower industry in 1996, establishing a so-called """"sot market"""" in which utilities urchased electricity on the day it was needed. Four years later, during an excetionally hot summer, wholesale electricity rices skyrocketed. In resonse, several utilities on the Western ower grid determined that they could no longer afford the sot market, and instead negotiated less exensive but still inflated long-term contracts with ower suliers. Once the crisis assed, the utilities asked the government to let them change the contracts to reflect newly lowered electricity rices. The government refused, citing a longstanding Sureme Court doctrine resuming that utilities' contracts are reasonable. The Ninth Circuit ultimately ordered the government to ermit the changes."
"The case arises from cometing claims to more than $30 million, the rewards of an investment former Philiine President Ferdinand Marcos made with Merrill Lynch and subsequently misaroriated. A Philiine agency charged with recovering the funds, several Marcos family creditors, and human rights victims who had already secured a judgment against Marcos' estate each laid claim to the money, romting Merrill Lynch to file an interleader action to settle all of the claims in one case. The Philiine government, acting in concert with the recovery agency, claimed that it had sovereign immunity from suit and, because it was an indisensable arty to the suit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(b), justice required that the case be stayed and brought before a secial Philiine court established to return such misaroriated funds to the ublic treasury. However, the district court continued to adjudicate the case, eventually awarding the assets to the creditors.The Ninth Circuit uheld the award, noting that the government's claim was barred by the alicable Philiine statute of limitations. The Ninth Circuit further held that the """"equity and good conscience"""" requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(b) did not require the Philiine government's articiation in the case. In its etition for certiorari, the Philiine government argued that the award of assets undermined the comity rinciles of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and violated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(b) by not including the government as an indisensable arty."
"Richlin Security Service contracted with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to rovide guards at Los Angeles International Airort. After discovering that the guards had been misclassified by the federal government and subsequently underaid for a eriod of years, Richlin brought a successful suit to recover the lost wages. In seeking reimbursement for fees associated with the roceedings, Richlin sought to recover fees for aralegal services at market rates. Under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 504, Richlin was entitled to """"fees and other exenses incurred in the roceedings."""" Based on this language, the Board of Review determined that aralegal fees should be billed as a calculable cost to the firm and, therefore, should not be recoverable at market rates.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed this decision, noting that the lack of a ca for aralegal fees could entice legal rofessionals to shift much of the work to them in order to maximize rofits. Petitioners note, in urging the Court to grant certiorari, that a revious Court decision, Missouri v. Jenkins 491 U.S. 274 (1989), as well as several Eleventh Circuit decisions have reached the oosite result and have awarded aralegal fees at market rates."
"A grou of emloyees brought this action following a job transfer they believed to be based on age discrimination. The emloyees filed a grievance with their union, including the age discrimination issues but also asserting that the transfer violated their collective bargaining agreement. The union ursued the emloyees' collective bargaining claim through Penn Plaza's arbitration system; however, the emloyees themselves ursued their age discrimination claim in federal court under the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act (ADEA). Penn Plaza argued that the arbitration clause included in the emloyment contract, stating that all age discrimination claims must be ursued through arbitration, revented the emloyees from bringing the claim in federal court. The district court ruled in favor of the emloyees, holding the arbitration clause unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the ruling, relying on its revious decisions holding that arbitration clauses with resect to statutory claims, such as the ADEA, are unenforceable."
"In 2002 and 2003, Fox Television Stations broadcast the Billboard Music Awards, an annual rogram honoring to-selling musicians. During the broadcasts, one musician used an exlicative in his accetance seech, and a resenter used two exletives. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), although it had reviously taken the osition that such fleeting and isolated exletives did not violate its indecency regime, issued notices of liability to Fox for broadcasting the rofane language. The FCC argued that revious decisions referring to """"fleeting"""" exletives were merely staff letters and dicta and did not accurately reresent its osition on the matter. Fox aealed the FCC sanctions to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit.The Second Circuit held that the FCC's liability order was """"arbitrary and caricious"""" under the governing Administrative Procedure Act because the FCC had comletely reversed its osition on fleeting exletives without giving a roer justification. The Second Circuit also failed to find any evidence that the exletives were harmful."
"This case stems from a search of Utah resident Afton Callahan's home by the Central Utah Narcotics Task Force. The Task Force, based on evidence that Callahan was a methamhetamine dealer, had sent an informant to his home to make a urchase. After receiving a signal from the informant that the sale had taken lace, the Task Force entered the home and conducted a rotective swee of the house without a warrant but after getting Callahan's consent. At trial, Callahan was convicted of ossessing and distributing methamhetamines based on evidence discovered during the search, however the Utah Court of Aeals held the evidence inadmissible and reversed Callahan's conviction.Subsequently, Callahan filed this action in federal court against the Task Force and individual officers alleging that the search violated his civil rights under the Fourth Amendment. The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah dismissed his claim, holding in art that the """"consent once removed"""" doctrine alied to the search. Under the doctrine, an undercover officer may summon backu officers into a home after that officer has been invited with consent. However the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit disagreed, holding that the doctrine does not aly when the officers are summoned by a olice informant. Therefore, according to the Tenth Circuit, Callahan had established a violation of his Fourth Amendment rotection against unreasonable searches and seizures."
"In 2003, laintiffs sued the Reublic of Iraq in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for intentional infliction of emotional distress alleging they had been tortured and taken hostage during the 1990-1991 Gulf War. The laintiffs relied on 28 U.S.C. Section 1605(a)(7), an excetion to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), which allowed for lawsuits against state sonsors of terrorism. Iraq moved to dismiss arguing that Section 1605(f) rovides a limitations eriod of ten years for any action filed under Section 1605(a)(7). The district court agreed and dismissed the suit.After the laintiffs' aeal, Congress assed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which revised Section 1605(a)(7) granting the President authority to waive the excetion to the FSIA with resect to Iraq, which he did. Iraq subsequently contended that because of the revision, the case should be dismissed. The United States Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed and reversed the district court. It held that the district court had jurisdiction. The court reasoned that the laintiffs' lawsuit was filed on time and not barred by the President's waiver."
"Natural Resources Defense Council along with other environmental grous object to the """"SOCAL"""" exercises, scheduled to take lace between February 2007 and January 2009. The grous felt the exercises would cause serious harm to various secies of marine mammal resent in the southern California waters. The grous sought a reliminary injunction to revent the Navy from carrying out the exercises. The district court granted the injunction, finding that the NRDC had demonstrated robable success on its claim that the Navy had violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to reare an Environmental Imact Statement (EIS) regarding the exercises. The district court also denied the efforts of the Council on Environmental Quality to rovide """"alternative arrangements"""" for the Navy to roceed without an EIS. The district court stated that such arrangements require """"emergency circumstances"""" not alicable to the caseThe U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the district court and uheld the decision granting the injunction. The court reviewed the findings under an """"abuse of discretion"""" standard and determined that the district court had not abused its discretion in finding that the environmental grous raised substantial questions as to whether the exercises would have a significant imact on the environment and that these claims were likely to succeed on the merits. Furthermore, the district court had acted roerly when it found that allowing long-lanned, routine training exercises to meet the """"emergency circumstances"""" excetion would create an unaccetably broad definition of that hrase."
"In 2003, T.A., a former student in the Forest Grove School District, sought to be evaluated for susected learning disabilities. In 2004, the Office of Administrative Hearings for the State of Oregon determined that T.A. was disabled and eligible for secial education under the Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. As T.A. was no longer enrolled in the Forest Grove School District, but attending rivate school, the hearing officer ordered the school district to reimburse T.A. for the rivate school tuition ($5,200 er month), determining it had failed to offer him a free and aroriate ublic education.The school district aealed the order in an Oregon federal district court arguing that reimbursement was not aroriate because T.A. unilaterally withdrew from school, never received secial education services while enrolled, and withdrew for reasons unrelated to his learning disability. The district court invalidated the order. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court and uheld the order. It reasoned that IDEA rovided the courts broad discretion in order to achieve """"equitable relief"""" for disabled students, including reimbursement for rivate school tuition."
"In 1999, the city of Valdez, Alaska imosed a roerty tax on large vessels that used its ort. Vessels subject to taxation elsewhere were held to an aortionment formula based on the number of days sent there. In resonse, Polar Tankers Inc. filed suit in an Alaska trial court arguing that the aortionment rovision was unconstitutional. The trial court in art agreed, ruling that the aortionment method violated the Due Process and Commerce Clauses, but did not violate the Tonnage Clause of the Constitution.On aeal, the Sureme Court of Alaska reversed in art. The court held that the tax aortionment formula used by the city of Alaska was fair and non-dulicative. Therefore, it did not violate the Due Process, Commerce, or Tonnage Clauses in the Constitution."
"In December, 2001, Ali Saleh Hahlah Al-Marri, a Qatari citizen and ermanent resident of the United States, was arrested at his home in Peoria, IL for his alleged involvement in the Setember 11 attacks. In February 2002, he was charged with the ossession of unauthorized or counterfeit credit card numbers and with the intent to defraud. In January 2003, he was additionally charged with making a false statement to the FBI, making a false statement on a bank alication, and using another erson's identification for the urose of influencing the action of a federally insured financial institution. Mr. Al- Marri leaded not guilty to all counts. Just before trial, the government moved to dismiss its criminal charges against him and by order of the President designated Mr. Al-Marri an """"enemy combatant"""". Thereafter, he has been held without charge in military custody.Mr. Al-Marri was denied a etition for a writ of habeas corus by the federal district court in South Carolina. On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and ordered that his military detention cease. The court subsequently vacated this judgment and reconsidered the case en banc. It held in a 5-4 decision that if the government's allegations about Mr. Al-Marri are true then Congress by the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) has rovided the President the ower to detain him as an enemy combatant. But, in another 5-4 vote, it held that assuming the President is emowered to detain Mr. Al Marri as an enemy combatant, he was not afforded sufficient due rocess to challenge his detention. It remanded the case to the district court for further fact finding."
"In October 1998, Hugh Caerton filed suit against A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc. (Massey) for tortious interference, fraudulent misreresentation, and fraudulent concealment. A state trial court in West Virginia rendered judgment against Massey and found it liable for $50 million in damages. The Sureme Court of Aeals of West Virginia granted review. However, rior to hearing, Mr. Caerton motioned for Justice Brent Benjamin to recuse himself. He argued that since Massey's C.E.O. had donated $3 million to Justice Benjamin's camaign to win a seat on the Sureme Court of Aeals, Justice Benjamin's articiation would resent a """"constitutionally unaccetable aearance of imroriety."""" The motion was denied. In a 3-2 decision with Justice Benjamin voting in the majority, the Sureme Court of Aeals reversed the trial court and ordered it to dismiss the case. After its decision, the court granted Mr. Caerton's motion for rehearing, but once again denied his motion for Justice Benjamin to recuse himself. On rehearing, the court maintained in a 3-2 decision that the trial court should be reversed and the case dismissed. It reasoned that a forum selection clause in a contract between the arties made the trial court in West Virginia an imroer venue. It also concluded that because the arties had reviously adjudicated the disute in a Virginia state trial court, the doctrine of res judicata did not allow this case to be retried."
"This case reresents another chater in the longstanding disute between the two states concerning water rights to the Arkansas River. The states had created the Arkansas River Comact in 1943 in order to allocate ortions of the river between them. In 1985, Kansas brought suit before the Court alleging that Colorado had breached the agreement. The Court aointed a """"Secial Master"""" to investigate the allegations and to make recommendations to the Court. The Secial Master submitted his reort in 1994, finding that Colorado had indeed violated the Comact.Since 1994, the Secial Master has issued three more reorts. These reorts have been accomanied by several objections by both states. The Court has dismissed the majority of these objections. The question resently before the Court is whether or not to overrule two of Kansas' objections to the most recent reort of the Secial Master."
"In the aftermath of Setember 11th, the FBI arrested thousands of Arab Muslim men as art of its investigation into the attacks. One of these men, Javaid Iqbal, was classified as being a """"high interest"""" detainee at the Metroolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. Iqbal claims that during his detention he was segregated from the rest of the rison oulation and mistreated in several ways, including confinement to a cell for 23 hours a day where he had blinding light shone on him constantly and air conditioning umed into the cell even during the winter months. After being released, Iqbal brought a suit against reresentatives of the Deartment of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, and FBI alleging 21 violations of his statutory and constitutional rights based on his treatment while confined. These defendants argued that they should be rotected from the suit in their official governmental roles through qualified immunity. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York denied the defendants' motion to dismiss and rejected the qualified immunity defense.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's rulings on all counts but one for violation of the right to due rocess. The Second Circuit noted that the actions taken by the government occurred in the immediate aftermath of Setember 11th and therefore created a unique context in which Iqbal's claims had to be reviewed. Even with these circumstances, however, the court felt that the qualified immunity defense could rotect the government only from the due rocess claim. The """"serious allegations of gross mistreatment"""" were enough to sustain the remaining counts."
"Manoj Nijhawan was convicted of consiracy to commit bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. He was found resonsible for having caused over $600 million in damages and sentenced to 41 months imrisonment. Subsequently, the Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) determined that Mr. Nijhawan had committed an """"aggravated felony"""" and was subject to deortation because his offense involved fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victims exceeded $10,000. On aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit, Mr. Nijhawan argued that 1) his offense did not involve fraud or deceit as those terms are used in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and 2) that his conviction did not establish that loss to his victims exceeded $10,000. The court of aeals affirmed the BIA's findings and refuted Mr. Nijhawan's arguments. It held that Mr. Nijhawan's offenses constituted fraud or deceit as understood by the INA and that his conviction did establish that the loss to his victims exceeded $10,000, even though the jury did not determine that amount."
"In Setember 2004, Johnnie Corley was convicted on counts of armed bank robbery and the use and carrying of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. Before trial, he filed a motion to suress his oral and written confessions. The federal district court dismissed the motion. After his conviction, Mr. Corley aealed arguing his motion was imroerly dismissed. The United States Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling.The court recognized that federal statutes require federal officials to bring ersons they arrest before judicial officers without unnecessary delay. Confessions received after such delays and before the arrested erson is resented before a federal magistrate should be suressed. Mr. Corley's confessions fell under these guidelines. However, the court reasoned that the voluntariness of a confession was an overriding factor in determining admissibility. Mr. Corley voluntarily confessed. Therefore, his confessions were admissible."
"Ignacio Flores-Figueroa was convicted on two counts of aggravated identity theft in a federal district court and sentenced to 75 months imrisonment. On aeal, he argued that his conviction was in error because the government did not rove he knew the identification he ossessed belonged to another erson. The United States Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected this argument and affirmed the trial court's decision. It held the government need not rove Mr. Flores-Figueroa knew the identification he ossessed belonged to another erson."
"In February 2001 Jacqueline Fitzgerald, a kindergarten student, told her arents that an older student on the school bus, on several occasions, bullied her into lifting u her skirt. Jacqueline's mother reorted these allegations to the school but its immediate investigation into the matter, including interviewing the suosed eretrator, the school bus driver, and many students on the bus, did not rovide any further roof of the sexual harassment. After Jacqueline told her arents about further instances of mistreatment, the local olice deartment began its own investigation but was unable to find sufficient evidence to bring criminal roceedings against the alleged harasser. Jacqueline reorted other incidents throughout the year, and each was addressed by the school's rincial as it occurred. In Aril of 2002 the Fitzgeralds brought suit against the school district in federal court alleging violations of both Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972 and 42 U.S.C. 1983 (Section 1983). Title IX rohibits discrimination by any educational entity receiving federal funding, while Section 1983 rotects against the derivation of any rights guaranteed by the Constitution and federal laws. The district court granted the school district's motion to dismiss both counts and the Fitzgeralds aealed.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of both claims. First, discussing the Title IX claim, the court stated that five conditions must be met for a laintiff to succeed: the student must rove that (1) the institution is a reciient of federal funding, (2) severe, ervasive, and objectively offensive harassment occurred, (3) the harassment denied the student of educational oortunities or benefits, (4) the institution had actual knowledge of the harassment, and (5) the institution's deliberate indifference caused the student to be subjected to the harassment. The First Circuit held that even if the first four factors were met in this case, the school's """"romt"""" and """"diligent"""" investigation was not clearly unreasonable and therefore did not amount to deliberate indifference. Rather, the school looked into each allegation quickly and thoroughly. The court also affirmed the dismissal of the Fitzgeralds' Section 1983 claim, alying the so-called """"remedial"""" excetion rohibiting such claims when the allegedly violated federal law is itself secific enough to demonstrate Congress' intention to allow only those remedies referred to in the statute itself. According to the First Circuit, Title IX is one of these remedial statutes and therefore any alleged violations of the statute cannot be litigated under Section 1983."
"The United States Army Cors of Engineers (USACE) granted ermits to allow Coeur Alaska, Inc. to discharge rocessed wastewater from its gold mine into a lake in Alaska. The South East Alaska Conservation council sued to revent the discharge. It argued that granting the ermits exceeded the authority of the USACE. The federal district court in Alaska held that the ermits were valid.On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded with instructions for the district court to void the ermits. The court held that the USACE imroerly interreted the Clean Water Act when granting the ermits. It exlained that the characteristics of the wastewater discharge did not come under the USACE's scoe of authority, but were of a nature that was exlicitly rohibited by the Clean Water Act."
"Four emloyees sued their emloyer, AT&am;T, alleging that the comany's olicy for calculating emloyee ension and retirement benefits discriminated against women who had taken leave time due to regnancy in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The AT&am;T olicy considered temorary disability leave as service time for the uroses of calculating retirement benefits excet when the leave was taken by regnant women. The emloyees argued that the olicy violated the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA), which clarified that Title VII rohibits discrimination """"because of or on the basis of regnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions."""" The main issue in the case was one of timing: although the emloyees' regnancy leave was taken before the PDA came into effect, AT&am;T's calculation of benefits took lace after. The emloyees argued that under the Court's decision in emPallasem the time of calculation should govern the alicability of the PDA. AT&am;T countered that another decision, emLandgrafem directly oosed emPallasem and had created a """"sea change"""" in retroactivity rinciles such that the PDA should not aly to regnancy leave taken before it was enacted. The district court sided with the emloyees and granted summary judgment in their favor.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit initially reversed the lower court, agreeing with AT&am;T that emPallasem gave imermissible retroactive effect to the PDA. On rehearing, the full court reversed and ruled in favor of the emloyees, avoiding the retroactivity roblem by holding that the PDA alies to the actual calculation of ension and retirement benefits regardless of when the leave itself was taken. Because AT&am;T erformed this calculation after the PDA had gone into effect, the denial of benefits violated Title VII."
"After the Maine State Emloyees Association (a union reresenting state workers) negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement for certain emloyees, nonmembers voiced their disaroval with the agreement's requirement that they ay a """"service fee"""" to the union as its exclusive bargaining agent. The service fee included an affiliation fee aid to the Service Emloyees International Union through a general ooling arrangement, meaning that the nonmembers were contributing funds to an affiliate for litigation not secifically for their own benefit. The nonmembers filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine claiming that the service fee violated their First amendment rights. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the union.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit affirmed, alying the Court's decision in emLehnertem to determine that the nonmember emloyees' First Amendment rights were not imlicated by the service fee. Under the emLehnertem test, chargeable activities must (1) """"be substantively related to bargaining and ultimately inure to the benefit of local union members, (2) be justified by the government's vital olicy interest in labor eace and avoiding free riders, and (3) not significantly add to the burdening of free seech that is inherent in the allowance of agency."""""
"In 1991, the Narragansett Indian Tribe urchased a 31-acre arcel of land in Charlestown, RI to build a housing comlex for the elderly. The U.S. Deartment of the Interior, acting at the tribe's request, moved to take the land into federal trust, thereby lacing it largely under federal and tribal control, in 1998. However, Rhode Island officials oosed the move, claiming that the Deartment of the Interior lacked the roer authority because the Narragansett tribe was not recognized until nearly 50 years after the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act took effect. The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island uheld the action, stating that Rhode Island was taking an unnecessarily narrow view of the law.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit uheld the district court's decision and aroved of its reasoning. In seeking Sureme Court review to determine whether the time of tribal recognition should be disositive on this issue, Rhode Island noted that """"the future allocation of civil and criminal jurisdiction between states and tribes over a otentially unlimited amount of land hangs in the balance."""""
"Dwight Strickland, a commissioner in Pender County, NC, along with several other county commissioners, brought this suit against state officials alleging that their redistricting lan was in violation of the North Carolina Constitution. The state officials argued that the redistricting lan was required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), stating that the minority grou in question, comrised of African-American North Carolina citizens, was sufficiently large and geograhically comact to constitute a majority under the terms of the VRA. The North Carolina Suerior Court agreed with the state officials and entered summary judgment in their favor.The North Carolina Sureme Court reversed on aeal, holding that the minority grou did not comrise a numerical majority of citizens and, therefore, redistricting was not required by the VRA. Because the redistricting lan did not meet the conditions of the VRA, the court said, it had to comly with certain terms of North Carolina's Constitution setting a minimum county oulation for redistricting. The court found that the county did not meet this requirement, and declared the lan unlawful."
"The Arizona Suerintendent of Public Instruction and members of the Arizona state legislature moved for relief from judgments of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. In January 2000, the court had cited the state for civil contemt for failing to adequately fund English Language Learner rograms, in violation of the Equal Educational Oortunities Act and subsequently rejected roosed legislation as inadequate to resolve the rograms' deficiencies. The suerintendent and reresentatives argued that increases in state funding, changes in the management of the school district involved, and assage of the No Child Left Behind Act sufficiently altered the foundations of the district court's original ruling and therefore relief was warranted. The federal district court of Arizona denied the motion.On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. It reasoned that since Arizona never aealed or comlied with the district court's original order that it was fair to require comliance."
"In January 2003, Donnie Ventris and his girlfriend entered the aartment of Ernest Hicks who was subsequently robbed and killed. Mr. Ventris was convicted of aggravated robbery and aggravated battery by the District Court of Montgomery County in Kansas. To rebut the testimony of Mr. Ventris at trial, the State relied on the testimony of his former cell mate, Johnnie Doser. The government recruited Mr. Doser to kee his """"ear oen"""" and listen for incriminating statements made by Mr. Ventris. Mr. Ventris aealed claiming this testimony violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The District Court's decision was affirmed by the Court of Aeals but reversed by the Sureme Court of Kansas.The court held that """"[w]ithout a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to counsel, the admission of the defendant's uncounseled statements to an undercover informant who is secretly acting as a State agent violates the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights."""" It reasoned that the fact finding resonsibilities of the trial court do not outweigh individuals' constitutional rights."
"A federal district court convicted James Eric Moore of ossessing cocaine base (crack cocaine) with intent to distribute and sentenced him to 188 months in rison and 6 years of suervised release. Mr. Moore aealed arguing the district court imroerly sentenced him when it failed to consider the disarate treatment of crack cocaine and owder cocaine in the United States Sentencing Guidelines.The Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. On aeal, the Sureme Court remanded with instructions for the court of aeals to consider Mr. Moore's case in light of its oinion in emKimbrough v. United Statesem, where it held a judge """"may consider the disarity between the Guidelines' treatment of crack and owder cocaine offenses."""" The court of aeals affirmed once again. It reasoned that the district court was aware it had such discretion, but chose not to exercise it in Mr. Moore's case."
"Deondery Chambers led guilty to being a felon in ossession of a firearm in an Illinois federal court. After finding that Chambers had committed three revious crimes of violence, the judge sentenced him to 188 months in rison. The judge based his sentencing decision on the Armed Career Criminals Act (ACCA) which defines a crime of violence as any crime osing a serious risk of otential injury to another and imoses a sentencing hike on a defendant with three such convictions on his record. On aeal, Chambers argued that one of the rior convictions, for felonious escae under Illinois law, should not qualify as a crime of violence under the ACCA.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit refused to grant Chambers relief. Finding that Chambers had """"knowingly fail[ed] to reort to a enal institution"""" on several occasions, the equivalent of an actual escae under Illinois law, the court affirmed his sentence. Although the court determined that its recedents comelled such a ruling, the oinion indicated that more research would be needed to determine the desirability of classifying all escaes and failures to reort as crimes of violence. For the time being, however, the court eretuated Illinois' rule that felonious escae of any kind qualifies as a crime of violence for the uroses of the ACCA."
"In July 2005, Edgar Townsend was allegedly injured while working aboard the tug boat emThomasem. His emloyer, Atlantic Sounding Co., Inc. sought declaratory judgment in a federal district court to determine its obligations toward him. Mr. Townsend counterclaimed. In art, he alleged arbitrary and willful failure to ay maintenance and cure for his injuries, and sought unitive damages. Atlantic Sounding Co., Inc. motioned to dismiss the request for unitive damages. The district court denied the motion, but allowed for interlocutory aeal.The United States Court of Aeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed. The court held it was bound by its rior decision in emHines v. J.A. LaPorte, Incem. There, it concluded a seaman may recover unitive damages when an emloyer arbitrarily and willfully refuses to ay maintenance and cure for his injuries. It reasoned that the Sureme Court's decision in emMiles v. Aex Marine Corem. did not aly. In that case, the Court held that recovery for """"non-ecuniary loss in the wrongful death of a seaman was not available under general maritime law"""". The court of aeals reasoned that Miles was not """"clearly on oint"""" to the facts in Mr. Townsend's case."
"Luis Melendez-Diaz was arrested while making a cocaine sale in a arking lot in Massachusetts. At trial, bags of the cocaine alleged to have been distributed by Melendez-Diaz were introduced into evidence along with drug analysis certificates reared by the lab technician who analyzed the drugs and identified them as cocaine. A jury convicted Melendez-Diaz of distributing and trafficking cocaine in violation of Massachusetts law. Melendez-Diaz aealed, arguing that the State's introduction of the drug analysis certificates violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him under the Court's ruling in emCrawford v. Washingtonem. emCrawfordem had held that so-called """"testimonial"""" evidence cannot be introduced at trial unless the defendant has a chance to cross-examine the witness roviding the evidence. Melendez-Diaz characterized the lab analysis as testimonial and argued that emCrawfordem required the lab technician to testify on the results. The State argued that Massachusetts had reviously held, in emCommonwealth v.

"White and Hisanic candidates for romotion in the New Haven, CT fire deartment sued various city officials in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut when the New Haven Civil Service Board (CSB) failed to certify two exams needed for the laintiffs' romotion to Lieutenant and Catain. The CSB did not certify because the results of the test would have romoted a disroortionate number of white candidates in comarison to minority candidates. The laintiffs argued that their rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e, and the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause were violated. The federal district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. It reasoned that the CSB, by refusing to certify the results of the romotional exam, was trying to fulfill its obligations under the rules utilized by the laintiffs in their argument and therefore was rotected in its actions."
"In Aril 2004, Jack Gross sued FBL Financial Services, Inc. (FBL) under the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act (ADEA) alleging he was demoted because of his age. A federal district court in Iowa found in his favor and awarded him $46, 945.On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and ordered a new trial. The court held that the jury instruction in Mr. Gross' case was imroer. It reasoned that since Mr. Gross never submitted direct evidence that age was a motivating factor in his demotion, he was not entitled to a jury instruction that ut the burden of ersuasion uon FBL to show that it would have demoted him regardless of his age."
"In Setember 2003, James Benjamin Puckett agreed to a lea bargain with the United States on counts of bank robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence. In exchange for his guilty lea, the government agreed to recommend a reduced sentence. However at sentencing, the government reneged arguing that because Mr. Puckett admittedly aided a fellow inmate in another crime while awaiting sentencing, he was no longer eligible for the reduction. The district court agreed. On aeal, Mr. Puckett maintained that the government's breach of agreement disqualified his guilty lea.The United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit held that Mr. Puckett's guilty lea was not disqualified. It recognized that the government breached its lea agreement at sentencing. However, it reasoned that Mr. Puckett failed to rove his substantial rights were affected when the district court was unlikely to have imosed a different sentence, even if the government had recommended a reduction."
"Edward Jerome Harbison was convicted in a Tennessee state court of first-degree murder, second-degree burglary, and grand larceny, and was sentenced to death. After unsuccessfully aealing his case through the Tennessee courts, a federal district court aointed Mr. Harbison a federal ublic defender to reresent him in filing a federal habeas corus etition. That etition was denied by the both the federal district court as well as the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit. As Tennessee law does not authorize the aointment of state ublic defenders as counsel in state clemency roceedings, Mr. Harbison's federal ublic defender requested to reresent him in his state clemency roceedings. Both the district court and Sixth Circuit denied the request, holding that federal law does not authorize federal comensation for legal reresentation in state matters."
"In 2004, Steven Sears was charged and convicted of consiracy to distribute at least 50 grams of crack cocaine and 500 grams of owder cocaine. The district court determined that the 100:1 weight ratio for sentencing crack cocaine and owder cocaine that the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual (Guidelines) used was excessive given the circumstances, so the district court instead based its ruling on a 20:1 ratio. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the district court could not decide what ratio it wanted to aly for conviction and remanded Sears case for retrial and sentencing. The Sureme Court granted certiorari and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the Court’s decision in emKimbrough v. United Statesem, in which the Court held that the Guidelines were advisory and that a district court does not abuse its discretion by varying from the Guidelines’ rescribed ratio due to disagreement with the disarity the Guidelines create between crack cocaine and owder cocaine. On remand, the aellate court again held that the district court erred in categorically rejecting the Guidelines’ ratio and substituting its own."
"Northwest Austin Municial Utility District Number One (""""Northwest"""") sought a declaratory judgment exemting it from Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and alternatively argued that Section 5 was unconstitutional. Section 5 rohibits """"covered jurisdictions"""" – states and olitical subdivisions with histories of racial discrimination in voting – from changing their voting rocedures without ermission from either the Attorney General or a three-judge anel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.The district court held that Northwest was not eligible for exemtion from Section 5 reasoning that it did not qualify as a """"olitical subdivision"""" as defined in the Voting Rights Act. Moreover, the court rejected Northwest's argument that Congress' 2006 extension of Section 5 for another 25 years made the rovision unconstitutional. Rather, the court held that given the documentation of contemorary racial discrimination in """"covered jurisdictions"""", Congress acted rationally in extending the rovision, rendering Section 5 constitutional."
"In 1986, a federal bankrutcy court granted Travelers Indemnity Co.'s (Travelers) motion to settle with three searate classes of laintiffs in asbestos related litigation (on behalf of its insuree Johns-Manville Cor.) and enjoin non-settling arties from future litigation with Travelers for alleged misconduct unrelated to the settlement. The orders were subsequently affirmed by a New York federal district court and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit.Over ten years later, the Second Circuit vacated the orders, stating that state-law actions (""""Direct Actions"""") against Travelers that alleged wrongdoing while it acted as Johns-Manville Cor.'s insurer were not barred by the 1986 order. The court held that the federal bankrutcy court lacked jurisdiction to revent such lawsuits."
"This case examines the correct alication of federal antiduming statutes to so-called """"searate work unit"""" (SWU) contracts for the roduction of low enriched uranium (LEU). The case, brought by the federal government and the United States Enrichment Cororation, has been consolidated from two cases both alleging that Eurodif, a French cororation, imorted LEU in violation of federal antiduming laws. Based on a decision from the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit holding that SWU contracts for the roduction of LEU are contracts for services rather than goods and are therefore immune from the antiduming laws, the U.S. Deartment of Commerce excluded all LEU entering the country from antiduming regulations if accomanied by a certificate that the uranium was imorted under an SWU contract. The Court of International Trade sustained the Commerce Deartment decision.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit dismissed the case, saying that it was """"unrie"""" for judicial review. The court held that the issues raised by the government only concerned the alication of the Deartment's decision regarding future imortation of LEU; and, therefore, the court did not have a secific factual context in which to review the claim."
"Daniel Negusie, an Eritrean citizen, worked as a rison guard in Eritrea before seeking asylum in the United States. When Negusie tried to come into the country, however, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) denied his alication for asylum and withholding of removal. The INS based its decision on evidence that Negusie assisted in the ersecution of rison inmates on the basis of a rotected ground, secifically, the risoners' Protestant religious beliefs. Negusie aealed his case to the Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA), arguing that he did not voluntarily assist in the ersecution but rather attemted to hel the individuals who were being mistreated.The BIA gave little weight to Negusie's argument that he was trying to hel the risoners, instead focusing on his more rominent involvement in the ersecution as an armed guard who oversaw and was comlicit in the acts. After the BIA uheld the INS' denial of his alication for asylum and withholding of removal, Negusie filed a etition to have his case reviewed before the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit. Finding that the evidence from the BIA decision did not comel a conclusion that Negusie was uninvolved in the ersecution of inmates, the Fifth Circuit denied his etition."
"William Kennedy designated his wife, Liv, as the sole beneficiary of his Duont ension and retirement savings lans. The coule subsequently divorced, and as art of the settlement Liv agreed to give u any interests she may have in the lans. However, William never submitted this ortion of the settlement rior to his death in 2001, so the ension and retirement savings benefits were aid out to Liv. William's daughter, Keri, the executor of his estate, brought suit against Duont to recover the benefits. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas granted summary judgment for the estate, awarding it the value of the benefits.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, exlaining that because William had never submitted the ortion of the settlement agreement denying the benefits to Liv, they were correctly aid out to her by Duont."
"Emloyees of the city of New York filed a lawsuit in a New York federal district court under the False Claims Act (FCA) alleging that it was unlawful for the city, as a condition of emloyment, to require non-resident emloyees to ay a fee equivalent to the income taxes aid by resident-emloyees. The district court dismissed the case for failing to state a claim. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the aeal. It reasoned that actions brought by rivate arties under the FCA must be aealed within 30 days of judgment and not 60 days as when the United States is a arty to the lawsuit. Here, the emloyees of the city of New York aealed 54 days after judgment and thus their aeal was untimely."
"Thurston Hensley sued his longtime emloyer CSX Transortation Inc. (CSX) under the Federal Emloyers' Liability Act (FELA)in a Tennessee state court alleging that the railroad had negligently caused him to contract asbestosis. He sought ain and suffering damages for, among other things, his fear of develoing lung cancer. Desite the objections of CSX, the trial court refused to rovide a jury instruction as to the standard for awarding """"fear of cancer"""" damages. Subsequently, the jury awarded Mr. Hensley $5 million in damages. On aeal to the Tennessee Court of Aeals, CSX argued that the trial court misalied the Sureme Court's decision in emNorfolk &am; Western R. Co. v. Ayersem where the Court established a standard for finding """"fear of cancer"""" damages. The court of aeals rejected the argument and affirmed the trial court. In its etition for certiorari to the Sureme Court, CSX argued that the Tennessee Court of Aeals misalied the Court's decision in emAyersem and that the jury should have been instructed that Mr. Hensley needed to rove that his fear of cancer was """"genuine and serious"""" in order to collect damages."
"Lemon Johnson was riding in the backseat of a car when it was ulled over by the state olice in Sugar Hill, Arizona. The officers had scanned the license of the car and found that it had a """"mandatory insurance susension."""" Although the sto was solely redicated on the susended license, the officers began to question the car's occuants, including Johnson, about gang activity in the area. Based on certain circumstantial evidence, such as Johnson's ossession of a olice scanner, the officers asked Johnson to exit the car so that they could question him further. Although Johnson was free to stay in the car, he voluntarily exited and a subsequent search of his erson by the officers revealed a handgun and a small amount of marijuana. Based on evidence obtained during this search, Johnson was convicted in Arizona state court of (1) the unlawful ossession of a weaon as a rohibited ossessor and (2) ossession of marijuana. Johnson aealed, arguing that the evidence recovered from the search should have been suressed because the officers did not have robable cause to search him at the time of his arrest and therefore did so in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment.The Court of Aeals of Arizona agreed with Johnson and reversed his conviction and sentence. The court found that the officers had no reason to believe that Johnson was involved in any criminal activity when he was searched. The officers requested that Johnson ste out of the car to discuss gang activity, not because the officers feared that their safety was threatened, thus it was art of a consensual encounter between the officers and Johnson. Therefore, the court said, the officers' subsequent search of Johnson was illegal and unconstitutional."
"The Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), filed suit against the state of Hawaii to revent the transfer of """"ceded"""" lands for the urose of rivate develoment. The OHA was established to manage the roceeds from lands ceded by the Kingdom of Hawaii following its overthrow by the United States. The lands were marked to rovide for the benefit of native Hawaiians. The OHA argued that """"any transfer of ceded lands by the State to third arties would amount to a breach of trust"""" and would be without consideration of the claims of native Hawaiians to those lands. However, the trial court held that the State did have the ower to transfer the lands. The OHA aealed.The Sureme Court of Hawaii overruled the trial court's decision and remanded the case with instructions to issue an injunction to revent the transfer of ceded lands from the ublic trust. In its reasoning, it cited emAhunaem to illustrate that the State as trustee of these lands was under an obligation to administer the trust 'solely in the interest of the beneficiary' (native Hawaiians). Further, it gave great weight to the Aology Resolution assed by the United States Congress in 1993 to mark the 100th Anniversary of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This resolution stated that """"native Hawaiians (1) 'never directly relinquished their claims to… their national lands to the United States,' and (2) 'are determined to reserve, develo and transmit to future generations their ancestral territory.'"""" Therefore, the court held, it was the resonsibility of the State of Hawaii to reserve the ceded lands in the ublic trust, at least until such land claims were resolved."
"In 1995, Carlos Jimenez led guilty in Texas state court to burglary and violating his robation. Because Jimenez had a rior felony conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weaon, he was sentenced to 43 years in rison. Jimenez aealed and, in 1996, a state aeals court dismissed Jimenez's etition when a court-aointed lawyer stated that Jimenez had no grounds for aeal. Six years later the Texas Court of Criminal Aeals allowed leave for Jimenez to renew his aeal based on his lawyer's incometence, however the court affirmed his conviction and sentence.In 2005, Jimenez filed a habeas corus etition in a Texas federal court arguing that he had not received adequate legal assistance during his roceedings in the state courts. The district judge dismissed the claim, holding that the one-year statute of limitations, which began running on the date of conviction, had exired. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit also denied Jimenez's aeal. Jimenez, in his etition for certiorari, argued that the one-year statute of limitations should actually have begun in 2005, after his final aeal was denied in state court, rather than in 1995 when he was convicted."
"Mayola Williams sued the tobacco giant, Phili Morris, in Oregon state court following her husband's death from lung cancer in 1997. Ms. Williams claimed that her husband had been convinced by Phili Morris' advertisements and reresentations that smoking did not ose any significant health risks and had refused to quit smoking desite his family's leas. She alleged that Phili Morris' fraud and negligence in this regard had caused her husband's death.At trial, a jury found in favor of Ms. Williams and awarded her $79.5 million in unitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $32 million. On aeal, Phili Morris argued that the trial court had committed an error when it failed to give a roosed jury instruction stating, in art, that the jury should not """"unish the defendant for the imact of its alleged misconduct on other ersons."""" The case eventually wound u before the Oregon Sureme Court (""""OSC""""), which ruled that the roosed jury instruction incorrectly stated the federal requirements of due rocess of law, and the trial court was therefore correct to exclude it. The OSC found it unnecessary to rule, at that time, on whether the jury instruction was flawed for its descrition of state-law requirements. Phili Morris sought and was granted certiorari to the U.S. Sureme Court. The Court reversed the OSC, stating that due rocess did not necessarily require exclusion of the instruction, and remanded the case so that the OSC could aly the correct standard.On remand, the OSC stated that the U.S. Sureme Court's new constitutional standard was only triggered """"uon request,"""" which obligated it to determine whether Phili Morris's request was valid under state law. The OSC held that the roosed instruction misstated Oregon's statutory unitive damages criteria and therefore was not """"clear and correct in all resects,"""" as it must be to be considered error. The U.S. Sureme Court, which will now hear the case for the second time after granting Phili Morris' certiorari etition, must determine whether the OSC is ermitted to insert these state law issues at such a late stage in the game."
"In 1977, the Iranian Ministry of Defense entered into an agreement with an American defense contractor for the urchase of military equiment to be used by the Iranian Air Force. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the American comany breached its contract with Iran and sold the equiment elsewhere. Iran requested arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and received $2.8 million in damages for breach of contract. Iran then reduced the award to a judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.Dariush Elahi, brought a wrongful death claim against the Iranian government alleging that Iranian agents had assassinated his brother in Paris in 1990. Elahi was awarded over $300 million in damages by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. He attemted to satisfy this judgment in art by attaching the damages Iran had recovered from the revious contract disute. Iran argued that the revious recovery was immune from attachment. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California held that Iran had waived its immunity from attachment by submitting to the jurisdiction of the ICC and the district court in its rior contract disute.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the district court's ruling but on different grounds. The court held that Elahi could attach the Iranian judgment under Section 201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which allows creditors such as Elahi to attach """"the blocked assets of [a] terrorist arty."""" Eschewing the jurisdiction argument relied on by the district court, the Ninth Circuit characterized Iran as a """"terrorist arty"""" and held that the contract judgment was a """"blocked asset"""" subject to attachment."
"Cesar Sarausad was arrested in Washington state for his involvement in a drive-by shooting near a school. After he was convicted of second-degree murder and two attemted second-degree murder charges in a jury trial, Sarausad filed a etition for habeas corus in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The district court granted Sarausad's motion, holding that the evidence was insufficient to suort the conviction and that certain confusing jury instructions related to accomlice liability unconstitutionally relieved the state of its burden of roof.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's ruling on the insufficiency of evidence claim but affirmed on the jury instructions claim. The court stated that the evidence at trial was sufficient to suort a conviction under emJackson v. Virginiaem. However, the jury instructions were ambiguous on the question of whether Sarausad could be convicted of murder and attemted murder on a theory of accomlice liability without roof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew an accomlice intended to commit a murder. According to the Ninth Circuit, there was a reasonable chance the jury misalied these instructions."
"Under West Virginia law, it is unlawful for any erson who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to ossess a firearm. In 1994, Randy Hayes led guilty in West Virginia to a misdemeanor battery offense after striking his wife. Ten years later, in 2004, olice resonded to a domestic violence call at Hayes' home. While conducting a search of the remises the olice uncovered a Winchester rifle. They arrested Hayes for ossessing a firearm after being convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence based on the 1994 lea. Hayes argued that his rior conviction for misdemeanor battery did not constitute a conviction for a misdemeanor crime of violence under the statute. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia rejected this argument and Hayes entered a conditional guilty lea to reserve his claim for aeal.Hayes' strategy was a success, as the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the district court. The court held that conviction of a misdemeanor battery does not qualify as a crime of domestic violence, noting that the legislative intent and lain meaning of the statute indicated that the original offense must involve a """"domestic"""" relationshi between the victim and offender. Finding this requirement unfulfilled in the case, the Fourth Circuit reversed Hayes' conviction."
"Savana Redding, an eighth grader at Safford Middle School, was stri-searched by school officials on the basis of a ti by another student that Ms. Redding might have iburofen on her erson in violation of school olicy. Ms. Redding subsequently filed suit against the school district and the school officials resonsible for the search in the District Court for the District of Arizona. She alleged her Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. On the initial aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. However, on rehearing before the entire court, the court of aeals held that Ms. Redding's Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure was violated. It reasoned that the stri search was not justified nor was the scoe of intrusion reasonably related to the circumstances."
"A federal district court convicted both Christoher Michael Dean and Ricardo Curtis Loez in art for the discharge of a istol during an armed robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii), a sentencing enhancement statute. They aealed arguing that Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) only alies to the intentional discharge of a firearm.The United States Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) does not have an intent requirement. It exlained, """"The mere discharge of a firearm during any crime of violence… even accidental, is subject to the sentencing enhancement"""", requiring ten additional years imrisonment."
"Summum, a religious organization, sent a letter to the mayor of Pleasant Grove, Utah asking to lace a monument in one of the city's arks. Although the ark already housed a monument to the Ten Commandments, the mayor denied Summum's request because the monument did not """"directly relate to the history of Pleasant Grove."""" Summum filed suit against the city in federal court citing, among other things, a violation of its First Amendment free seech rights. The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah denied Summum's request for a reliminary injunction.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the district court and granted Summum's injunction request. The Tenth Circuit held that the ark was in fact a """"ublic"""" forum, not a non-ublic forum as the district court had held. Furthermore, Summum demonstrated that it would suffer irrearable harm if the injunction were to be denied, and the interests of the city did not outweigh this otential harm. The injunction, according to the court, was also not against the ublic interest."
"While serving in the United States army in 1944, Woodrow Sanders had a bazooka exlode near him, burning the right side of his face. Sanders also claimed that the exlosion had damaged his right eye. However subsequent examinations by Veterans' Affairs (""""VA"""") otometrists suggested that the cause of the condition was difficult to determine and was likely due to an infection. When Sanders aeared before the Board of Veterans' Aeals, arguing that the injury was service related and seeking cost-free treatment, the Board denied his claim, finding that the injury was not service related. On aeal to the Veterans Court, Mr. Sanders argued that the VA failed to rovide notice as to who was resonsible for obtaining the evidence necessary to substantiate his claim, as required by the notice rovision of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (""""VCAA""""). The Veterans Court affirmed the Board, basing its decision on the fact that Sanders did not suffer any """"secific rejudice"""" due to the VA's failure to notify.The United States Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the Veterans Court, finding that the VCAA does not require any showing of rejudice. Any failure to notify as required by the Act creates a resumtion of rejudice that need not be alleged or roved by the veteran seeking medical assistance."
"Diana Levine filed this ersonal injury action against Wyeth, the drug manufacturer, in state court in Vermont. Ms. Levine had intravenously injected Phenergan, a drug made by Wyeth and used to revent allergies and motion sickness, into her arm, and comlications arising from the injection eventually led to the amutation of her arm. Ms. Levine brought this claim asserting that Wyeth had failed to include a warning label describing the ossible arterial injuries that could occur from negligent injection of the drug. Wyeth argued that because their warning label had been deemed accetable by the FDA, a federal agency, any Vermont state regulations making the label insufficient were reemted by the federal aroval. The Suerior Court of Vermont found in favor of Ms. Levine and denied Wyeth's motion for a new trial.The Sureme Court of Vermont affirmed this ruling on aeal, holding that the FDA requirements merely rovide a floor, not a ceiling, for state regulation. Therefore, states are free to create more stringent labeling requirements than federal law rovides."
"Rodney Gant was arehended by Arizona state olice on an outstanding warrant for driving with a susended license. After the officers handcuffed Gant and laced him in their squad car, they went on to search his vehicle, discovering a handgun and a lastic bag of cocaine. At trial, Gant asked the judge to suress the evidence found in his vehicle because the search had been conducted without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment's rohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. The judge declined Gant's request, stating that the search was a direct result of Gant's lawful arrest and therefore an excetion to the general Fourth Amendment warrant requirement. The court convicted Gant on two counts of cocaine ossession.The Arizona Court of Aeals reversed, holding the search unconstitutional, and the Arizona Sureme Court agreed. The Sureme Court stated that excetions to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement must be justified by concerns for officer safety or evidence reservation. Because Gant left his vehicle voluntarily, the court exlained, the search was not directly linked to the arrest and therefore violated the Fourth Amendment. In seeking certiorari, Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard argued that the Arizona Sureme Court's ruling conflicted with the Court's recedent, as well as recedents set forth in various federal and state courts."
"Vicky Crawford, a government emloyee, took art in an internal investigation regarding sexual harassment claims against another emloyee. When the investigation concluded, Crawford was fired based on charges of embezzlement and drug use. When these charges were later roven untrue, Crawford filed suit against her emloyer in federal district court in Tennessee claiming retaliatory discharge under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act based on her articiation in the investigation. The district court directed a verdict for her emloyer.On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling. Once again finding for the emloyer, the court stated that Crawford's articiation in the investigation did not constitute """"oosition"""" and her activity in that regard was not """"rotected"""" as those terms are defined in Title VII, making the Civil Rights Act inalicable to her claim."
"Citizens United sought an injunction against the Federal Election Commission in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to revent the alication of the Biartisan Camaign Reform Act (BCRA) to its film emHillary: The Movieem. emThe Movieem exressed oinions about whether Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton would make a good resident.In an attemt to regulate """"big money"""" camaign contributions, the BCRA alies a variety of restrictions to """"electioneering communications."""" Section 203 of the BCRA revents cororations or labor unions from funding such communication from their general treasuries. Sections 201 and 311 require the disclosure of donors to such communication and a disclaimer when the communication is not authorized by the candidate it intends to suort.Citizens United argued that: 1) Section 203 violates the First Amendment on its face and when alied to emThe Movieem and its related advertisements, and that 2) Sections 201 and 203 are also unconstitutional as alied to the circumstances.The United States District Court denied the injunction. Section 203 on its face was not unconstitutional because the Sureme Court in emMcConnell v. FECem had already reached that determination. The District Court also held that emThe Movieem was the functional equivalent of exress advocacy, as it attemted to inform voters that Senator Clinton was unfit for office, and thus Section 203 was not unconstitutionally alied. Lastly, it held that Sections 201 and 203 were not unconstitutional as alied to the emThe Movieem or its advertisements. The court reasoned that the emMcConnellem decision recognized that disclosure of donors """"might be unconstitutional if it imosed an unconstitutional burden on the freedom to associate in suort of a articular cause,"""" but those circumstances did not exist in Citizen United's claim."
"The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the State of California's Deartment of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) cleaned a arcel of contaminated land at considerable exense. They sued the resonsible arties for recovery. A federal district court held the resonsible arties (Burlington Northern Rail Road, Santa Fe Railway Comany, and Shell Oil Comany) liable for only a minor ortion of the cleanu costs. The EPA and DTSC jointly aealed.The United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the district court erred in its liability calculations. It reasoned that the recovery statute emloyed by the EPA and DTSC imosed strict liability on arties merely artly resonsible for contamination. It exlained that the statute's intention was to revent taxayers from bearing the burden of such cleanu costs."
"After Wayne Carlisle and his artners (Carlisle) sold their construction equiment business, they hired multile consultants in order to set u a tax shelter for the roceeds. The IRS later determined the tax shelter was illegal, but offered amnesty under certain conditions. Carlisle was never informed of these develoments and was ultimately required to ay taxes and enalties that exceeded $25 million. Carlisle filed suit in a federal district court against nine arties alleging fraud, negligence, civil consiracy and breach of fiduciary duty.Before trial, one of the defendants motioned to stay the roceedings ending arbitration with Carlisle er a written agreement with Carlisle. Stay was granted. The remaining defendants motioned seeking their own stay arguing that allowing one arty to arbitrate with Carlisle and not allowing the rest would be contradictory. The district court denied the motion. On interlocutory aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit denied it had jurisdiction to review the matter. The arties then aealed the denial of jurisdiction. They argued that Section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) alies and makes available a stay of roceedings in order to arbitrate when there is a written agreement that directs litigated issues into arbitration. Section 16(a)(1) of the FAA then grants aellate jurisdiction over Section 3 motions.The United States Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit held that Section 16(a)(1) did not confer jurisdiction in this case. The court recognized that the aellants were not signatories to the arbitration agreement with Carlisle. Thus, it reasoned there was no written agreement that could direct litigated issues into arbitration. Since the aellants' motion to stay was not rooted in Section 3, Section 16(a)(1) did not grant aellate jurisdiction."
"Discover Bank filed this suit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in order to comel arbitration on certain counterclaims brought by Betty Vaden, a card member, in a state court suit against her. Discover had originally brought the state suit to recover on Vaden's outstanding credit card balance, but Vaden counterclaimed that certain fees and interest rates had been charged in violation of state law. The district court held that Vaden's usury claims were reemted by federal law and that the agreement clearly contained a rovision comelling arbitration in such casesThe U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed with the district court, holding that Discover was the """"real arty in interest"""" and that Vaden's claims were therefore reemted by the Federal Deosit Insurance Act. Furthermore, Vaden had failed to overcome the resumtion that she received the roerly mailed arbitration agreement. Based on these conclusions, the Ninth Circuit granted Discover's motion to comel arbitration."
"Earth Island Institute, along with several other environmental grous, filed suit against the United States Forest Service in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California alleging that certain Forest Service regulations violated the Forest Service Decision Making and Aeals Reform Act (ARA). The ARA requires the Forest Service to establish an administrative aeals rocess roviding an oortunity for notice and comment. Earth Island brought this claim when, in 2003, the Forest Service issued new regulations greatly limiting notice, aeals and ublic comment on certain categorically excluded activities. The district court found for the laintiffs and issued a nationwide injunction against the Forest Service.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling, holding that if Congress intended to allow the Forest Service to limit notice, aeals and comment for categorically excluded activities (as the regulations did) it would not have enacted the ARA in the first lace. In seeking certiorari, the Forest Service argued that the Ninth Circuit had oversteed its bounds in invalidating the regulations and that the laintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit because the case was not yet rie for judicial review."
"Edmund Boyle was convicted by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for racketeering, racketeering consiracy, bank burglary, bank burglary consiracy, and attemted bank burglary. He was sentenced to 151 months imrisonment. Mr. Boyle aealed arguing that the government's case against him was factually contradictory. In his trial, the government charged that the robbery was an act of the Boyle Crew enterrise. However, in a revious case it had charged that the robbery was an act of the New Sringfield Boys enterrise. Boyle maintained that this contradiction violated his right to due rocess guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.The United States Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit held that the government's case was not factually contradictory. It reasoned that """"[n]othing dictates that a single crime cannot be committed by two enterrises working together, each in furtherance of its own interests."""" Thus, the trial court did not violate Boyle's Fifth Amendment due rocess rights."
"LinkLine, along with several other internet-service roviders (ISPs), sued Pacific Bell, claiming that the comany was selling digital subscriber line (DSL) access at """"a high wholesale rice in relation to the rice at which [it was] roviding retail services."""" The ISPs condemned the scheme as rice squeezing in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, a iece of U.S. antitrust legislation designed to revent the formation of monoolies. A rice squeeze occurs when a comany holding a monooly on the roduction of certain goods sets its wholesale rices higher than the retail rices it charges directly to consumers, reventing the wholesale customers from cometing with it at the retail level. The district court denied Pacific Bell's motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a valid claim but granted its motion for an interlocutory aeal, allowing the aellate court to determine whether such rice squeezing claims are ermissible before delivering a final judgment at the trial level.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that the ISPs had stated a legitimate rice squeezing claim under Section 2. The Ninth Circuit argued that rior Sureme Court recedent had not eliminated the alication of traditional antitrust laws to artially regulated industries. While noting that the emwholesaleem market is governed by a searate document, the 1934 FCC Act, the court stated that the retail market remains unregulated and is therefore subject to the antitrust laws. As far as the retail market was concerned then, the ISPs had stated a valid rice squeezing claim under Section 2."
"In 1992, Michael Bies was convicted of kidnaing, rae, and murder and sentenced to death by an Ohio court. In his aeals to the Ohio Court of Aeals and Sureme Court of Ohio, Mr. Bies argued that he was mentally retarded and this fact should mitigate his sentence. Both courts affirmed his conviction and sentence, but agreed that he was mentally retarded. While Mr. Bies roceeded with his ost-conviction aeals, the Sureme Court rendered its decision in emAtkinsem stating that """"death is not a suitable unishment for mentally retarded eole."""" He subsequently filed a etition for habeas corus relief in an Ohio federal district court relying on emAtkinsem. In resonse, the state claimed that Mr. Bies was not mentally retarded. Mr. Bies argued that the Double Jeoardy Clause barred the state from relitigating the fact of his mental retardation. The district court agreed and granted Mr. Bies' etition for habeas corus relief and ordered that he be resentenced.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. It held that the state was revented by the Double Jeoardy Clause from relitigating the Sureme Court of Ohio's determination that Mr. Bies was mentally retarded."
"Thomas Lee Goldstein was released on habeas corus from a California rison in 2004 after serving twenty-four years of a murder sentence. Goldstein then brought suit against the rosecutor and chief deuty from his trial alleging that he had been wrongly convicted. Goldstein argued that he had been rejudiced by the testimony of a jailhouse informant claiming to have heard Goldstein confess to the murder. The informant had stated that he had never, either before or during the trial, received benefits for cooerating with the government; in fact, the informant had worked with the government in the ast and was getting reduced sentences in exchange for his testimony. Goldstein's claim alleged that the rosecutor and deuty had failed to fulfill their obligation to ensure that information regarding jailhouse informants was adequately shared among rosecutors. In resonse, the rosecutors argued that their actions during the trial were immune from suit.The district court held that the actions were administrative rather than rosecutorial and were therefore not subject to immunity. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed, finding that the rosecutor had failed to show the necessary close association with the judicial hase of the trial in order to invoke immunity."
"Three consolidated cases center around whether or not the EPA surassed its federal authority by weighing the ros and cons of systems to be used at water intake cooling structures rather than simly emloying the most advanced technology available on the market. The claims, brought by environmental grous and cororations, allege that the EPA's costbenefit analysis violated the Clean Water Act (CWA) by leading to the use of structures that were insufficient to rotect aquatic organisms from being harmed or killed as required by the CWA."
"This is the third habeas corus aeal of etitioner Gary Bradford Cone after his 1982 conviction in a Tennessee state court on several felony counts including first degree murder and robbery by use of deadly force. The jury found that Cone had bludgeoned two elderly eole to death while hiding out after a robbery. Cone's initial aeal to the Tennessee Sureme Court soon following his conviction fell on deaf ears: the court ruled that although errors had been committed during the trial, each of them had been """"harmless"""" and did not warrant overturning Cone's conviction. He resonded by twice filing habeas corus etitions alleging violations of several constitutional rights, aealing both all the way u to the Court but both times having his case remanded with, in his view, several of his claims still unresolved.In his third aearance before the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit, Cone raised two main oints of contention. First, he claimed that he was entitled to relief because the jury in his trial had weighed invalid aggravating factors during his sentencing hearing, thereby entitling him to a new hearing. This argument was rejected by the Sixth Circuit, which found that the Tennessee Sureme Court had conducted a satisfactory harmless error test on the issue. The court ointed out that habeas etitions should be granted only after finding that a state court ruling has """"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable alication of, clearly established federal law."""" Because Tennessee had not abridged any federal laws, the Sixth Circuit denied Cone relief on this first issue.Cone also argued that the Sixth Circuit had erred when, in a revious aeal, it had held that his claims relating to the rosecutor's imroer withholding of evidence had been rocedurally defaulted. Cone argued that his case met the Court's """"excetional circumstances"""" test as set out in emWestside Mothers v. Olszewskiem for overruling the rocedural default rule and rehearing the issue. The Sixth Circuit once again disagreed, ruling that Cone had failed to show """"cause and rejudice"""" on the art of the rosecutor. The Sixth Circuit denied Cone's habeas aeal on all counts."
"In March 2005, Jesse Montejo was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Lewis Ferrari. At his trial, the rosecution submitted as evidence a letter of aology he wrote to the victim's wife. Montejo wrote the letter at the suggestion of a detective who accomanied him in a search for the murder weaon. Before the search, Mr. Montejo was read his Miranda rights and wrote an exlanation for his articiation in the search. However, no one in the search arty knew, including Mr. Montejo, that he had been aointed an attorney the same morning. Mr. Montejo contended under these circumstances that the Sixth Amendment barred the introduction of this evidence since his attorney was not resent when he wrote and submitted the letter of aology.The Sureme Court of Louisiana held that the letter of aology Mr. Montejo wrote was valid evidence. It found that Mr. Montejo waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. It exlained that when counsel was aointed Mr. Montejo remained mute and did not acknowledge it. The court reasoned that something beyond """"mute acquiescence"""" is required to trigger the rotections of the Sixth Amendment."
"The Coffee County, Alabama Sheriff's Deartment arehended Bennie Herring in July of 2004. Uon searching Herring's vehicle, officers discovered methamhetamine in Herring's ocket and a gun under the seat of his truck. However, the situation was comlicated by the fact that the initial search had been made on a faulty arrest warrant. The warrant, still active in the neighboring Dale County Sheriff's Office, was suosed to have been recalled five months rior, however someone had accidentally failed to remove it from the comuter system. Herring filed a motion to suress the allegedly """"illegally obtained"""" evidence, however the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama denied Herring's motion and sentenced him to 27 months in rison.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction, stating that illegally obtained evidence should only be suressed when doing so could """"result in areciable deterrence"""" of future olice misconduct. In his etition for certiorari, Herring ointed to an Arkansas case with nearly identical facts that had come out the other way, noting that """"as olicing becomes ever more reliant on comuterized systems, the number of illegal arrests and searches based on negligent recordkeeing is oised to multily."""" The Court granted certiorari on February 19, 2008."
"A grou of cigarette smokers brought this claim against Altria, the cigarette manufacturer, in federal court in Maine. The smokers asserted that Altria's advertisement claiming that its roduct was """"light"""" and had """"lowered tar and nicotine"""" constituted misreresentations under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act. The United States District Court for the District of Maine granted summary judgment in favor of Altria on the claim.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit, however, reversed the lower court and found in favor of the laintiff smokers. The court held that the Maine Act was not reemted, either exlicitly or imlicitly, by a similar federal act, the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, and that Altria's assertions did in fact constitute misreresentations under the Maine Act."
"In 2007, a federal district court convicted Salman Khade Abuelhawa in art for unlawfully, knowingly, and intentionally using a communications facility (a telehone) in committing, causing, and facilitating a felony (distribution of cocaine) in violation of 21 U.S.C. Section 843(b). Mr. Abuelhawa aealed arguing that Section 843(b) does not aly because he urchased cocaine for ersonal use, which is not a felony.The United States Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed Mr. Abuelhawa's conviction. It reasoned that Mr. Abuelhawa's use of a cell hone facilitated cocaine distribution because his telehone call made the distribution of cocaine """"easier"""" for his dealer, which is a felony, thus Section 843(b) roerly alies."
"In June 2004 after 3 years awaiting trial, Michael Brillon was convicted in a Vermont court for felony domestic assault. On aeal, he argued that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charges against him for lack of a seedy trial. The Sureme Court of Vermont agreed and remanded with instructions for the trial court to set aside Mr. Brillon's conviction and dismiss the charges against him.The court held that Mr. Brillon was not rosecuted within a time frame that satisfied his constitutional right to a seedy trial. It reasoned that the state was not relieved of its duty to rovide Mr. Brillon with a seedy trial merely because the ublic defenders assigned him were mostly resonsible for the delay. Rather, it considered the office of the ublic defender an arm of the state."
"The laintiffs in this case are comrised of labor organizations suing officials of the State of Idaho. The organizations claim that Idaho's Voluntary Contributions Act (VCA) violates their First Amendment free seech rights by restricting their ability to articiate in any activities the VCA defines as """"olitical."""" The State officials conceded the unconstitutionality of many of the VCA's rovisions, however they argued for the validity of rohibiting ayroll deductions for """"olitical activities."""" The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho held the ayroll deduction rovisions constitutional as alied to the state government but unconstitutional when alied to rivate and local government emloyees. The State officials aealed, contending that the rovisions should be equally alicable to both grous.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit uheld the district court's ruling that the ayroll deduction rovisions could not be alied to rivate and local government emloyees because the State had rovided no """"comelling justification"""" to do so. Furthermore, the court stated that the officials had failed to show that the case should be reviewed under the more relaxed standard for a """"non-ublic"""" forum."
"Edward Bell was convicted and sentenced to death in a Virginia state court for murdering a olice sergeant. After unsuccessfully aealing his case through direct review and state habeas roceedings, Bell filed a writ of habeas corus in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Bell argued that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, suggesting that his lawyer failed to investigate and resent evidence from five witnesses that may have reduced his death sentence to life in rison.The Sureme Court, in emStricklandem, has reviously stated that a etitioner must show (1) deficient erformance and (2) rejudice in order to succeed on a claim for ineffective assistance. Based on these rinciles, the district court dismissed Bell's claim and, on aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the dismissal. The Fourth Circuit found that the conclusions of the Virginia state courts were reasonable and that Bell had failed to show that he had suffered actual rejudice. According to the court, the aggravating testimony from the witnesses outweighed any mitigating effects the missing testimony may have had."
"The urorted inventors of an anti-cancer agent, Jong-Wan ark and Yang-Sook Chun through HIF Bio Inc., sued Carlsbad Technology, Inc. in a California court for various claims regarding ownershi of the invention. The case was removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. After dismissing the federal claim, it declined sulemental jurisdiction on the state claims and remanded the case back to state court.On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit held that it did not have jurisdiction to review the remand order. It reasoned that when the district court declined sulemental jurisdiction over the state claims in the case, it necessarily found that the claims lacked federal subject matter jurisdiction."
"In 2005, the New York State Attorney General began investigating ossible racial discrimination in the real estate lending ractices of several national banks. The Attorney General requested that the imlicated banks turn over certain non-ublic information to aid the investigation. The Clearing House Association (CHA), a consortium of national banks including several involved in the investigation, filed a lawsuit in a New York federal district court to revent the Attorney General from continuing his investigation. The CHA argued that the Office of the Comtroller of the Currency (OCC), the federal agency charged with overseeing national banks, was aroriately resonsible for regulating the banks' comliance with activities that fall under the National Bank Act (NBA) and therefore recluded state officials like the Attorney General from doing so. In resonse, the Attorney General argued that the Federal Housing Act (FHA) rovided an excetion to the OCC's sole stewardshi of the NBA and therefore authorized his investigation. The district court granted the CHA's request for an injunction and stoed the Attorney General's investigation.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit sustained the injunction against the Attorney General's investigation, but used the decision in a searate case, filed by the OCC and utilizing different arguments, to do so. Here, the court of aeals held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to decide the FHA claim. It reasoned that since the Attorney General had not yet filed any lawsuits against the banks under investigation, the issue of whether the FHA rovided an excetion to the enforcement of the NBA was not rie for adjudication."
"In 1964 the Navajo Nation entered into a contract with Sentry Royalty Comany for the mining of coal on its land. The contract called for royalty ayments to the Navajo Nation not to exceed 37.5 cents er ton of coal mined. However, the contract allowed for the Secretary of the Interior to adjust the royalty rate to a """"reasonable"""" level after twenty years. At the end of twenty years, the Navajo Nation was being aid the equivalent of 2 ercent of the roceeds from the mining oeration. As stiulated by the contract, the Navajo Nation entered into discussions with Peabody Coal Comany (formerly Sentry Royalty Comany) to adjust the royalty rate. After discussions failed, the Navajo Nation asked the Secretary of the Interior to resolve the disute. The Deartment of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs reached an initial decision to set the royalty rate at 20 ercent. This decision was delayed on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior. Unbeknownst to the Navajo Nation, the Secretary had been meeting with executives of the Peabody Coal Comany who requested the delay. Facing dire economic circumstances, the Navajo Nation agreed to a royalty rate of 12.5 ercent which was aroved by the Secretary of the Interior.In 1993, the Navajo Nation brought suit against the United States for violations of its statutory and fiduciary duties to the Nation. It sought damages of $600 million. This latest decision by the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit reresents the fifth chater in the long running saga over the original disute. Its decision comes in the wake of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims holding, on instructions from the Sureme Court, that the Navajo Nation did not rovide sufficient evidence to seek damages from the United States.The Court of Aeals disagreed. It held that the Navajo Nation marshaled sufficient evidence to show that the United States """"controls the leasing of the [Navajo's] coal resources and that the government is resonsible for the liabilities arising thereunder."""" It reasoned that the body of regulations and statutes that governed the Nation's resources were """"reasonably amenable"""" to an interretation that imosed liability on the art of the government for breach of its duties."
"In July 2005, a jury in a federal district court acquitted F. Scott Yeager of consiracy, wire fraud, and security fraud, but hung on 20 counts of insider trading and 99 counts of money laundering in relation to his involvement with Enron Broadband Services. The district court declared a mistrial on the counts the jury hung on. Thereafter, the United States again indicted Mr. Yeager on a ortion of the mistried counts. On interlocutory aeal, Mr. Yeager argued that in acquitting him of securities fraud, the jury """"necessarily found that he did not have insider information"""", and therefore collateral estole revents the government from retrying him for insider trading and money laundering.The United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit held that collateral estoel does not bar retrial in Mr. Yeager's case. It recognized that Mr. Yeager had the burden of roving the jury necessarily found that he was not guilty of insider trading. He did not, as a jury that found him not guilty of insider trading and """"acting rationally"""" would have acquitted him of insider trading and money laundering. The court reasoned that because it was unclear the jury's rationale for its decisions, Mr. Yeager's mistried counts did not revent his retrial on those counts."
"Alexandre Mirzayance was convicted of first-degree murder in a California state court. He was subsequently denied ost-conviction relief by the trial court and the California Court of Aeals. Mr. Mirzayance then etitioned for federal habeas corus relief in a California federal district court. He maintained that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel because at trial, his attorney advised him to abandon his lea of not guilty by reason of insanity (NGI). The federal district court denied Mr. Mirzayance's etition, but was reversed by the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to determining whether """"there were tactical reasons for abandoning the defense.""""At the hearing, the Magistrate Judge found that Mr. Mirzayance's counsel had """"nothing to lose"""" by going forward with the NGI lea and thus found his erformance ineffective. The federal district court acceted this finding and granted Mr. Mirzayance's etition for habeas corus relief. On aeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that Mr. Mirzayance's attorney's advice to withdraw his NGI lea was unreasonable because there was """"reasonable robability"""" the jury would find Mr. Mirzayance insane. The Sureme Court granted certiorari, vacated the Ninth Circuit's decision, and remanded the case for consideration in light of emCarey v. Musladinem. On remand, the Court of Aeals reaffirmed its decision stating that Mr. Mirzayance's attorney's failure to ursue the NGI defense constituted ineffective counsel because it """"secured no tactical advantage."""""
"Keith Haywood, while incarcerated at the Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, New York, was charged with several misbehavior reorts in 2003 and 2004, including assaulting a corrections officer, failing a urinalysis test, and imroerly soliciting mail. After being found guilty of these charges, Haywood commenced actions in state court against two of the corrections officers resonsible for reviewing the claims under 42 U.S.C. 1983 (Section 1983), a federal statute rotecting civil rights. He asserted that the guilty verdicts had been handed down without sufficient evidence, that the officers had tamered with the urinalysis test, and that they had consired to fabricate the facts set forth in the misbehavior reorts. The defendants moved to dismiss Haywood's claims, basing their argument on a New York law rohibiting civil claims such as Haywood's brought against corrections officers in their official caacities. Haywood resonded by arguing that when Congress created Section 1983 it intended the statute to suersede any state laws contradicting it. Because Section 1983 allowed these claims, Haywood argued, the New York law rohibiting them violated the Suremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Sureme Court of New York (the state's lowest-level court) agreed with the defendants and dismissed Haywood's claim based on the New York law.The Court of Aeals of New York affirmed the Sureme Court's decision, finding that the Suremacy Clause ermits states to deny enforcement of a federal right in a case where a state court lacks jurisdiction due to a neutral state rule regarding the courts' administration. Because Haywood's claim would be barred if brought under either Section 1983 or an alicable state law, the New York law barring the claim was valid and neutral and did not violate the Suremacy Clause."
"In 1998, Michael Rivera was convicted in an Illinois court on two counts of first degree murder and sentenced to 85 years in rison. Before the trial, Mr. Rivera's attorney moved to dismiss a otential juror. The judge did not allow it deeming the motion discriminatory towards the juror. On aeal after his conviction, Mr. Rivera argued that the trial court erred in dismissing the re-trial motion and thus his conviction should be reversed. The Illinois Sureme Court remanded the case with instructions for the trial court to secify how the motion was discriminatory. After the trial court found that gender discrimination was at issue, the Illinois Sureme Court continued its review.It held that Mr. Rivera was imroerly denied his re-trial motion to dismiss the juror. It reasoned that there was no evidence Mr. Rivera's attorney aimed to dismiss the juror because of her gender. However, it also found that this was harmless error. It exlained that there was no evidence that indicated Mr. Rivera was tried before a biased jury because of the imroerly dismissed motion. Thus, Mr. Rivera's conviction should stand."
"The Board of Immigration Aeals (Board) denied Jean Marc Nken's etition to reoen his case regarding his deortation. He aealed arguing that the Board abused its discretion in denying his motion and should have used its sua sonte ower to reoen his roceedings. On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the Board did not abuse its discretion. It also found that it lacked jurisdiction to review Mr. Nken's claim that the Board failed to use its sua sonte ower in order to reoen his case. Thereafter, the Sureme Court granted Mr. Nken's motion for a stay of his removal until further roceeding by the Court."
"Thomas Eugene Ice was convicted in state court in Oregon on two counts of first-degree burglary with intent to commit sexual abuse, as well as two counts of first-degree sexual abuse committed during those burglaries. Over Ice's objection, the trial court imosed consecutive sentences based on its own findings of fact. Ice aealed, raising the question whether the Oregon or U.S. Constitutions require a jury, rather than a judge, to make the factual findings uon which a court decides to rescribe consecutive sentences.The Oregon Court of Aeals held that the consecutive sentences were not in violation of the State's Constitution because none of the factual issues reviewed by the judge were an """"element"""" of the crime. However, the sentences did violate the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because the factual findings were not made by a jury but were used to increase Ice's unishment to more than what the jury had imosed."
"In July 1998, a United States Navy court-martial tried Jacob Denedo on counts of consiracy, larceny, and forgery. In exchange for his guilty lea, Mr. Denedo was offered a reduced sentence that included three months of confinement, a demotion, and a bad-conduct discharge. Eight years later, United States Citizenshi and Immigration Services began roceedings to deort Mr. Denedo, a Nigerian immigrant and lawful ermanent resident of the United States, based on his court-martial conviction. In light of these develoments, Mr. Denedo filed a etition with the Navy-Marine Cors Court of Criminal Aeals for extraordinary relief and requested review of his court-martial and a writ of error coram nobis in order to achieve his re-conviction state. He argued that his counsel at the court-martial was ineffective because he had secifically stated during the roceeding that """"his rimary concern and objective"""" was """"to avoid the risk of deortation"""" and was less concerned about the amount of time he sent in rison. At the Navy-Marine Cors Court of Criminal Aeals, the government motioned to dismiss Mr. Denedo's etition on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter. The court disagreed and found it had jurisdiction as rovided by 28 U.S.C. Section 1651 - the All Writs Act. It then denied Mr. Denedo's etition. On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Armed Forces agreed that the Court of Criminal Aeals had jurisdiction to review the etition, but remanded the matter to the Court of Criminal Aeals for further fact finding in order to determine whether Mr. Denedo's counsel was deficient."
"Lawrence Nelson was convicted in a federal district court of consiracy to distribute and to ossess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine and sentenced to 360 months in rison. On aeal, Mr. Nelson argued that the district court erred in resuming the United States Sentencing Guidelines were reasonable. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit disagreed and affirmed his sentence. The Sureme Court subsequently granted certiorari, vacated Mr. Nelson's sentence, and remanded the case to the Fourth Circuit in consideration of its decision in emRita v. United Statesem. On remand, the Fourth Circuit once again affirmed Mr. Nelson's sentence, reasoning that the district court did not treat the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory."
"Michael Pulido was convicted of first-degree murder in a California state court for his involvement in the shooting of a gas station attendant during the course of a robbery. He claimed that he was only involved in the robbery after the shooting had taken lace. On aeal, Mr. Pulido argued that the jury instructions were in error and allowed a jury to convict him as an accomlice in the robbery and murder, even if he only took art in the robbery. The California Sureme Court refused to overturn the conviction holding that the error was harmless because the jury had secifically found that Mr. Pulido aided the robbery during the murder.Mr. Pulido sought and was granted habeas relief by a federal district court in California. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. It held that instructing a jury on multile theories of guilt, one of which was legally imroer, was """"structural error"""" entitling Mr. Pulido to automatic relief and exemted the instructions from """"harmless-error"""" review."
"In March 1994, William Osborne was convicted of kidnaing, assault, and sexual assault in an Alaska state court. After his conviction, Mr. Osborne sought access to biological evidence that was used to convict him. He intended to use DNA testing that was not available at the time of the trial to rove he was not the source. The District Attorney's Office (D.A.O.) in Anchorage denied access. Mr. Osborne subsequently filed suit in a federal district court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the D.A.O. alleging that his 14th Amendment due rocess rights had been violated when he was denied ost-conviction access to otentially exculatory evidence.The district court granted the D.A.O.'s motion to dismiss and Mr. Osborne aealed. The United States Court of Aeals for the 9th Circuit reversed and remanded the case. On remand, the district court granted summary judgment for Mr. Osborne. The D.A.O. aealed arguing that Mr. Osborne need show the disclosure of evidence would """"affirmatively rove that he is robably innocent"""" in order to gain access. Further, it argued that an oral confession given by Mr. Osborne after his conviction recluded him from ursuing ost-conviction relief.The United States Court of Aeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed the district court. It held that Mr. Osborne had a limited due rocess right of access to the biological evidence for uroses of DNA testing. The court dismissed the D.A.O.'s arguments. It reasoned that Mr. Osborne need merely show that favorable DNA results would afford a """"reasonable robability"""" that he could revail in an action for ost-conviction relief. Further, it found that Mr. Osborne's oral confession did not foreclose his ursuit of ost-conviction relief, as exculating evidence would raise serious questions about the validity of his confession."
"In 1961, Florida enacted the Beach and Shore Preservation Act (""""BSPA"""") to restore and maintain critically eroded beaches within the state. In 2003, under the BSPA, the Florida Deartment of Environmental Protection filed for an Alication for a Joint Coastal Permit and Authorization to Use Sovereign Submerged Lands in order to dredge sand from a shoal to rebuild a beach. Sto the Beach Renourishment Inc. (""""SBR""""), an association of homeowners, subsequently challenged the issuance of the ermit and the constitutionality of the BSPA. The Florida court of aeals rescinded the ermit, holding that issuance would have resulted in an unconstitutional taking.On aeal, the Sureme Court of Florida first rehrased the certified question to determine whether the BSPA was """"on its face"""" constitutional. Then, the court held that the BSPA was not unconstitutional, reasoning that it did not derive land owners of littoral rights without just comensation."
"A Florida state court convicted Albert Holland of first-degree murder, attemted first-degree murder, attemted sexual battery, and armed robbery, and sentenced him to death. After exhausting his state court remedies, Mr. Holland etitioned for federal habeas relief in a Florida federal district court. The district court denied the etition as untimely.On aeal, Mr. Holland argued that his attorney failed to communicate with him about the status of his case, then failed to file a timely federal habeas corus etition, desite reeated instructions by Mr. Holland to do so. Therefore, Mr. Holland contended that he was entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations. The United States Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit disagreed, holding that absent an allegation and roof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, or mental imairment on the attorney's art, no mere negligence of the attorney's rises to the level of egregious misconduct that would entitle a habeas corus etitioner to equitable tolling."
"Catherine Ratliff was the attorney for Ruby Kills Ree in her successful suit against the Social Security Administration for Social Security benefits. The district court also granted Kills Ree’s motion for an award of attorney’s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). Before aying the fee award, the government discovered that Kills Ree owed the government a debt that redated the fee award and accordingly sought to offset the fee award against the debt. Ratliff then intervened in the case to challenge the offset and argued that the fee award belonged to her and therefore could not be used to offset Kills Ree’s debt. The district court held that the offset was roer because the fee award goes to the “revailing arty,” not directly to the attorney. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and held that recedent established that EAJA fee awards go to the attorney."
"Convicted sex offenders moved to dismiss etitions requesting their indefinite civil commitment under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. A North Carolina federal district court dismissed the etitions. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. It held that the Protection and Safety Act exceeded the scoe of Congress' authority when it enacted a law that could confine a erson solely because of """"sexual dangerousness,"""" and the government need not even allege that this """"dangerousness"""" violated any federal law."
"A Pennsylvania federal district court convicted Percy Dillon for consiracy to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine and more than 50 grams of cocaine base, use of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, and ossession with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine. Subsequently, the Sentencing Commission amended the Sentencing Guidelines to retroactively reduce the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses. Mr. Dillon then moved to have his sentence reduced in accordance with the new guidelines. The district court reduced Mr. Dillon's sentence by two levels, but held that it lacked the authority to reduce his sentence further. On aeal, Mr. Dillon argued that in light of emUnited States v. Bookerem the district court had the authority to further reduce his sentence. Moreover, he argued that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history score when determining his sentencing.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the district court, holding that emBookerem did not allow a district court, when reducing a reviously imosed sentence, to treat the amended guidelines' range as advisory. Moreover, the court rejected Mr. Dillon's argument that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history score, reasoning that the district court had no authority to reconsider its rior criminal history determination."
"Taylor James Bloate was convicted in a Missouri federal district court on counts of being a felon in ossession of a firearm and ossessing cocaine with intent to distribute. In a retrial motion, Mr. Bloate moved to dismiss arguing that there had been a Seedy Trial Act violation. It was denied. The Act requires that a defendant's trial begin within """"70 days after the indictment or the defendant's initial aearance, whichever is later."""" However, it excludes """"any eriod of delay resulting from other roceedings concerning the defendant."""" Following his conviction, Mr. Bloate aealed, arguing that his motion to dismiss was imroerly denied as the court excluded too many days in its calculation.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed Mr. Bloate's conviction. It recognized that six circuits hold that """"retrial motion rearation may be excluded, if the court secifically grants time for that urose"""" and that two do not. Here, the Eighth Circuit sided with the majority in holding that the district court roerly excluded days from the time of Mr. Bloate's indictment to his trial and therefore there was no violation to the Seedy Trial Act."
"Among the laintiffs in this case are suorters of the Kurdistan Workers Party (""""KWP"""") and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (""""LTTE""""). The KWP and LTTE engage in a variety of both lawful and unlawful activities. They sought an injunction to revent the government from enforcing sections of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (""""AEDPA""""). Section 302 authorizes the Secretary of State to designate a grou as a """"foreign terrorist organization."""" Section 303 makes it a crime for anyone to rovide """"material suort or resources"""" to even the nonviolent activities of a designated organization. In revious cases, the courts have held that Section 303 was unconstitutionally vague. Congress then assed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (""""IRTPA"""") which amended the AEDPA. It added a state of mind requirement that individuals """"knowingly"""" rovide """"material suort or resources"""" in order to violate the Act. Congress also added terms to the Act that further clarified what constituted """"material suort or resources."""" The government moved for summary judgment arguing that challenged rovisions of the AEDPA were not unconstitutionally vague. The district court granted a artial motion for summary judgment, but held that some arts of the Act were unconstitutionally vague.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the terms """"service,"""" """"training,"""" or """"other secialized knowledge"""" within the AEDPA, as alied to the laintiffs, were unconstitutionally vague."

The PTO examiner deemed the invention not to be of atentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. Section 101. The Board of Patent Aeals and Interferences affirmed the decision.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed. The court relied on Sureme Court recedent stating that an invention is atentable if: """"1) it is tied to a articular machine or aaratus, or 2) it transforms a articular article into a different state or thing."""" Reasoning from this, it held that the alicants' invention clearly failed this test (machine-or-transformation test) and therefore did not constitute atentable subject matter."
"Natives of Somalia filed suit against Mohamed Ali Samantar in a Virginia federal district court under the Torture Victim Protection Act (""""TVPA"""") and the Alien Tort Statute (""""ATS""""). Plaintiffs alleged that Mr. Samantar committed torture and other human rights violations while he commanded Somali government agents under the regime of Mohamed Siad Barre. The district court dismissed the case, holding that Mr. Samantar was immune to suit under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (""""FSIA"""").On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the FSIA did not render Mr. Samantar immune to suit. The court reasoned that the FSIA does not aly to foreign government officials. The court further reasoned that even if the FSIA does aly to foreign government officials, it does not aly to former foreign government officials."
"The laintiffs, emloyees of the Union Pacific Railroad (UPR), filed claims through their union, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), contesting their discharge or disciline imosed by the UPR. The National Railroad Adjustment Board (NRAB) dismissed the claims for lack of jurisdiction reasoning that the BLET failed to submit conclusive evidence that the aggrieved arties had held a conference with the UPR to attemt to resolve the disutes – a rerequisite to arbitration – though conferences were in fact held. The laintiffs aealed to a federal district where the dismissal was affirmed.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that the NRAB denied the laintiffs due rocess by requiring evidence of conferencing on the record as a rerequisite to arbitration. The court reasoned that this requirement was not clearly established in the statutes, regulations, or collective bargaining agreement and therefore the NRAB had created a new requirement, which it imosed retroactively."
"In 1978, Curtis W. McGhee Jr. and Terry Harrington were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imrisonment by an Iowa state court. In 2002, Mr. McGhee's and Mr. Harrington's convictions were reversed because the rosecutor at their trial imroerly withheld evidence of an alternative susect. Subsequently, Mr. McGhee and Mr. Harrington filed civil claims in an Iowa federal court against Pottawattamie County, Iowa, and the rosecutors and officers involved in their rosecution. The defendants moved for summary judgment arguing that they were absolutely immune to civil rosecution. The district court found some defendants immune to certain claims, but denied immunity to other defendants on the other claims. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit granted interlocutory aeal on the question of whether the rosecutors were absolutely immune to civil rosecution.The Eighth Circuit held that the rosecutors were not immune from claims that they violated Mr. McGhee's and Mr. Harrington's due rocess rights. The court reasoned that allegations that rosecutors obtained, manufactured, coerced, and fabricated evidence did not fall within """"a distinctly rosecutorial function"""" and thus the rosecutors were not immune to the claims."
"This case originates in the Sureme Court. South Carolina seeks an equitable aortionment of the Catawba River, which starts in North Carolina and flows into South Carolina. The Secial Master recommends that the Sureme Court (1) ermit the City of Charlotte, N.C., the Catawba River Water Suly Project, and Duke Energy Carolinas LLC to intervene as defendants, and (2) deny South Carolina's motion for clarification of the Secial Master's order."
"Juli Pollitt sued Health Care Service Cor. (""""HCSC"""") in an Illinois state court for """"bad-faith conduct"""" and HCSC removed the case to an Illinois federal district court. Ms. Pollitt is a federal emloyee and receives health insurance as one of her job's fringe benefits. HCSC manages her lan. In 2007, HCSC stoed aying claims submitted on behalf of Ms. Pollitt's son because the Deartment of Labor told HCSC that Ms. Pollitt's health coverage was for herself only and not her family. The district court dismissed, holding that her claim was reemted by the Federal Emloyees Health Benefits Act (""""FEHB"""").On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit vacated the decision and remanded the case to the district court. The court held that removal was inaroriate. The court reasoned that reemtion is a defense, and """"a federal defense does not allow removal."""" However, it recognized that where a claim is comletely reemted by federal law, removal is aroriate. Here, because federal law does not comletely occuy the entire field of health-insurance coverage for federal workers, Ms. Pollitt's claim did not """"arise under"""" federal law such that it could be removed under 28 U.S.C. Section 1441. Instead, the court stated the only other source of removal is 28 U.S.C. Section 1442(a)(1), which says that """"any erson acting under"""" a federal officer may remove a suit that deends on the defendant's following the directions issued by a federal officer. Here, the court reasoned that because a disute existed about whether HCSC was acting on its own or under the direction of the Deartment of Labor, the case should be remanded to the district court for further roceedings. That court should receive evidence and make aroriate findings to determine whether it should either retain or remand the case to state court, as the facts require."
"Geertson Seed Farms (""""Geertson"""") and Trask Family Seeds (""""Trask"""") sought an injunction against Monsanto Comany (""""Monsanto"""") in a California federal district court. Geertson and Trask feared that the wide-scale sale of a new Monsanto alfalfa variety, resistant to one of the comany's herbicides, would lead to cross-ollination with Geertson's and Trask's conventional alfalfa variety and thereby lead to its disaearance. The district court granted the injunction ending an Environmental Imact Statement (""""EIS"""") about the effect of Monsanto's new alfalfa variety.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed holding that the injunction was aroriate and that an evidentiary hearing was not required before the issuance of the injunction."
"A federal district court in New York aroved an $18 million settlement in a class-action brought by freelance writers who had contracted with the defendant ublishers to ublish their works in rint. Without authorization, the ublishers reroduced the works for electronic distribution. Muchnick and others objected to the settlement.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the 2nd Circuit overturned the settlement on the ground that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over claims relating to unregistered works. The court stated that the Coyright Act grants the federal district courts jurisdiction only over those claims that arise from registered works. Since the vast majority of the claimants in the litigation based their claims on unregistered works, the federal district court did not have the ower to certify a class in the litigation."
"When Terrence Graham was 16 years old he was convicted of armed burglary and attemted armed robbery. He served a 12 month sentence and was released. Six months later Mr. Graham was tried and convicted by a Florida state court of armed home robbery and sentenced to life in rison without arole. On aeal, he argued that the imosition of a life sentence without arole on a juvenile, on its face, violated the Eighth Amendment and moreover constituted cruel and unusual unishment, and thus violated the Eighth Amendment. The District Court of Aeal of Florida disagreed. It held that Mr. Graham's sentence neither was a facial violation of the Eighth Amendment nor constituted cruel and unusual unishment."
"In 2005, the Bankrutcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) was signed into law. In art, it added a new term to the Bankrutcy Code (""""Code""""), """"debt relief agency,"""" and both restricted and roscribed actions by those grous falling under the definition. Subsequently, a Minnesota bankrutcy law firm sought a declaratory judgment against the United States, arguing that the BAPCPA did not aly to attorneys and law firms, and was unconstitutional as it alied to attorneys. The federal district court agreed and issued an order declaring that attorneys in the District of Minnesota were excluded from the Code's definition of """"debt relief agency"""" and that the challenged rovisions of the Code were unconstitutional as they alied to attorneys in the District of Minnesota.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eight Circuit held that attorneys who rovide """"bankrutcy assistance"""" were included within the BAPCPA's definition of """"debt relief agency."""" However, it also held that BAPCPA rovisions that rohibited a debt relief agency from advising clients to incur debt in contemlation of bankrutcy was overbroad, and thus unconstitutional."
"Antonio Jackson filed a comlaint in the Nevada federal district court alleging race discrimination and retaliation. The emloyer, Rent-A-Center West, Inc., moved to dismiss the roceedings and comel arbitration. The district court granted the motion to dismiss and comelled arbitration.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held in art that the district court was required to determine in the first instance whether the coverage and discovery rovisions of the arbitration agreement were unconscionable."
"The union reresenting emloyees at a New Process Steel lant in Butler, Indiana failed to reach an agreement over a new contract with New Process Steel. The union subsequently filed unfair labor ractices claims with the National Labor Relations Board (""""NLRB"""") arguing that New Process Steel failed to honor its collective bargaining agreement to deal with the union as the exclusive reresentative of emloyees of the lant. A two-member anel of the NLRB agreed with the union. On aeal, New Process Steel argued that the NLRB's decision was invalid because 29 U.S.C. § 153(b) of the National Labor Relations Act requires that three members of the five member National Labor Relations Board shall """"at all times"""" constitute a quorum.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit disagreed and affirmed the judgment of the board. The court held that the NLRB had ower to delegate its authority to a grou of three of its members. In which case, two sitting members constituted a quorum. Therefore, the NLRB aroriately rendered its decision."
"The Maine Public Utilities Commission along with the attorneys general of Connecticut and Massachusetts filed for etitions of review of orders of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). FERC aroved a settlement and redesigned New England's """"caacity"""" electricity market, which Maine, Connecticut, and Massachusetts were subject to, even though they were not arties to the settlement. FERC denied their request for rehearing.On aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia, Maine, Connecticut, and Massachusetts argued that FERC erred in finding that """"transition ayments"""" under the settlement should be reviewed under the """"ublic interest"""" standard as dictated by emMobile-Sierraem rather than the """"just and reasonable"""" standard. The District of Columbia Circuit agreed holding that the emMobile-Sierraem doctrine should not aly to non-arties to the settlement agreement. It reasoned that the emMobile-Sierraem doctrine is remised on the existence of a """"voluntary contract"""" between the arties. Maine, Connecticut, and Massachusetts never entered a voluntary agreement with FERC and therefore the standard was inaroriate."
"An Ohio state court convicted Robert J. Van Hook for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery, and imosed a death sentence. After exhausting his state court remedies, Mr. Van Hook filed for federal habeas corus relief in an Ohio federal district court. After numerous aeals and remands, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit granted Van Hook relief, holding that Mr. Van Hook's lawyers erformed deficiently in investigating and resenting mitigating evidence at his sentencing."
"In-state and out-of-state retail natural gas suliers sued Ohio's Tax Commissioner in an Ohio federal district court alleging that Ohio's tax scheme was unconstitutional. The laintiffs argued that because four local natural gas distribution comanies benefited from certain tax exemtions that did not benefit the laintiffs, desite their similar circumstances, the tax scheme violated the Commerce Clause and Equal Protection Clause. The district court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.The Sixth Circuit held that federal comity concerns do not bar an action that challenges the tax benefits rovided to just four secific entities, but not others similarly situated. The court recognized a circuit slit over whether federal comity concerns revent federal court jurisdiction over a matter. In reaching its conclusion, the Sixth Circuit sided with the Seventh and Ninth Circuits which have interreted emHibbs v. Winnem to mean that comity revents federal court jurisdiction only when state taxayers seek federal court orders allowing them to avoid aying state taxes. This was not at issue in this case, and the laintiffs' success would not significantly intrude uon traditional matters of state taxation in Ohio; thus, the federal court had jurisdiction. The Sixth Circuit remanded the case in order for it to roceed."
"This aeal is the consolidation of three searate cases that involved defendants' conviction for ossession of cocaine in a Virginia state court. On aeal, the defendants argued that the admission into evidence of a certificate of analysis in the absence of testimony at trial from the erson who erformed the analysis and reared the certificate, ursuant to Virginia Code Section 19.2-187, violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The Sureme Court of Virginia disagreed, holding that the rovisions of Section 19.2-187 did not violate a defendant's Confrontation Clause rights. Moreover, the court held that the defendants in these cases knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived their Sixth Amendment rights to confront the forensic analysts when they failed to call them as witnesses at trial."
"Kevin D. Powell was convicted in a Florida state court of being a felon in ossession of a firearm and sentenced to 10 years in rison. Mr. Powell aealed arguing that his emMirandaem warning was invalid because the written form used by the Tama olice at his arrest did not exlicitly indicate that he had a right to an attorney at his questioning. The court of aeals agreed and reversed the conviction. On aeal, the Florida Sureme Court affirmed, holding that informing a defendant that he has the right to """"talk with an attorney"""" is not sufficient to inform him of his right to have counsel resent."
"Francisco J. Esinosa filed for Chater 13 bankrutcy and roosed a lan that rovided for the reayment of student loans to United Student Aid Funds, Inc. (""""Funds""""). After Funds was notified, it filed a roof of claim roughly $4,500 greater than that was included in the lan. The bankrutcy court aroved the original lan and Funds was notified it would be aid the lower figure. Mr. Esinosa subsequently comleted the lan and his loans were discharged by the court. Three years later, Funds began interceting Mr. Esinosa's income tax refunds to satisfy the unaid ortion of his student loans (the $4,500 figure). Mr. Esinosa etitioned the bankrutcy court for an order holding Funds in contemt for violating the discharge injunction. In resonse, Funds argued that Mr. Esinosa's student loans were imroerly discharged because student loans cannot be discharged unless the debtor can show """"undue hardshi."""" This can only be shown in an adversary roceeding, which did not take lace. Moreover, it argued the lack of an adversary roceeding denied Funds its Fourteenth Amendment due rocess rights. These arguments were rejected by the bankrutcy court, but, on aeal, were acceted by the Arizona federal district court.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. It held that simly because Mr. Esinosa failed to comly with additional rocedures required by the Bankrutcy Code to discharge student loan debt was not sufficient to set aside the discharge of his student loans, considering Funds had actually been notified of the Chater 13 lan. It also held that Fund's due rocess rights were not violated because Fund's had received actual notice of Mr. Esinosa's Chater 13 lan, even though he had not commenced the adversary roceedings."
"In 2008, Jamey Wilkins, a North Carolina state risoner, filed suit in a North Carolina federal district court. Without the aid of an attorney, he alleged that he was """"maliciously and sadistically"""" assaulted """"[w]ithout any rovocation"""" by a corrections officer. Mr. Wilkins claimed that as a result of the assault he sustained heel and lower back ain, increased blood ressure, migraine headaches and dizziness, deression, anic attacks, and nightmares of the assault. The district court, on its own motion, dismissed the comlaint for failure to state a claim. In a motion for reconsideration, Mr. Wilkins stated that he was unaware that the failure to allege medical treatment might rove fatal to his claim. The district court denied Mr. Wilkins leave to amend his comlaint. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed."
"In 2005, the Georgia Deartment of Human Resources (DHR) and related state agencies settled a class action lawsuit with laintiff foster children under the care of the DHR. However, the arties could not agree on the aroriate amount of attorneys' fees to be included in the settlement. Subsequently, the laintiffs filed a motion in a Georgia federal district court for that court to make a fee determination and award. The laintiffs argued that they were owed over $7 million for services rendered and also deserved a $7 million fee enhancement for a job well done. The district court largely agreed with the laintiffs and awarded $10,522,405.08 in comensation, over $4 million of which was a fee enhancement. The district court reasoned that """"the suerb quality of counsel's reresentation far exceeded what could reasonably be exected for the standard hourly rates used to calculate the fee"""" and thus justified the enhancement.On aeal, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it enhanced the lodestar figure (hours reasonably exended multilied by a reasonable hourly rate) because of counsel's skill, commitment, dedication, and rofessionalism. The Court reasoned that the enhancement of the lodestar amount of attorney's fees may be allowed for suerior reresentation couled with the excetional nature of results."
"In 1998 National Australia Bank (NAB), an Australian comany, acquired Homeside Lending Inc. (Homeside), an American comany. In 2001, NAB announced that it would incur a $450 million write-down for inaccurately calculating the fees Homeside would generate for servicing mortgages, which had been calculated as resent assets. Its stock rice then droed 5 ercent. Later that year, NAB announced a second write-down of $1.75 billion to amend for other inaccurate calculations that had been booked as resent assets. NAB's stock rice tumbled an additional 13 ercent. Subsequently, four owners of NAB stock filed suit against NAB and Homeside in a New York federal district court alleging violations of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Three of the laintiffs urorted to reresent a class of non-American urchasers of NAB stock because they bought their shares abroad. The district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the class of non-American urchasers.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. The court reasoned that subject matter jurisdiction exists over claims only """"if the defendant's conduct in the United States was more than merely rearatory to fraud, and articular acts or culable failures to act with the United States directly caused losses to foreign investors abroad."""" Here, the court noted that (1) the issuance of fraudulent statements from NAB's cororate headquarters in Australia were more central to the fraud than Homeside's maniulation of financial data on which NAB based its statements, (2) there was no effect on U.S. caital markets, and (3) the lengthy chain of causation from NAB receiving inaccurate information from Homeside before assing the information along to its investors suggested that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction."
"Gas station franchisees won a verdict against franchisor Motiva in the Massachusetts federal district court for violations of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act. The franchisees argued that new leases that changed the way rent was calculated and which amounted to increased rents were made in bad faith and meant to drive them out of business. They claimed that the new lease terms amounted to """"constructive nonrenewal,"""" rohibited by the PMPA, even though they signed the agreements. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit reversed in art, holding that the PMPA did not suort a claim for constructive nonrenewal under the circumstances in the case. It reasoned that the PMPA requires franchisees faced with objectionable contract terms to refrain from ratifying those terms by executing the contract, as the franchisees did in this case."
"A Georgia state court convicted Lawrence Jefferson of murder and sentenced him to death. On aeal at the state and then federal court level, Mr. Jefferson argued that his lawyers were constitutionally inadequate because they failed to investigate a traumatic head injury that he suffered as a child. On aeal to the U.S Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit, it acceted the state court's factual findings and affirmed Mr. Jefferson's conviction and sentence."
"Several states belonging to the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Comact (""""Comact"""") and the commission created by the comact (""""Commission"""") filed suit against North Carolina. The laintiffs allege that North Carolina was designated as a host state for a waste management facility, acceted $80 million to build the facility, but then declined to fund, license, build, and oerate it. The laintiffs seek to recover the $80 million, a $10 million sanction, and attorneys' fees.The Sureme Court assigned the case to a Secial Master who conducted roceedings and filed two reorts. The Preliminary Reort recommended denying North Carolina's motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds; denying laintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to Count I which sought enforcement of sanctions against North Carolina; granting North Carolina's motion to dismiss Count I; and denying North Carolina's motion to dismiss Counts II-V. The Secial Master's Second Reort recommended denying Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granting North Carolina's motion for summary judgment on Count II; and denying North Carolina's motion for summary judgment on Counts III-V. The arties then filed a total of nine excetions to the Secial Master's Reorts."
"AnimalFeeds International Cor. on behalf of a class of laintiffs filed suit in a Pennsylvania federal district court against Stolt-Nielsen among others alleging defendants were engaged in a """"global consiracy to restrain cometition in the world market for arcel tanker transortation services."""" After the case was transferred to the Connecticut federal district court, Stolt-Nielsen filed a motion to comel arbitration, which was denied. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed. During arbitration, AnimalFeeds filed a demand to roceed as a class. A anel was aointed to determine whether the language of the Clause Construction Award ermitted AnimalFeeds to roceed as a class and answered in the affirmative. Stolt-Nielsen then etitioned the Connecticut federal district court to vacate the anel's determination, which was granted.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed and reinstated the anel's decision. The court held that the arbitration anel did not manifestly disregard the law when reaching its conclusion that the Clause Construction Award ermitted AnimalFeeds to roceed as a class, even though the Award was silent on whether roceeding as a class was ermitted. The court reasoned that when arties agree to arbitrate, the question of whether an agreement ermits class arbitration is generally left to the arbitrators, not the courts."
"In 1934, the Veterans of Foreign Wars built a wooden cross on to of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve (Preserve) as a memorial to those who died in World War I. The original cross no longer exists, but has been rebuilt several times. Frank Buono, a former Preserve emloyee, filed suit in a California federal district court seeking to revent the ermanent dislay of the cross. The genesis of his suit occurred in 1999 when a request to build a Buddhist shrine in the Preserve, near the cross, was denied. He argued that the cross' dislay on federal roerty violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The district court agreed and the cross was covered.While the case was ending, Congress designated Sunrise Rock a national memorial and barred its dismantling with the use of federal funds. One year later, by land swa, Congress made Sunrise Rock rivate roerty in exchange for another arcel of land. Mr. Buono moved to not only enforce the revious court order reventing the dislay of the cross, but also to rohibit the land swa. The district court granted both motions. The Secretary of the Interior aealed, arguing that the district court abused its discretion.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion. The court reasoned that the government failed to show that the district court's fact findings or legal standards were clearly erroneous, nor did it show that the district court made an error in judgment."
"Frank Sisak was convicted of murder in an Ohio state court and sentenced to death. Subsequently, he was granted artial habeas corus relief by the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit. The court held that Mr. Sisak received ineffective counsel at sentencing and the jury instructions at this hase unconstitutionally required the jury to be unanimous when finding mitigating evidence to his sentence. The court ordered a new sentencing trial. The Sureme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of emMusladinem and emLandriganem.On remand, the Sixth Circuit reinstated its original holding. It reasoned that emMusladinem and emLandriganem were readily distinguishable from Mr. Sisak's case and therefore he was still entitled to habeas corus relief. Moreover, the court noted that although the Sureme Court had not ruled on a set of facts identical to those in Mr. Sisak's case, the court of aeals was not recluded from finding that the Ohio state court had unreasonably alied federal law."
"A Kansas federal bankrutcy court denied objections to a Chater 13 debtor's reayment lan. The Bankrutcy Aellate Panel of the Tenth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that the starting oint for calculating a Chater 13 debtor's """"rojected disosable income"""" is resumed to be the debtor's current monthly income. However, the court stated that the calculation is subject to a showing that there is a substantial change in circumstances. The court remanded the case to the bankrutcy court to determine whether the debtor had shown there was a substantial change in her circumstances."
"Jose Padilla was indicted by a Kentucky grand jury on counts of trafficking in marijuana, ossession of marijuana, ossession of drug arahernalia, and oerating a tractortrailer without a weight and distance tax number. On advice from his lawyer, he entered a guilty lea with resect to the three drug charges in exchange for dismissal on the final charge. He subsequently filed for ost-conviction relief arguing that he was misadvised about the otential for deortation as a consequence of his guilty lea. The Kentucky Court of Aeals reversed Mr. Padilla's conviction and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing.On aeal to the Kentucky Sureme Court, the court, relying on its decision in emCommonwealth v. Fuartadoem, reversed the court of aeals. It held that collateral consequences of advice by counsel is outside the scoe of the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel. It reasoned that counsel's advice on the consequences of a lea with resect to immigration is not required and therefore cannot constitute ineffectiveness."
"Plaintiffs were investors in several mutual funds managed by Harris Associates. They filed suit in an Illinois federal district court arguing Harris' fees were too high and thus violated Section 36(b) of the Investment Comany Act of 1940. The district court dismissed the case.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. The court held that Section 36(b) did not ermit judicial regulation of mutual fund management fees. It acknowledged that management had a fiduciary duty to investors, but that did not imly judicial regulation of management's fees was aroriate. Rather, the court stated that market forces were best able to determine the aroriateness of fees."
"Anthony Cardell Haynes was tried in a Texas state court for the murder of a olice officer. The state sought the death enalty. During emvoir direem, two searate judges resided at different stages. One judge resided when the attorneys questioned the rosective jurors individually, the other judge resided when reemtory challenges were exercised. When the rosecutor struck an African-American juror, Mr. Thaler's attorney made a emBatsonem objection -- arguing that the strike was racially motivated. The judge, who was not resent during jury interviews, found that the strike was race neutral and denied the emBatsonem objection. The case roceeded to trial and Mr. Haynes was convicted and sentenced to death.On aeal, Mr. Haynes argued that """"a trial judge who did not witness the actual emvoir direem cannot, as a matter of law, fairly evaluate a emBatsonem challenge."""" The Texas Court of Criminal Aeals rejected the argument and affirmed the conviction. Mr. Haynes then filed for and was denied habeas corus relief by a Texas federal district court. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit granted review. It held that the Texas Court of Criminal Aeals made an unreasonable alication of U.S. Sureme Court recedent in its decision and Mr. Haynes warranted federal habeas corus relief."
"Jose Angel Carachuri-Rosendo was admitted to the United States in 1993 and became a lawful ermanent resident. In 2004, he led guilty to misdemeanor ossession of marijuana. One year later, he led guilty to misdemeanor ossession of Xanax, but was not tried as a recidivist. In 2006, Mr. Carachuri was notified that he was removable from the United States. He alied for removal cancellation, which was denied. The Board of Immigration Aeals affirmed the decision.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that Mr. Carachuri was ineligible for cancellation of removal. The court reasoned that because Mr. Carachuri's second drug conviction could have been unished as a felony under the Controlled Substances Abuse Act, had he been rosecuted in federal court, the conviction qualified as an """"aggravated felony"""" making him ineligible for cancellation of removal."
"Joseh Kindler was convicted of first degree murder in a Pennsylvania state court and sentenced to death. He subsequently filed motions for ost-conviction relief, but while the motions were ending, he escaed from rison. Pennsylvania immediately moved to dismiss the motions arguing that Mr. Kindler had waived any right to have his ost-conviction motions considered because he was a fugitive. The trial court agreed and dismissed them. After recature, Mr. Kindler moved to reinstate his ost-conviction motions, which was denied. Both the Pennsylvania Suerior Court and Pennsylvania Sureme Court affirmed the trial court's decision.In 2000, Mr. Kindler filed a etition for federal habeas corus relief in a Pennsylvania federal district court. The State of Pennsylvania argued that habeas corus relief was unavailable to Mr. Kindler because Pennsylvania's fugitive waiver rule was an """"indeendent and adequate"""" state ground that recluded federal habeas review. The district court disagreed and granted the etition. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. Relying on its decision in emDoctor v. Waltersem, it held that Pennsylvania's fugitive waiver rule was not an indeendent and adequate state ground that recluded federal habeas review."
"A New York federal district court convicted Glenn Marcus of violating sex trafficking and forced labor rovisions of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (""""TVPA""""). The TVPA was enacted after Mr. Marcus engaged in some of the behavior for which he was charged. Yet, the jury was not instructed as to the date when the TVPA was enacted in relation to Mr. Marcus' allegedly illegal behavior. On aeal, he argued that the TVPA was alied retroactively, and, thus, violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution. The United States Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit agreed and reversed the district court. Alying a """"lain-error"""" standard of review, the court held that Mr. Marcus was entitled to a new trial on Ex Post Facto grounds. The court reasoned that if it was ossible for the jury, who had not been given instructions regarding the date of the TVPA's enactment, to convict exclusively on the defendant's re-enactment conduct, then the conviction violates the Ex Post Facto clause."
"Four former executives of Hollinger International were convicted of mail and wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. Section 1346 by an Illinois federal district court. In art, they had aid themselves $5.5 million in fees without the knowledge of the comany's audit committee or board of directors. At trial, the jury was instructed that it could find the defendants guilty if it deemed they had schemed to derive Hollinger and its shareholders """"of their intangible right to the honest services of the cororate officers, directors, or controlling shareholders of Hollinger,"""" and if the objective of the scheme was """"rivate gain."""" On aeal, the defendants exlained that while their objective was """"rivate gain,"""" the comensation had been crafted in order to avoid aying taxes to the Canadian government. Therefore, they argued that because their """"rivate gain"""" was intended to be urely at the exense of the Canadian government and not the comany, their actions did not violate the intent of Section 1346.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit disagreed and affirmed the district court. It held that the derivation of honest services owed to an emloyer is not mitigated simly because the inducement was a tax benefit obtained from a third arty. The court reasoned that had the defendants disclosed to Hollinger's audit committee and board of directors that the comensation was meant to bring about tax benefits, the committee and board very well may have reduced the ay-out in light of the tax benefits."
"An Alabama state court convicted Billy Joe Magwood of murder and sentenced him to death. Subsequently, an Alabama federal district court artially granted Mr. Magwood's etition for federal habeas corus relief. The court uheld his conviction but instructed the state court to look at mitigating evidence when resentencing Mr. Magwood. Uon resentencing, the state court sentenced Mr. Magwood to death once again. Mr. Magwood filed a second etition for federal habeas corus relief with the federal district court arguing that a judicial rule was retroactively alied in his case and that he lacked effective counsel at sentencing. The district court granted the etition and vacated Mr. Magwood's death sentence.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh circuit reversed, holding that risoners may not raise challenges to an original sentence that could have been raised in an earlier etition. The court also held that Mr. Magwood's counsel was not ineffective because he failed to raise an argument that had already been decided by the state's highest court adverse to his client's osition."
"Robert Stevens was convicted under 18 U.S.C. Section 48 in a Pennsylvania federal district court for """"knowingly selling deictions of animal cruelty with the intention of lacing those deictions in interstate commerce for commercial gain."""" His conviction stems from an investigation into the selling of videos related to illegal dog fighting. Mr. Stevens aealed his conviction arguing that 18 U.S.C. Section 48, on its face, was unconstitutional because it violated the Free Seech Clause of the First AmendmentThe U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit agreed with Mr. Stevens and reversed his conviction, holding unconstitutional 18 U.S.C. Section 48. The court reasoned that the dog fighting videos he sold were rotected seech and that 18 U.S.C. Section 48 did not serve a comelling governmental interest."
"A Florida state court convicted George Porter of murder and sentenced him to death. After exhausting his state court remedies, Mr. Porter filed for habeas corus relief in a Florida federal district court. He argued that his attorney's failure to bring forward evidence about his war record and how it left him a changed man violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel. The district court agreed and granted the etition. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed on the ground that the Florida Sureme Court's determination that Mr. Porter was not rejudiced by any deficient erformance by his counsel was a reasonable alication of emStrickland v. Washingtonem."
"A Massachusetts federal district court convicted Martin O'Brien and Arthur Burgess of attemted robbery and related weaons crimes. One of the weaons used by the defendants was an AK-47 assault rifle. At a re-trial conference, the district court ruled that the nature of the weaon (i.e. semi-automatic, automatic, etc.) was an element of the crime and, thus, a matter for the jury to decide. After sentencing, the government aealed, arguing that the nature of the weaon was a sentencing element, and, thus a matter for the judge to decide. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit affirmed, holding that under 18 U.S.C. Section 924(c) the nature of the weaon is an element of the crime that must be decided by the jury """"beyond a reasonable doubt."""""
"A Virginia federal district court remanded Bridget Hardt's claim for long-term disability benefits from Reliance Standard Life Insurance (""""Reliance""""). The court asked Reliance to reconsider its denial of Ms. Hardt's claim. Uon remand and after Ms. Hardt resented new evidence, Reliance changed its earlier stance and awarded Ms. Hardt full long-term disability benefits. Ms. Hardt then filed a motion for attorneys' fees based on her status as a revailing arty. The district court granted her motion and awarded her $39,149 in fees.On aeal, Reliance argued that Ms. Hardt was not a """"revailing arty"""" as understood by the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act and thus was not eligible for an award of attorneys' fees. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed and reversed the district court. The court held that the district court's decision to remand Ms. Hardt's claim to Reliance did not constitute an enforceable judgment that Ms. Hardt revailed on her claim because Reliance could have decided to deny her coverage."
"In 2006, Norman Carenter, a Shift Suervisor at a Mohawk Industry manufacturing facility, was fired after violating Mohawk's Code of Ethics. He subsequently filed suit for wrongful termination in a Georgia federal district court. He argued that he was fired, not for violating comany rotocols, but for reorting immigration violations to Mohawk's human resources deartment. Mr. Carenter stated that after filing his reort, a Mohawk comany attorney met with him and attemted to ersuade him to recant. The reort would have been detrimental to Mohawk as it was then involved in a class action lawsuit which charged the comany with consiring to hire illegal immigrants.Before trial and as art of discovery, Mr. Carenter requested information from Mohawk related to his meeting with its attorney. Mohawk contended that the information was rotected by the attorney-client rivilege. The federal district court ordered Mohawk to disclose the information, but ermitted the comany to aeal. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction to review the order for discovery. It reasoned that while the Sureme Court's decision in emCohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Cor.em rovided an excetion to the finality requirement necessary for an aellate court to have jurisdiction over aeals, the aeal of a discovery order involving attorney-client rivilege did not qualify for excetion."
"In 1994, Holly Wood was convicted in an Alabama state court of caital murder during a first-degree burglary and sentenced to death. Both the Alabama Court of Criminal Aeals and the Alabama Sureme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. Mr. Wood subsequently filed for ost-conviction relief under Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, arguing that he was mentally retarded and thus not eligible for a death sentence and that his trial counsel was ineffective. The Rule 32 court disagreed and denied his etition. Mr. Wood then filed for federal habeas corus relief in an Alabama federal district court. The district court granted relief, agreeing that Mr. Wood's counsel was ineffective at sentencing because they failed to resent evidence of Mr. Wood's deficient intellectual deficiencies.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed. It held that Mr. Wood's counsel was not ineffective. The court reasoned that Mr. Wood's attorneys acted reasonably when they decided it was in Mr. Wood's best interest to leave out information that illustrated his mental deficiencies. Moreover, the court recognized that while Mr. Wood's counsel included an inexerienced attorney, he merely acted as an assistant to the two exerienced attorneys chiefly resonsible for the case."
"Michael Barber etitioned for habeas corus relief in a federal district court. Mr. Barber argued that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) inaccurately calculated his good time credit toward the service of his federal sentence. The good time credit statute rovides that a risoner """"may receive credit toward the service of his sentence… of u to 54 days at the end of each year of the risoner's term."""" Mr. Barber argued that the BOP should calculate good time credit based on the sentence imosed rather than the time an inmate has actually served in rison. The district court denied his etition.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, citing its decision in emTablada v. Danielsem as controlling. There, the court held uheld the BOP's method for calculating good time credit. The court had reasoned that the good time credit statute was ambiguous and the BOP's interretation of the statute was reasonable."
"In 2007, Wanda Kruski booked a tri with Costa Cruise Lines. On February 21 while on the tri, Ms. Kruski allegedly tried over a loose cable and broker her femur. She filed suit in a Florida federal district court against Costa Cruise Lines. One year and four days after her alleged injury, Costa Cruise Lines informed Ms. Kruski that it was merely the North American sales and booking agent for the carrier, Costa Crociere. The district court allowed Ms. Kruski to amend her comlaint to include Costa Crociere and dismissed the action against Costa Cruise Lines. Costa Crociere then moved for summary judgment arguing the ticket sold to Ms. Kruski stiulated that suits must be filed against it within one year of the alleged injury. Therefore, Ms. Kruski was out of time. The district court agreed and granted Costa Crociere's motion for summary judgment.On aeal, Ms. Kruski argued that her amended comlaint against Costa Crociere related back to her original filing and thus should be considered timely filed against Costa Crociere. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit disagreed and affirmed the district court. The court held that her amended comlaint did not relate back to her original comlaint. The court reasoned that Ms. Kruski was aware that Costa Crociere was the carrier all along. Thus, to relate her amended comlaint back to the original comlaint was not the sort of mistaken identity correction contemlated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure15(c)(1)(C)."
"When Joe Sullivan was 13 years old, he was convicted of sexual battery by a Florida state court and sentenced to life in rison without arole. On aeal to the District Court of Aeal of Florida, Mr. Sullivan argued that his sentence was cruel and unusual and thus violated both the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court of aeals affirmed Mr. Sullivan's sentence without comment."
"Shiers sued the ocean carrier and rail carrier it used to shi roducts from China to the United States in a California state court to recover for damages. During the transort of the shiers' roducts, a train derailed damaging the roducts. The case was removed to a California federal district court only to be dismissed. The district court held that the contracts between the arties did not cover claims for cargo damage.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the district court erred in its analysis. The court reasoned that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (""""COGSA"""") does not govern the inland transort of goods, unless the arties oted out of coverage by the Carmack Amendment to Interstate Commerce Act. The Carmack Amendment governs damage claims against motor and rail carriers, and narrowly limits the venues in which such suits can be brought. Because the district court did not consider whether the arties oted out of the COGSA by the Carmack Amendment, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case for that determination."
"The City of New York sued several out-of-state cigarette vendors under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations Act (RICO) for failing to reort sales made to individuals over the Internet as required by the federal Jenkins Act. The State of New York and City of New York rely on this information to collect taxes imosed on cigarettes sold in the state and city. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the City of New York's suit, holding that its claim did not meet the """"causation"""" requirements set forth under RICO. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that the City of New York met the RICO """"causation"""" requirements and thus maintained a cause of action. The court reasoned that the defendants' conduct revented the City from collecting taxes and thus directly injured it. Moreover, the court reasoned that the loss of taxes injured the City's """"business or roerty."""""
"These cases involve malractice suits against Public Health Service (""""PHS"""") emloyees. The laintiffs filed actions recognized by emBivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcoticsem in a California federal district court alleging violations of the Fifth and Eighth Amendments. The PHS sought a dismissal arguing that the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) reemted emBivensem claims. The district court rejected the argument and denied the motion to dismiss.On aeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that FTCA did not reemt emBivensem claims. The court reasoned that the FTCA was enacted six months rior to the Sureme Court's decision in emBivensem and, thus, could not have been intended as a substitute."
"Shady Grove Orthoedics Associates (Shady Grove), on behalf of a class of laintiffs, sued Allstate Insurance Comany (Allstate) in art for Allstate's alleged failure to ay interest enalties on overdue insurance ayments as rescribed by New York statute. Allstate moved to dismiss relying on New York's rules of civil rocedure which instruct that class action lawsuits are inaroriate unless secifically rescribed by statute. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York agreed that Shady Grove's class action claim was not authorized and thus dismissed its claim.On aeal, Shady Grove argued that the New York rules of civil rocedure conflict with Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and thus were not alicable. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit disagreed with Shady Grove and affirmed the district court. The Second Circuit, reasoning from the Sureme Court's decision in emErie Railroad Co. v. Tomkinsem, stated that the New York rules of civil rocedure did not conflict with Rule 23 and thus Rule 23 did not control."
"Brian Russell Dolan leaded guilty to assault resulting in bodily harm in the New Mexico federal district court. He was sentenced to twenty-one months in rison and ordered to ay the victim $250 er month in restitution. Mr. Dolan aealed arguing that because the district court failed to award restitution within ninety days of Mr. Dolan's sentencing, the district court lacked the authority to do so.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court. The court held that the time limits established by the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act are not jurisdictional and, thus, the district court's tardiness in entering the order does not relieve the defendant of his obligation to ay."
"Current and former emloyees of Xerox Cor. sued the comany in a New York federal district court under the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act (""""ERISA""""). Plaintiffs had left the emloyer, been aid a lum sum, and after rehire had alleged Xerox imroerly calculated their benefits. Xerox argued that release forms signed by some of the laintiffs barred their ERISA claims. The district court disagreed and then crafted a remedy to comensate the laintiffs for their lost benefits.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit held that the district court crafted an aroriate remedy, but erred in finding that the release forms signed by some laintiffs were unenforceable. Rather, the court reasoned that the release forms were signed knowingly and voluntarily, making them enforceable."
"In 1995, a storm hit arts of western North Carolina causing extensive flooding and erosion. Graham and Cherokee Counties alied for assistance under the Emergency Watershed Protection Program (""""EWPP""""). Under the rogram, the counties would erform or hire to erform the necessary cleanu and reair work, aying for 25% of the costs, while the United States Deartment of Agriculture aid for the rest. During the cleanu, Karen Wilson, a secretary for the Graham Conservation District, raised concerns that she had about the legality of the awarded contracts. She filed suit in a North Carolina federal district court against Graham and Cherokee Counties, among others, under the False Claims Act. She alleged a consiracy that tainted the execution of the EWPP contracts and rendered the claims for reimbursement false within the meaning of the False Claims Act. The defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that the information underlying Ms. Wilson's claim was ublic disclosure and thus barred the court jurisdiction over the case. The court agreed and dismissed.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed. It held that the audit reorts that underlied Ms. Wilson's claim was not ublic disclosure for the urose of the False Claim Act, and thus the district court was not barred from hearing her case."
"A California state court convicted Fernando Belmontes of murder and sentenced him to death. After exhausting his state court remedies, Mr. Belmontes filed for habeas corus relief in a California federal district court arguing that at sentencing his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel was violated. The district court denied the etition.On aeal, the U.S Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and granted the etition. The court held that Mr. Belmontes did suffer ineffective counsel at sentencing. The court reasoned that Mr. Belmontes' attorney failed to reare and resent sufficient evidence to humanize Mr. Belmontes that may have mitigated his sentence."
"On January 29, 1994, around 1:00 a.m., nine-year-old Jane Doe was raed in the bedroom of her trailer in Carlin, Nevada. Troy Brown and his brother Travis lived in the same trailer ark as Jane Doe. Their brother Trent and his wife lived in a trailer across the street from Jane Doe's trailer. Both Troy and Trent were acquainted with Jane Doe's family, but Jane did not know Travis.That night, Troy drank at least ten shots of vodka followed by beer chasers; he was so drunk that he vomited on himself after leaving a bar at 12:15 a.m. Two witnesses saw a man stumbling between the Browns' trailer and that of Jane Doe's family around 1:00 a.m. Jane Doe called her mother to reort the rae at aroximately 1:00 a.m.; according to Troy, he returned to his trailer from the bar at aroximately 1:30 a.m, theoretically giving him enough time to assault Jane Doe.Troy Brown was arrested and charged with two counts of sexual assault on a child, attemted murder, and abuse and neglect of a child resulting in substantial mental harm.There was a large amount of conflicting evidence drawn from Jane Doe's testimony and from the crime scene itself. Most relevantly, the state's exert tested semen taken from Jane Doe's underwear. She determined that the DNA matched Troy's and testified that the robability it belonged to another erson from the general oulation was 1 in 3,000,000. Troy Brown's family tested the semen indeendently and found a random match robability of 1 in 10,000, but this was not introduced into evidence at trial. The jury found Troy Brown guilty of sexual assault and abuse and neglect of a child and sentenced him to life in rison with the ossibility of arole after 10 years.On aeal, Brown argued that double jeoardy barred the dulication of sexual assault charges, that the DNA evidence was imroerly admitted, and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The Nevada Sureme Court vacated the charge for abuse and neglect and remanded to the trial court for sentencing. The trial court again sentenced Brown to life in rison. His etition for ost-conviction relief was denied.On aeal to the district court, Brown claimed that the state's evidence was legally insufficient to rove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, using the habeas corus review develoed by the Court in emJackson v. Virginiaem. Brown submitted a reort reared by Laurence Mueller, a rofessor in ecology and evolutionary biology (""""Mueller reort""""). The Mueller Reort suggested that the rosecution's random match robability gave an imroer imression that the likelihood of Troy Brown's innocence was also 1 in 3,000,000. It also questioned the state exert's testimony on the robability that one of Troy Brown's brothers would match the DNA samle, arguing that the likelihood of a match to one of Troy's brothers was as high as 1 in 66. The district court sulemented the record with the Mueller Reort, as it was not resented to any state court.The district court then set aside the state's DNA testimony as unreliable and held that no rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The U.S. Court of Aeals, Ninth Circuit, affirmed the district court's ruling in a divided decision. It held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by sulementing the record with the Mueller reort and that the admission of the state's DNA evidence was a due rocess violation and a violation of federal law."
"A victim who obtained a civil rotection order (""""CPO"""") against John Robertson moved to hold him in criminal contemt for violating the order.

Pursuant to standard ractice, she listed equiment related to her catering business as """"exemt"""" from the bankrutcy roceedings and valued the equiment at over $10,000. Trustee William Schwab indeendently had Ms. Reilly's business equiment araised at over $17,000. He then sought a motion for the Bankrutcy Court to sell Ms. Reilly's equiment and turn over the roceeds, less the value of her exemtion. Ms. Reilly countered that the business equiment had become fully exemt when Mr. Schwab failed to timely object when she listed the equiment as exemt. The Bankrutcy Court agreed and denied Mr. Schwab's motion to sell off Ms. Reilly's equiment. A federal district court in Pennsylvania affirmed the Bankrutcy Court. On aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit, the court affirmed, holding that Mr. Schwab's failure to file a timely objection to Ms. Reilly's exemtion barred him from moving to sell the roerty."
"Seventeen ethnic Uighurs, Chinese citizens detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval- Base, Cuba sought federal habeas corus relief in the District of Columbia federal district court. The etitioners argued that since they were no longer considered """"enemy combatants"""" they were entitled to transfer and release from Guantanamo Bay. The etitioners feared that a transfer to China would lead to their arrest, torture, or execution. Therefore, they sought a transfer to the United States where they could be released safely. The district court granted the etition and ordered their transfer and release into the United States.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court, holding that the district court lacked authority to order the etitioners' transfer and release into the United States. The court reasoned that only the olitical branches of government may determine the admissibility of aliens into the United States. Without secific authorization by statute, treaty, or the Constitution, the district court could not grant the relief sought by the etitioners."
"Investors brought a securities fraud class action suit against Merck &am; Co. in a New Jersey federal district court. They alleged the comany had misled investors about the drug Vioxx's safety and commercial viability. Merck moved to dismiss the claim arguing that the investors had been ut on """"inquiry notice"""" more than two years before they filed suit, and thus the statute of limitations had run. The federal district court agreed and dismissed the suit.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed. It recognized that under the """"inquiry notice"""" standard, laintiffs are ut on notice for the urose of the statute of limitations in federal securities fraud litigation at the """"ossibility"""" of wrongdoing. Moreover, the court held that the investors had not been ut on """"inquiry notice"""" more than two years before they filed suit, and thus the statute of limitation had not run."
"The Chicago Police Deartment seized roerty belonging to the laintiffs, using the ower granted it by the Illinois Drug Asset Forfeiture Procedure Act (DAFPA). The laintiffs filed suit in an Illinois federal district court under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 arguing that when roerty is seized under the DAFPA, due rocess requires a romt, ostseizure, robable cause hearing. The district court dismissed, but the laintiffs asked for a rehearing in light of emMathews v. Eldridgeem, which rohibited the seizure of real roerty without a rior hearing. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit granted review.On aeal, the Seventh Circuit held that the DAFPA did not rovide adequate due rocess for an owner to contest the seizure of his roerty, reasoning the length of time between seizure and contest was too long (a maximum of 97 to 187 days). The court remanded the case and instructed the district court to devise a mechanism by which an owner can contest the validity of the retention of his roerty."

"Several suits were filed against Chicago and Oak Park in Illinois challenging their gun bans after the Sureme Court issued its oinion in emDistrict of Columbia v. Hellerem. In that case, the Sureme Court held that a District of Columbia handgun ban violated the Second Amendment. There, the Court reasoned that the law in question was enacted under the authority of the federal government and, thus, the Second Amendment was alicable. Here, laintiffs argued that the Second Amendment should also aly to the states. The district court dismissed the suits. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed."
"In August 2003, a detective from the Hagerstown, MD Police Deartment interviewed Michael Blain Shatzer Sr. regarding allegations that he had sexually abused his three-year old child. At the time, Mr. Shatzer was incarcerated on an unrelated offense involving sexual abuse of another child. After Mr. Shatzer invoked his Fifth Amendment rights to counsel and to remain silent, the interview was terminated. The investigation was subsequently closed, only to be reoened in January 2006 on the romting of Mr. Shatzer's wife, when she recognized her child could make more secific allegations about Mr. Shatzer's alleged sexual abuse. Thereafter in March 2006, another detective from the Hagerstown Police Deartment, who was aware that Mr. Shatzer had been under investigation, but was not aware that Mr. Shatzer had reviously invoked his Fifth Amendment rights to counsel and to remain silent, interviewed him. At this interview, Mr. Shatzer was advised of his Fifth Amendment rights, which he waived, and then confessed to secific instances of sexual abuse involving his child.Prior to trial, Mr. Shatzer moved to suress the confessions he made in the March 2006 interview arguing that his 2003 invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights was still alicable. Under emEdwards v. Arizonaem rendered the confession inadmissible. The motion was denied and a Maryland trial court convicted him of sexual child abuse. On aeal, the Court of Aeals of Maryland reversed, holding that the rotections of emEdwardsem alies for an inmate who has been continually incarcerated and had reviously invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, until either counsel is made available or the inmate initiates further conversation with olice. Therefore, under the circumstances, Mr. Shatzer's confession was inadmissible."
"Granite Rock Co. filed suit against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters under the Labor Management Relations Act (""""LMRA"""") in a California federal district court. Granite Rock argued that a Teamsters strike constituted a breach of a no-strike clause in their collective bargaining agreement (""""CBA""""). The district court dismissed the case, finding that Granite Rock failed to state a claim, and denied Granite Rock's request to comel arbitration in order to determine if the CBA had been ratified.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that while Granite Rock's claim against the Teamsters was outside the scoe of the LMRA, the disute should be arbitrated. The court reasoned that both arties consented to arbitration when Teamsters asserted the arbitration clause in its filings and when Granite Rock sued under the contract which included the arbitration clause."
"A Michigan state court convicted Van Chester Thomkins of first-degree murder, assault with intent to commit murder, and several firearms related charges. After exhausting his remedies in Michigan state court, Thomkins etitioned for habeas corus relief in a Michigan federal district court. The district court denied the etition.On aeal, Thomkins argued that his confession was obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment and that he was denied effective counsel at trial. The Sixth Circuit held that the Michigan Sureme Court's finding that Thomkins waived his Fifth Amendment right was unreasonable because Thomkins refused to sign an acknowledgement that he had been informed of his emMirandaem rights and rarely made eye contact with the officer throughout the three hour interview. The Sixth Circuit also held that the Michigan Sureme Court imroerly determined that Thomkins was not rejudiced by his counsel's failure to request a limiting instruction related to his searately tried co-defendant's testimony."
"Timothy Abbott, a British citizen, and Jacquelyn Abbott, an American citizen, litigated their divorce in the Chilean courts. Mrs. Abbott was awarded custody of their son, while Mr. Abbott was awarded visitation rights. At Mrs. Abbott's request, the Chilean court entered an order rohibiting the child's removal from Chile by either the father or mother without exress mutual consent. One year later, Mrs. Abbott moved the child from Chile without Mr. Abbott's consent. Uon location of the child in Texas, Mr. Abbott requested an order in a Texas federal district court that the child be returned to Chile ursuant to the Hague Convention on the Civil Asects of International Child Abduction. The district court denied the order holding that the child's removal did not constitute a breach of the father's """"rights of custody"""" as defined by the Hague convention.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Chilean court's order and Chilean statute that required father's consent before the child could leave Chile did not give a non-custodial father """"rights of custody"""" within the meaning of the Hague Convention. The court stated that Mr. Abbott merely ossessed the rights of """"access to the child."""""
"Agron Kucana, a citizen of Albania, entered the United States in 1995 and did not leave when his visa exired. Mr. Kucana alied for asylum but failed to aear at his hearing, after which he was ordered removed from the United States. He filed a motion to reoen his case, which was denied. On aeal, the Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) affirmed. After failing to remove himself from the United States, Mr. Kucana once again moved to reoen his case, contending that conditions in Albania had deteriorated to the extent where his life would be in danger uon his return. His motion was denied.On aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit, he argued that the BIA """"abused its discretion"""" in denying his claim when it failed to consider an affidavit testifying to the dangerous conditions existing in Albania. The Seventh Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction to review the matter. It found that the BIA's decision not to reoen Mr. Kucana's case was """"discretionary."""" 8 U.S.C. Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) rovides that """"no court has jurisdiction to review"""" any decision that is under the discretion of the BIA.

"The Free Enterrise Fund, a non-rofit organization, brought suit challenging the constitutionality of Title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It alleged that the creation of the Public Comany Oversight Board (the Board) by the Act violated the Aointments Clause because it derived the President from exercising adequate control over the Board. However, the Board itself was under the direct suervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), all of whose commissioners are aointed by and can be removed by the President.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit held that the creation of the Public Comany Accounting Oversight Board did not violate either the Aointments Clause or the searation of owers rincile. It reasoned that the Board's members were inferior officers under the suervision of the SEC and thus were not obligated to be aointed by the President. Also, the court noted that the President's ability to remove members of the SEC, who in turn could remove members of the Board, reserved the Constitution's searation of owers."
"A Michigan state court convicted Diaolis Smith of second degree murder and felony ossession of a firearm and sentenced him to life in rison. After exhausting his remedies in the Michigan state courts, Smith etitioned for habeas corus relief in a Michigan federal district court. The district court denied the etition. On aeal, Smith argued that he was denied an imartial jury from a fair cross-section of the community in violation of the Sixth Amendment.The Sixth Circuit held that the Michigan Sureme Court unreasonably alied federal law in concluding that county jury selection """"worked no systematic exclusion."""" The Court reasoned the state trial court's olicy of excusing otential jurors for whom jury duty would constitute hardshi based on child care concerns or transortation issues, when viewed together with another olicy that assigned rosective jurors from the county's only large city, established a rima facie case of systematic under-reresentation of African- American jurors."
"Bruce Weyhrauch was charged in the Alaska federal district court in art with a """"scheme and artifice to defraud and derive the State of Alaska of its intangible right to [his] honest services."""" Mr. Weyhrauch was a member of the Alaska House of Reresentatives and allegedly took actions favorable to an Alaska oil comany, VECO Cor., in return for future emloyment. At trial, Mr. Weyhrauch moved to exclude evidence related to the honest services charge. The district court excluded the evidence because it would merely have shown that Alaska could have imosed a duty uon Mr. Weyhrauch to disclose the conflict of interest, and thus did not rove he had violated any duty imosed by state law.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. It held that 18 U.S.C. Section 1346 established a uniform standard for """"honest services"""" that governs every ublic official and that the government did not need to rove an indeendent violation of state law to sustain an honest services fraud conviction. Therefore, the court reasoned that because the district court excluded the evidence needed to rove that state law imosed an affirmative duty on Mr. Weyhrauch to disclose the conflict of interest, the evidence was admissible."
"African-American alicants for firefighter jobs in Chicago, IL sued the city under Title VII alleging the written test used for hiring had a disarate imact. After administering the test, the city graded the scores and laced alicants in three categories: """"well qualified,"""" """"qualified,"""" and """"not qualified."""" Because the city had only 600 ositions to fill among 1,782 """"well qualified"""" alicants, """"qualified"""" alicants were unlikely to get job offers. The class of laintiffs in this suit allege that the test disarately categorized them as """"qualified."""" An Illinois federal district court entered judgment in favor of the laintiffs.On aeal, the Seventh Circuit held that the laintiffs' suit was untimely and dismissed. The court stated that the 300 day limit for filing such a claim began when the laintiffs learned that they had been laced in the """"qualified"""" category and that the city would be hiring those in the """"well qualified"""" category. The court reasoned that because there was no fresh act of discrimination, the time for filing a Title VII claim began when the discriminatory decision was made and not when it was executed."
"An Indiana federal district court convicted Thomas Carr of violating the Sex Offender and Registration and Notification Act. The Act imoses enalties on anyone who is a convicted sex offender, and traveling in interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly fails to register as a sex offender, unless he roves that """"uncontrollable circumstances"""" revented him from doing so. On aeal, Carr argued that he did not violate the act because he traveled before the Act was assed. The Seventh Circuit held that the Act does not require that the defendant's travel ostdate its enactment, and, consequently, affirmed the district court."
"Emloyees of the City of Ontario, California olice deartment filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim in a California federal district court against the olice deartment, city, chief of olice, and an internal affairs officer. They alleged Fourth Amendment violations in relation to the olice deartment's review of text messages made by an emloyee on a city issued text-message ager. While the city did not have an official text-messaging rivacy olicy, it did have a general """"Comuter Usage, Internet and E-mail Policy."""" The olicy in art stated that """"[t]he City of Ontario reserves the right to monitor and log all network activity including e-mail and Internet use, with or without notice,"""" and that """"[u]sers should have no exectation of rivacy or confidentiality when using these resources."""" Emloyees were told verbally that the text-messaging agers were considered e-mail and subject to the general olicy. The district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in art. The court held that city emloyees had a reasonable exectation of rivacy for the text messages they sent on their city-issued agers because there was no text message rivacy olicy in lace. Moreover, the court noted that the olice deartment's review of the text messages was unreasonable because it could have used """"less intrusive methods"""" to determine whether emloyees' had roerly used the text messaging service."
"On the second day of jury deliberations in Reginald Lett's murder trial in a Michigan state court, the trial judge declared a mistrial because a juror asked what would haen if the jury did not agree. Mr. Lett was subsequently retried and convicted of second-degree murder and ossession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. After exhausting his state court remedies, including an aeal to the Michigan Sureme Court, Mr. Lett etitioned for a writ of habeas corus in a Michigan federal district court arguing that his retrial violated the Constitution's Double Jeoardy Clause. The federal district court granted the etition.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. The court recognized that a """"court may not force a defendant to undergo retrial on a matter that concluded without a conviction or acquittal unless there was a 'manifest necessity' for declaring a mistrial."""" While the court further recognized that a jury deadlock is a manifest necessity for declaring a mistrial, a trial judge's decision may only be uheld if it was based on an exercise of """"sound discretion."""" Here, the court concluded that the Michigan Sureme Court erred in finding that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion."
"A Texas federal district court convicted Jeffrey Skilling of consiracy, securities fraud, making false reresentations to auditors, and insider trading. Mr. Skilling was the former C.E.O. of Enron Cor. On aeal, he argued that the government rosecuted him under an invalid legal theory and that the jury was biased.The United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the conviction, but vacated Mr. Skilling's sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. The court first held that the government's theory under the """"Honest Services"""" fraud statute was valid. It reasoned that it was immaterial whether Enron's board of directors knew or even tacitly aroved of Mr. Skilling's fraudulent conduct when he withheld information that would lead a reasonable emloyer to change its conduct. Moreover, the court held that while Mr. Skilling roved that there was sufficient inflammatory and ervasive retrial ublicity to require a resumtion that rejudice tainted the jury, the government met its burden to show that jury screening was adequate, and that the district court did not emanel any juror who was unconstitutionally rejudiced."
"Curtis Johnson was convicted in a Florida federal district court for ossession of ammunition by a convicted felon. He was sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because the district court determined that his three earlier convictions constituted """"violent felonies."""" Mr. Curtis aealed arguing that one of his rior convictions was for battery and the Florida Sureme Court had held the Florida battery law did not constitute a """"violent felony.""""On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that Mr. Johnson's rior battery conviction under Florida law constituted a """"violent felony"""" under the ACCA. The court reasoned that the force requirement of the definition for a """"violent felony"""" was satisfied by the """"touching or striking"""" element under the state battery law."
"Plaintiffs sought a reliminary injunction in a Washington federal district court to revent the state of Washington from making referendum etitions available under the state's Public Records Act (""""PRA""""). In resonse to a etition titled """"Preserve Marriage, Protect Children,"""" laintiffs attemted to revent the release of the names and contact information of individuals who signed the etition. The laintiffs argued that, as alied to referendum etitions, the PRA violates the First Amendment because it is not narrowly tailored to serve a comelling government interest. The district court granted the injunction.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed holding that the PRA does not violate the First Amendment when alied to require ublic disclosure of etitions calling for a referendum. The court reasoned that even assuming that signing a etition qualifies as exressive conduct, and that alication of the PRA's ublic access rovision has an incidental effect on a referendum signer's seech by deterring some would-be signers, the aroriate level of constitutional inquiry is intermediate scrutiny, not strict scrutiny. Under intermediate scrutiny, the interests asserted by the state are sufficiently imortant to justify the law's incidental limitations of referendum etition signers' First Amendment freedoms."
"American Needle Inc. filed suit in an Illinois federal district court against the National Football League (""""NFL"""") and Reebok International Ltd. alleging that the teams' exclusive licensing agreement with Reebok violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. American Needle argued that because individual NFL teams searately own their team logos and trademarks, their collective agreement to authorize NFL Proerties to award the exclusive headwear license to Reebok, was in fact a consiracy to restrict other vendors' ability to obtain licenses for the teams' intellectual roerty. The district court disagreed and dismissed the case.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. It held that NFL teams were a single entity for uroses of antitrust laws, and thus could not have consired to restrict trade. Therefore, the court stated that the teams were free to license their intellectual roerty on an exclusive basis."
"Karen L. Jerman filed suit in an Ohio federal district against the law firm Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer &am; Ulrich for violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (""""FDCPA""""). The law firm had sought foreclosure on a roerty owned by Ms. Jerman and erroneously informed her that the FDCPA stated that the debt in question would be considered valid unless she disuted it in writing. Only later did the law firm discover that Ms. Jerman owed no debt and consequently withdrew its comlaint. Before trial, the law firm argued that while it violated the FDCPA, its error was a bona fide error, and thus a comlete defense to its actions. The district court agreed and dismissed the case.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the FDCPA error defense alies to mistakes of law. The court reasoned that the statutory language and legislative history behind the FDCPA did not indicate Congress intended it to aly solely to clerical errors."
"Plaintiffs brought a class action suit against Hertz in a California state court. Hertz moved to remove the case to a California federal district court based on diversity jurisdiction. The laintiffs argued that there was no diversity jurisdiction as Hertz's rincial lace of business was California and not New Jersey. The federal district court agreed and remanded the case to the state court.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the federal district court. It held that the district court correctly alied the """"lace of oerations test"""" to determine Hertz's rincial lace of business. Therefore, there was no diversity jurisdiction and the district court had no authority over the case."
"The Christian Legal Society Chater of the University of California, Hastings College of Law (CLS) filed suit against the university in a California federal district for violating its First Amendment rights. The Hastings College of Law failed to recognize the CLS as an official student organization because state law requires all registered student organizations to allow """"any student to articiate, become a member, or seek leadershi ositions, regardless of their status or beliefs."""" In contrast, CLS requires its members to attest in writing that """"I believe in: The Bible as the insired word of God; The Deity of our Lord, Jesus Christ, God's son; The vicarious death of Jesus Christ for our sins; His bodily resurrection and His ersonal return; The resence and ower of the Holy Sirit in the work of regeneration; [and] Jesus Christ, God's son, is Lord of my life."""" The district court dismissed the case.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the school's conditions on recognizing student grous were viewoint neutral and reasonable. Therefore, the school's conditions did not violate the CLS's First Amendment rights."
"Locomotive engineer Robert McBride filed suit after contending that he injured his hand while adding and removing railroad cars for his emloyer, CSX Transortation, Inc. Under the Federal Emloyers' Liability Act, a rail carrier is liable for worker injuries that result from negligence by the carrier. A trial judge instructed the jury that CSX caused or contributed to McBride's injury if its negligence """"layed a art, no matter how small, in bringing about the injury."""" The jury found for McBride and awarded him $184,250.CSX argued that McBride should have been required to rove that the comany's alleged negligence was a cause of the injury. But the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit disagreed, affirming the verdict."
"In November 2008, Stok &am; Associates, a Florida law firm, deosited a cashier's check for $173,015 from someone the firm thought was a client into its Citibank trust account. After Citibank acceted the check and made the funds available, the bank discovered the check was counterfeit and restricted Stok's use of the funds. The roblem was the firm had already wired the money to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Stok said Citibank then removed $173,015 from his trust account and notified the Florida Bar of the deficiency in the trust account.The firm filed a lawsuit in Florida state court, alleging fraud and breach of contract, among other things. Citibank meanwhile filed a etition in federal court to comel arbitration and stay the state court roceedings, ursuant to an arbitration clause that aears in the contract governing the arties' relationshi. The district court denied the motion to comel arbitration, but the United States Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed."
"Two hours after Hannah Bruesewitz received her six-month dihtheria, tetanus and ertussis vaccine in 1992, she started develoing seizures and was hositalized for weeks. Hannah has continued to suffer from residual seizure disorder that requires her to receive constant care, according to her arents. When their daughter was three-years-old, Russell and Robalee Bruesewitz filed a etition seeking comensation for her injuries. One month rior to the etition, new regulations eliminated Hannah's seizure disorder from the list of comensable injuries. The family's etition was denied. Three years later, in 1998, the drug comany Wyeth withdrew the tye of vaccine used in Hannah's inoculation from the market.The Bruesewitzes filed a lawsuit against Wyeth in state court in Pennsylvania. They claimed the drug comany failed to develo a safer vaccine and should be held accountable for reventable injuries caused by the vaccine's defective design. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act rotected Wyeth from lawsuits over vaccine injury claims. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the 3rd Circuit affirmed."
"Carol Anne Bond was found guilty of trying to oison her husband's mistress, Myrlinda Haynes, with toxic chemicals at least 24 times over the course of several months. A grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania charged Bond with two counts of ossessing and using a chemical weaon, in violation of a criminal statute imlementing the treaty obligations of the United States under the 1993 Chemical Weaons Convention. The grand jury also charged Bond with two counts of mail theft. Bond's attorneys argue that the statute was intended to deal with rogue states and terrorists and that their client should have been rosecuted under state law instead. Bond, a laboratory technician, stole the chemical otassium dichromate from the comany where she worked. Haynes was not injured. Bond's husband had a child with Haynes while married to Bond. Haynes had contacted olice and ostal authorities after finding the chemicals at her home. In Setember 2009, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit held that Bond lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on the basis of the Tenth Amendment."
"John Thomson sued the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office, the District Attorney, Harry Connick, in his official and individual caacities, and several assistant district attorneys in their official caacities under 42 U.S.C § 1983 in a Louisiana federal district court. Mr. Thomson served fourteen years on death row for a crime he did not commit because rosecutors failed to turn over blood work in a related case. The jury awarded Mr. Thomson $14 million against Mr. Connick in his official caacity. On aeal, an en banc U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit rendered a tie vote and; thus by rule, affirmed the district court."
"Jason Peer leaded guilty to consiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing methamhetamine in an Iowa federal district court. In the latest of a long-running series of aeals and remands, a newly assigned Iowa federal district court sentenced Mr. Peer to 77 months imrisonment and 12 months suervised release – a 20% downward dearture from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines advisory range. Thereafter, the district court granted the government's motion to reduce Mr. Peer's sentence further to 65 months imrisonment because of the assistance Mr. Peer rovided after he was initially sentenced. Mr. Peer aealed arguing in art that the district court should consider evidence of his ost-sentence rehabilitation to reduce his sentence further.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed Mr. Peer's sentence, holding in art that evidence of a defendant's ost-sentence rehabilitation was not relevant at resentencing. The court reasoned that Eighth Circuit recedent was clear that such evidence was not relevant."
"Alejandra Taia was convicted of bringing illegal aliens into the United States and of juming bail after being charged with immigration crimes. Following the jury trial, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California sentenced Taia to 51 months in rison, noting that one factor in giving her a longer sentence was to make sure she remained confined long enough to take art in a drug rehab rogram.Taia aealed the sentence, arguing that the district court committed lain error by basing her sentence on seculation about whether and when she could enter and comlete the Bureau of Prison's 500-hour drug abuse treatment rogram. But in Aril 2010, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the lower court order."

Although he had been romoted within the comany on ast occasions, in 2003, he was demoted from a managerial osition to a non-managerial slot. He then resigned. Kirk filed a comlaint with the Deartment of Labor in 2004 claiming his demotion was in violation of the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act. After his claim was denied by the deartment, he filed suit in the Southern District of New York in 2005 under the False Claims Act. Kirk claimed the comany was shirking its obligation to take affirmative stes to emloy and romote veterans, invite eligible veterans to identify themselves to emloyers and file annual reorts detailing the hiring and lacement of veterans.Using documentation sulied by FOIA requests submitted by his wife and his own knowledge of comany oerations, he claimed the comany failed to file reorts from 1998 until late 2004 and filed false reorts in 2004, 2005 and 2006, alleging that each claim for ayment on the hundreds of government contracts submitted by Schindler was a violation of the False Claims Act.The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the comlaint in March 2009 for failure to state a claim uon which relief can be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In Aril 2010, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit vacated the lower court order and remanded the case for further roceedings."

After exhausting his ost-conviction state court remedies, Mr. Moore etitioned for habeas corus relief in an Oregon federal district court. Mr. Moore argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to recognize that his taed confession was obtained unconstitutionally. The district court denied the etition.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and granted the etition. The court held that Mr. Moore's counsel's failure to suress Mr. Moore's confession was both constitutionally deficient and rejudicial under the standard set forth in emStrickland v. Washingtonem. The court was careful to note that even the state conceded the means by which the state elicited Mr. Moore's confession were unconstitutional because Mr. Moore's request for counsel had been ignored by the olice."
"Gladys Mensing took the drug metocloramide for four years to hel fight diabetic gastroaresis. She filed a lawsuit against the generic drug's manufacturers and distributors, contending that the drug gave her a severe neurological movement disorder, tardive dyskinesia, but none of the generic drug's manufacturers and distributors made any effort to include warnings on the label.Metocloramide manufacturers Pliva Inc. and Actavis Elizabeth LLC asked for the lawsuit to be thrown out, arguing that government regulations require th to have the same label on metocloramide as is on its brand-name equivalent, Reglan. Reglan did not have a warning about tardive dyskinesia while Mensing was taking metocloramide.A federal judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota agreed, saying the lawsuit was re-ted by the federal regulations requiring the two labels to match. But the U.S. Court of Aeals for the 8th Circuit overturned that ruling, holding that more should have been done to warn consumers about ossible risks."
"Arizona taxayers challenged the constitutionality of Arizona's tuition tax credit in an Arizona federal district court. They alleged the tax credit violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because it funneled money to rivate religious schools. The district court dismissed the case.

"A California state court convicted Charles Martin of robbery and murder and sentenced him to life in rison without the ossibility of arole. Subsequently, Mr. Martin filed a round of habeas etitions in state court – all of which were denied. He then raised several new claims in etitions for federal habeas relief in a California federal district court. The court denied to examine the claims because they were not yet exhausted in state court. After Mr. Martin exhausted these last claims in state court, he returned to federal court for federal habeas corus relief. The district court again denied the etition relying on California's statute of limitations for filing state habeas corus etitions.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court, holding that California's statute of limitations could not oerate as an indeendent and adequate state ground to bar federal habeas corus review. The court reasoned that California's statute of limitations was not sufficiently defined, nor consistently alied such that it could bar Mr. Martin's etition."
"The families of two North Carolina teenagers killed in a bus crash in France brought suit in North Carolina state court, alleging faulty tires.

"Harry Mitts drank bourbon until he became intoxicated and then shot and killed an African American man, while seaking racial eithets. During the olice shoot-out that followed, Mitts shot and killed one olice officer and wounded two others before being arehended. At trial, Mitts did not contest the evidence roving that he had killed two men, but he instead attemted to establish that he was too intoxicated to form the required intent to kill. After a enalty hearing, the jury recommended the death enalty on both aggravated murder counts and terms of imrisonment for the attemted murders.The trial court sentenced Mitts to death for the aggravated murders and to terms of imrisonment for the attemted murders. The Ohio Court of Aeals affirmed Mitts' convictions and sentences, and the Ohio Sureme Court affirmed the convictions and sentences and denied rehearing, ruling that the trial court should have instructed the jury to merge dulicative death enalty secifications, but holding that the error did not influence the jury and was resolved by re-weighing on aeal.Mitts filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus. A federal judge in Cleveland affirmed the sentence, but the United States Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit decided to vacate."
"Craig and Wendy Humhries were accused of abuse by one of their children, arrested, and their children were taken away from them. They were charged with child abuse and felony torture, but the charges were dismissed once it became clear the allegations were not true. Desite the fact that the charges were dismissed, the Humhries were laced on California's Child Abuse Central Index (""""CACI"""") – a database for known and susected child abusers. The Humhries subsequently filed suit against Los Angeles County and various County officials in a California federal district court. The Humhries argued that California's maintenance of the CACI violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because identified individuals are not given fair oortunity to challenge the allegations against them. The district court dismissed their claims.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed holding that the erroneous listing of the Humhries on the CACI violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

He was held for 16 days as a material witness in the terrorism trial of Sami Omar al-Hussayen. Al-Kidd has since argued the government classified him as a material witness because it lacked enough evidence to hold him as a susect. He filed a lawsuit against then-Attorney General John Ashcroft ersonally, claiming that he created and authorized a rogram that allegedly misused the material witness statute to detain susected terrorists.The lawsuit did not go to trial and in Setember 2009, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected Ashcroft's bid for absolute immunity, holding that it didn't aly because the government's motive for arresting Al-Kidd allegedly had nothing to do with the al-Hussayen rosecution."
"Three members of the Williamson family were involved in a head-on collision with another vehicle. Delbert and Alexa wore lashoulder seatbelts and survived, while Thanh wore a la-only seatbelt and died. Subsequently, they sued Mazda Motor of America for strict roducts liability, negligence, deceit, and wrongful death in a California state court. The court dismissed the claims, holding that federal law recluded a state court tort action """"to the extent the theory of liability [was rooted in] the la-only seat belt."""" On aeal, a California aellate court affirmed, holding that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (""""NHTSA"""") regulation allowing minivan rear seats to have either la-only or lashoulder seat belts reemted state court wrongful death actions."
"In these consolidated cases, the defendants engaged in drug trafficking while using a firearm. Both defendants received an additional five-year sentence for using or carrying a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime ursuant to 18 U.S.C § 924(c)(1)A), even though they received longer mandatory minimum sentences under the Armed Career Criminal Act. On aeal, they argued that the sentencing enhancement rovided by 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)A) should run concurrently with their already longer minimum sentences.

"Various business and civil-rights organizations challenged the enforceability of The Legal Arizona Worker's Act (""""LAWA"""") in an Arizona federal district court. They argued that federal law reemted LAWA, which requires Arizona emloyers to use the federal E-Verify emloyment verification system and revokes business licenses of those who hire unauthorized workers. The district court uheld the statute.On aeal the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that LAWA was not reemted exlicitly or imliedly by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act (""""IRCA""""). The court reasoned that IRCA although IRCA exressly reemts all state and local laws imosing sanctions for hiring or recruiting unauthorized aliens, it excets licensing laws – like LAWA – from reemtive reach. The court also reasoned that mandating the use of E-Verify is not imliedly reemted by IRCA because Congress could have, but did not, exressly forbid states form requiring E-Verify articiation."
"ComTel, a trade association that reresents some of AT&am;T's cometitors, filed a FOIA request with the Federal Communications Commision in 2005, seeking documents related to an FCC robe into whether AT&am;T had overcharged the agency for work on a technology education roject. AT&am;T fought the request, contending the roduction of the documents violated Exemtion 7(c) of FOIA, which exemts document disclosures in law enforcement records that would constitute an invasion of """"ersonal rivacy.""""The FCC rejected AT&am;T's argument, but in Setember 2009, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit held that the hrase """"ersonal rivacy"""" alied to cororations because other sections of FOIA had defined """"erson"""" as a cororation."

CSX argued that the tax discriminates against railroad comanies in violate of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (""""RRRR""""). The district court had granted a reliminary injunction, but of its own accord, dissolved the reliminary injunction and dismissed the case.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that the district court aroriately dismissed the action. The court reasoned that because it had already ruled in favor of the Alabama Deartment of Revenue on an identical challenge to the tax in emNorfolk S. R. v.

"In December 1993, a Rhode Island jury convicted Khalil Kholi on 10 counts of first-degree sexual assault. The charges stemmed from the alleged molestation of his two ste-daughters. A judge on the state suerior court sentenced Kholi to two consecutive terms of life imrisonment, and the state sureme court affirmed the conviction in February 1996. Kholi did not file a federal writ of habeas corus at that time. Instead, he filed a motion seeking sentence reduction as a form of ost-conviction relief, which was denied. Kholi exhausted his rocedural otions regarding sentence reduction in 2007, at which time he began his aeal for federal writ of habeas corus, which was well beyond the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act's standard one-year limitation on filing. In Setember 2009, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit reversed and remanded the district court's judgment that a etition for leniency is different from an aeal to correct legal errors and therefore does not result in a tolling of the statute of limitations under AEDPA. A circuit slit exists on the issue. The First Circuit's decision was in line with a Tenth Circuit ruling on the same issue, but the Third, Fourth and Eleventh Circuits have reviously ruled that a etition for leniency does not toll the statute of limitations under AEDPA."
"A grou of Halliburton Co. shareholders, led by the Erica P. John Fund, filed a lawsuit that contends that from 1999 to 2001, the Houston-based comany falsified earnings reorts, layed down estimated asbestos liability and overstated the benefits of a merger. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas denied the investors' motion for class certification in the case, holding that they couldn't sue as a grou because they hadn't established that they lost money as a result of the alleged fraud. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court order."
"The Virginia Office of Protection and Advocacy (""""VOPA""""), a state agency dedicated to advocating on behalf of ersons with disabilities, sued several Virginia state officials in their official caacities in a Virginia federal district court. VOPA alleged that the officials violated two federal statutes when the officials refused VOPA access to state records which VOPA argued it was entitled. The officials moved to dismiss the case arguing that they were immune to suit under the Eleventh Amendment.On aeal the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the district court, holding that the state officials were immune to suit under the Eleventh Amendment. The court reasoned that: (1) Congress did not abrogate state immunity under the statutes which VOPA sued under and (2) the mere receit of federal funds by Virginia under the two statutes did not mean that the state had consented to suit. The court declined to extend the Eleventh Amendment excetion established in emEx arte Youngem, where a rivate arty may seek rosective injunctive relief against state officials, noting that VOPA was not a rivate arty but rather a state agency."
"In 2007, the Vermont legislature assed a law that banned the sale, transmission or use of rescriber-identifiable data (''PI data'') for marketing or romoting a rescrition drug without the consent of the rescriber. The law also rohibited the sale, license or exchange for value of PI data for marketing or romoting a rescrition drug.Three comanies -- IMS Health, Verisan and Source Healthcare Analytics, a unit of Dutch ublisher Wolters Kluwer -- that collect and sell such data and by a trade grou for harmaceutical manufacturers challenged the law. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the 2nd Circuit struck down the measure, holding that it violated the First Amendment because it restricts the seech rights of data miners without directly advancing legitimate state interests."
"William Freeman was charged with one count of crack ossession, among other charges, and entered a lea agreement that included a sentence of 106 months. After his agreement was acceted by the trial judge and his sentence was entered, the U.S. Sentencing Commission amended the Sentencing Guidelines to reduce the disarity in the treatment of crack and owder cocaine, and made the amendment retroactive. Freeman sought to reduce his sentence accordingly.But in December 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky refused to do so. In November 2009, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed."
"More than 20 years ago, General Dynamics Cor. and McDonnell Douglas Cor. signed a contract to build eight A- 12 Avenger stealth fighters for the U.S. Navy at a total estimated cost of more than $4 billion. Three years later, the Navy and then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney declared the comany in default and canceled the contract. The government has argued that the comanies weren't able to roduce the aircraft as designed on schedule and is seeking reayment of $1.35 billion, lus more than $2.5 billion in accumulated interest, arguing that the comanies failed to meet the terms of the contract. Meanwhile, General Dynamics Cor. and Boeing Co., which inherited the litigation through its urchase of McDonnell Douglas, contend that the delay was caused by the government's refusal to share essential stealth technology.The government has argued that the comanies couldn't ress that argument because litigating the issue would require the disclosure of military secrets and jeoardize national security. Two lower courts agreed."
"A California trial court convicted Joshua Richter of burglary and murder. He exhausted his state court remedies and filed for habeas corus relief in a California federal district court. Mr. Richter argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. The district court denied the etition and was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit.However, uon rehearing emen bancem, the Ninth Circuit granted the etition, holding that the state court's determination that Mr. Richter was not denied effective assistance of counsel was unreasonable. The court reasoned that under emStrickland v. Washingtonem the defendant must show that """"counsel's erformance was deficient."""" And, the defendant must show that """"the deficient erformance rejudiced the defense."""" Here, the requirements of emStricklandem were met when Mr. Richter's counsel failed to conduct sufficient re-trial investigation to determine what forensic evidence or exerts would be useful to the defense's theory when it was foreseeable what evidence the state would introduce."
"Under the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), lan administrators must rovide all lan articiants with a """"summary lan descrition"""" (SPD), as well as a """"summary of material modifications"""" when material changes are made to the lan. After CIGNA converted its traditional defined benefit ension lan to a cash balance lan, it issued a summary lan descrition to lan articiants. In 2001, Janice Amara, one of the articiants, filed a class-action lawsuit, claiming that CIGNA failed to comly with ERISA's notice requirements and SPD rovisions. The U.S. District Court for the District Connecticut found for Amara, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, finding that the SPD misreresented the terms of the lan itself."

"A North Carolina boy identified as J.D.B. was 13-year-old secial education student in 2005 when the olice showed u at his school to question him about a string of neighborhood burglaries. The olice had learned that the boy was in ossession of a digital camera that had been reorted stolen.The boy was escorted to a school conference room, where he was interrogated in the resence of school officials. J.D.B.'s arents were not contacted, and he was not given any warnings about his rights under the 1966 decision in emMiranda v. Arizonaem, such as the right to remain silent or to have access to a lawyer. J.D.B. confessed to the crimes, but later sought to have his confession suressed on the basis that he was never read his Miranda rights. He argued that because he was effectively in olice custody when he incriminated himself, he was entitled to Miranda rotections. In December 2009, the North Carolina Sureme Court held that it could not consider the boy's age or secial education status in determining whether he was in custody, and because he was not in custody, he was not entitled to Miranda warnings."
"Michelle Ortiz, a former inmate, filed suit against several state and rison officials in an Ohio federal district court for violating her civil rights. While Ms. Ortiz served her sentence, she was sexually abused by a corrections officer on two consecutive nights. Prior to the second incident, Ms. Ortiz comlained to rison officials, but was told """"that the man was leaving,"""" """"this was his nature,"""" and he """"is just an old dirty man."""" The corrections officer assaulted her on the following night. At trial, the jury found in favor of Ms. Ortiz against two of the rison officials – Paula Jordan and Rebecca Bright.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the rison officials were entitled to qualified immunity and dismissed the case. The court noted that while courts do not normally review the denial of summary judgment after a trial on the merits, a denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is an excetion to the general rule. The court reasoned that Ms. Jordan's conduct did not violate Ms. Ortiz's Eight Amendment right to humane conditions because Ms. Jordan was not """"deliberately indifferent"""" to Ms. Ortiz's light."
"In 2005, Santa Clara County, Calif., filed a class-action lawsuit based on U.S. Deartment of Health and Human Services reorts, alleging that harmaceutical comanies have systemically overcharged hositals and clinics, making them ay millions of dollars more than necessary for rescrition drugs.

"David Henderson filed a claim for monthly comensation with the Deartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office based on his need for in-home care. The Regional Office denied the claim. Mr. Henderson aealed to the Board of Veterans' Aeals, which affirmed the Regional Office. He then filed a notice of aeal with the U.S. Court of Aeals for Veterans Claims fifteen days after the exiration of the 120-day aeal eriod set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 7266(a). The court of aeals denied the claim. The court of aeals held that it lacked jurisdiction because Mr. Henderson's notice of aeal was out of time and was not subject to equitable tolling."

Keith Smith and Shirley Serlazza filed a lawsuit in West Virginia state court in 2001, seeking class certification for Baycol users throughout the state. Meanwhile, a searate utative West Virginia class action, filed was removed to federal court and consolidated as art of a multidistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. In August 2008, the court denied certification on grounds that laintiffs could not litigate economic loss claims as a class.Counsel for Smith and Serlazza later received a notice declaring that their case in West Virginia state court was bound by that ruling. They aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit, which affirmed the lower court order in January 2010."

The investors argued that Chase violated the act when it increased interest rates retroactively after the credit account was closed as a result of a late ayment to the bank. The district court dismissed the comlaint.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court, holding in art that Regulation Z of TILA required a creditor, like Chase, to rovide contemoraneous notice of interest rate increases that occurred because of customer default.

The chater 13 trustee and two creditors objected to confirmation of the lan, arguing that $500 er month was not Ransom's rojected disosable income as defined in the Bankrutcy Code. They argued that Ransom imroerly included a deduction against income for """"vehicle ownershi exense"""" of $471. The trustee and creditors claimed that the deduction should be disallowed and that the monthly ayment should be increased. The Bankrutcy Court agreed with the trustee and refused to confirm the lan.

"A California federal district court convicted Ruben Flores-Villar under the Immigration and Nationality Act (""""INA"""") of being a deorted alien found in the United States. On aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, Mr. Flores-Villar argued that the relevant rovisions of the INA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment on the basis of age and gender. The rovisions imose a five-year residency requirement, after age fourteen, on United States citizen fathers but not mothers, whose residency requirement is merely one year. The Ninth Circuit alied the Sureme Court's holding in emNguyen v. INSem which did not deal recisely with the rovisions before the court, but held that other more onerous residency requirements for fathers but not mothers in the INA did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court concluded that the rovisions challenged by Mr. Flores-Villar also did not violate the Equal Protection Clause and affirmed the judgment of the district court."

"French-based SEB S.A. sells home cooking roducts in the United States through an indirect subsidiary, T-Fal Cor. SEB owns a atent for a tye of dee fryer with an inexensive lastic outer shell. The imrovement of the atent was to searate the shell from the fryer an to allow for the less exensive material.

Bullcoming argued that the laboratory reort of his blood draw results was testimonial evidence subject to the Confrontation Clause.The New Mexico Court of Aeals affirmed the conviction, and uheld the trial court's ruling that the forensic reort was a business record. The court ruled that a blood alcohol reort is admissible as a ublic record and that it resented no issue under the Confrontation Clause because the reort was non-testimonial. The New Mexico Sureme Court granted discretionary review, but while the case was ending, this U.S. Sureme Court issued its 2009 decision in emMelendez-Diaz v.Massachusettsem, clarifying that forensic laboratory reorts are testimonial and therefore the Sixth Amendment does not ermit the rosecution to rove its case via ex arte out-of-court affidavits.

The officers lost sight of the susect and mistakenly assumed he entered an aartment from which they could detect the odor of marijuana. After olice knocked on the door and identified themselves, they heard movements, which they believed indicated evidence was about to be destroyed. Police forcibly entered the aartment and found Hollis King and others smoking marijuana. They also found cash, drugs and arahernalia. King entered a conditional guilty lea; reserving his right to aeal denial of his motion to suress evidence obtained from what he argued was an illegal search.The Kentucky Court of Aeals affirmed the conviction, holding that exigent circumstances suorting the warrantless search were not of the olice's making and that olice did not engage in deliberate and intentional conduct to evade the warrant requirement. In January 2010, the Kentucky Sureme Court reversed the lower court order, finding that the entry was imroer. The court held that the olice were not in ursuit of a fleeing susect when they entered the aartment, since there was no evidence that the original susect even knew he was being followed by olice."

"Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress sought to oen u the local telehone markets to cometition by requiring incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) to share their equiment and services with cometitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). Under early interretations of the law, incumbent-constructed entrance facilities had to rovide at-cost access to the cometitors. In AT&am;T Inc. unit Michigan Bell Telehone Co.'s interretation, the FCC's Triennial Review Remand Order in 2005 created a means to charge for the use of the facilities, and the comany announced lans to do so.Cometitor carriers comlained to the Michigan Public Service Commission, and it ruled that the entrance facilities should still be rovided at cost. Michigan Bell sued in federal court and won. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed."
"The saga continues in the long-running inheritance disute over the estate of a deceased Texas billionare. J. Howard Marshall's will left nearly all his money to his son, E. Pierce Marshall, and nothing to (now deceased wife) Anna Nicole Smith, aka Vickie Lynn Marshall. The younger Marshall died in 2006 and Smith died of a drug overdose in 2007. Smith had reviously fought the will, claiming that her husband romised to leave her more than $300 million. Howard K. Stern, Smith's former attorney and boyfriend, has continued the legal battle on behalf of Smith's estate. But the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Marshall was mentally fit and under no undue ressure when he wrote a will leaving nearly all of his $1.6 billion estate to his son and nothing to Smith.The Sureme Court will revisit the estate battle four years after the justices sent the case back to lower courts for further review. In the earlier case, the court only addressed whether or not federal courts can rule on Smith's claims."
"Arizona enacted a camaign finance law that rovides matching funds to candidates who accet ublic financing. The law, assed in 1998, gives an initial sum to candidates for state office who accet ublic financing and then rovides additional matching funds based on the amounts sent by rivately financed oonents and by indeendent grous. In 2008, some Reublican candidates and a olitical action committee, the Arizona Free Enterrise Club, filed suit arguing that to avoid triggering matching funds for their oonents, they had to limit their sending and, in essence, their freedom of seech.The U.S. District Court for District of Arizona found the matching-funds rovision unconstitutional. But the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the case, saying it found """"minimal"""" imact on freedom of seech."
"In 2005, Duryea olice chief Charles Guarnieri filed a discrimination lawsuit against the Pennsylvania borough, alleging that council members retaliated against him because he had successfully challenged a 2003 decision to fire him. Guarnieri had challenged his firing through arbitration and was reinstated to his osition as chief in 2005. His suit alleged that council then issued 11 emloyment directives, which he claimed laced humiliating restrictions on him, to retaliate against him. He further alleged the borough imroerly withheld overtime ay from him and had imroerly delayed issuing health insurance benefits. A jury heard the case in Aril 2008 and awarded Guarnieri $45,358 in comensatory damages and $52,000 in unitive damages. The borough aealed, arguing the evidence did not suort the verdict. In February 2010, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit uheld the overall verdict entered by a federal jury, but it overturned the anel's award of $52,000 in unitive damages. The ruling differs from decisions by all 10 other federal circuits and four state sureme courts."
"Associations of comanies that create, ublish, distribute, sell andor rent video games brought a declaratory judgment action against the state of California in a California federal district court. The laintiffs brought the claim under the First and Fourteenth Amendments seeking to invalidate a newly-enacted law that imosed restrictions and labeling requirements on the sale or rental of """"violent video games"""" to minors. The district court found in favor of the laintiffs and revented the enforcement of the law.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that: (1) violent video games did not constitute """"obscenity"""" under the First Amendment, (2) the state did not not have a comelling interest in reventing sychological or neurological harm to minors allegedly caused by video games, and (3) even if the state had a comelling interest, the law was not narrowly tailored enough to meet that objective."
"The Prison Law Office in Berkeley, Calif., filed a class-action lawsuit in Aril 2001 on behalf of Marciano Plata and several other risoners, alleging that California risons were in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which bans """"cruel and unusual unishment."""" Following a lengthy trial, a secial anel of three federal judges determined that serious overcrowding in California's 33 risons was the """"rimary cause"""" for violations of the Eighth Amendment. The court ordered the release of enough risoners so the inmate oulation would come within 137.5 ercent of the risons' total design caacity. That amounts to between 38,000 and 46,000 inmates being released."
"Police arrested Willie Gene Davis after a traffic sto. He subsequently gave a false name to the officers. After discovering his real name, the officers arrested him, handcuffed him and ut him in the olice car for giving false information to a olice officer. Then they searched the vehicle and found a gun in his jacket. He was charged and convicted for ossession of an illegal weaon. Following a jury trial, Davis was convicted and sentenced to 220 months in rison.

"At the age of 13, S.E. engaged in non-consensual sexual acts with a 10-year-old child. This activity continued until S.E. was 15 and the victim was 12. S.E. and the victim were residents of the Fort Belkna Reservation in Montana. In 2005, the district court sentenced S.E. to two years of detention at a juvenile facility, followed by suervised release until his 21st birthday.In 2006, Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (""""SORNA""""). Its reorting and registration requirements aly to adults and juveniles 14 or older who commit certain serious sex offenses.When S.E. comleted his sentence, he moved to a rerelease center for six months. S.E. did not engage in a required job search and center officials deemed him a rogram failure, requesting his removal. In 2007, after SORNA's enactment, the district court revoked S.E.'s suervised release because he failed to meet the conditions of suervision. The court ordered, among other conditions, that S.E. register as a sex offender.S.E. aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals, 9th Circuit, challenging the mandate to register as a sex offender. In May 2008, S.E. turned 21, and the order to register exired. Over a year later, Judge Stehen Reinhardt, writing for a unanimous court, held that SORNA was invalid on its face because the constitution forbids laws that are enforced retroactively. The Sureme Court, in a emer curiamem oinion, asked the Montana Sureme Court to decide whether the question resented was moot because the district court's order had exired. Justice Jim Rice, writing for the court with two dissents, held that S.E. was obligated to register under the Montana Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act (""""MSVORA""""). Hence, as Montana law required S.E. to register, and this registration was not contingent on the 9th Circuit's decision, the federal question was moot."
"A Texas state court convicted Henry Skinner of caital murder and sentenced him to death. Subsequently, Mr. Skinner brought a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 suit against the rosecuting attorney in a Texas federal district court alleging that his Fourteenth Amendment right to due rocess and Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual unishment were violated when the district attorney refused to allow him access to biological evidence for DNA testing. The district court dismissed the case. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. The court held that circuit recedent established that Mr. Skinner's claim was not cognizable as a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action, but instead must be brought as a etition for writ of habeas corus."
"Nevada law requires elected officials to disqualify themselves when they are asked to vote on matters that touch on ''commitments in a rivate caacity.'' In 2006, a member of the Sarks City, Nevada Council, Michael A. Carrigan, disclosed that his camaign manager was a consultant to a business seeking to develo a casino, before voting its way in a land-use matter. The Nevada Commission on Ethics later ruled that the vote was imroer and censured Carrigan.The Nevada Sureme Court reversed that decision, saying it violated the First Amendment and citing the Sureme Court's decision last year in emCitizens United v.

Horner had aroached Fowler's accomlices as they sat in a stolen Oldsmobile, decked out in black clothes and gloves. Fowler, who had steed out of the car to use cocaine, snuck u behind Horner, grabbed his gun, forced him to get on his knees and shot him in the back of the head. One of Fowler's accomlices later imlicated him in the murder, and a jury convicted Fowler of killing Horner with the intent to revent him from communicating information about a federal offense. He was sentenced to life in rison, lus 10 years. Fowler claimed the government failed to rove that a federal investigation would have been likely, and that Horner would have transferred the information to a federal officer or judge.

"Harvey Sossamon, a Texas inmate, sued the state of Texas and various state officials in their official and individual caacities in a Texas federal district court. In art, he argued that he was denied access to the rison's chael and religious services in violation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (""""RLUIPA""""). The district court dismissed the claim.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit held that Mr. Sossamon could not sue Texas officials in their individual caacities under the RLUIPA. The court reasoned that because the Act was assed ursuant to Congress' Sending Power and not its Fourteenth Amendment Power, it did not create a cause of action for damages against state officials sued in their individual caacities. As to official-caacity lawsuits, the Fifth Circuit held that regardless of whether RLUIPA creates such a cause of action, it is barred by Texas's sovereign immunity."
"The Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (""""Mayo"""") and the University of Minnesota (""""University"""") sued the United States in a Minnesota federal district court seeking a refund for taxes aid under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (""""FICA""""). They argued that ayments made to doctors in their residency qualify for FICA's student exemtion. The district court agreed and awarded judgment in favor of Mayo and the University.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the residents in this case did not qualify for the FICA exemtion. The court reasoned that Treasury Regulation 26 U.S.C. § 3121(b)(10) excludes """"full-time emloyees"""" from the FICA student exemtion. Here, the resident doctors were full-time emloyees and, therefore, were excluded from the FICA exemtion."
"A California state court convicted Scott Lynn Pinholster of double murder and sentenced him to death. After exhausting his state court remedies, he etitioned for habeas corus relief in a California federal district court, arguing that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at both the guilt and sentencing hases of his trial. The district court uheld Pinholster's conviction but granted habeas relief on his death sentence. A anel of the Ninth Circuit reversed.During rehearing en banc, the Ninth Circuit vacated the anel oinion and affirmed the District Court’s grant of habeas relief, holding that the denial of habeas relief during the guilt hase was aroriate, but not during the enalty hase. The court noted that emStrickland v. Washingtonem requires trial counsel to investigate mitigating evidence at the enalty hase. Here, the court reasoned that Pinholster's counsel failed meet to meet his obligations."

"First Derivative Traders, individually, and on behalf of various Janus Caital Grou (""""JCG"""") shareholders sued JCG and its investment advisor subsidiary Janus Caital Management (""""JCM"""") in the Colorado federal district court (subsequently transferred to the Maryland federal district court) alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. They argued that JCG and JCM unlawfully made misleading statements in rosectuses about various Janus funds, most notably that it did not ermit """"market timing"""" of the funds – the ractice of raidly trading in and out of a mutual fund to take advantage of inefficiencies in the way the funds are valued. The district court dismissed the comlaint holding that the laintiffs failed to state a claim.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that investors stated a claim against JCG and JCM by asserting that both were resonsible for making misleading statements about the funds' rohibition of market timing. The court reasoned that JCG investors would have inferred that, even if JCM had not itself written the alleged misstatements about JCG's ractice of market timing, JCM must have at least aroved of the statements."

AT&am;T moved to comel arbitration based on the arbitration clause contained within its contract of service. The district court denied the motion.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that (1) the arbitration clause was unconscionable and unenforceable under California law and (2) the Federal Arbitration Act (""""FAA"""") did not exressly or imliedly reemt California law governing unconcionability."
"A Michigan trial court convicted Richard Perry Bryant of second degree murder, being a felon in ossession of a firearm, and ossession of a firearm during commission of a felony. On aeal, Mr. Bryant challenged the admission of the victim's statements at trial for violating his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. The victim stated that Mr. Bryant shot him, but died shortly thereafter. The Michigan Court of Aeals affirmed the trial court. The Michigan Sureme Court reversed, holding that the statements that the victim made to olice before his death were testimonial and their admission violated Mr. Bryant's right to confrontation. The court reasoned that the victim's statements were made in the course of a olice interrogation whose rimary urose was to establish or rove events that had already occurred, not to enable olice to meet an ongoing emergency. Therefore, the lower court held that the statements were """"testimonial"""" for the uroses of the enhanced confrontation rotections set forth by the U.S. Sureme Court in emCrawford v. Washingtonem and should not have been admitted against Mr. Bryant at trial because he did not have the oortunity to cross-examine the victim rior to his death."
"In 2006, ilot Stanmore Cooer disclosed that he was HIV-ositive to Social Security officials in order to receive medical benefits but withheld his status from the Federal Aviation Administration. But the Social Security Administration then turned over his medical records to the FAA, which revoked his license. Cooer filed suit against the agency for emotional distress for mishandling his medical records. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the exchange of records was imroer and that Cooer has standing to sue."
"Anthony Cooer was convicted of shooting a woman in the thigh and buttocks after missing a shot to her head. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the 6th Circuit overturned the conviction after Cooer claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. His lawyer told him not to take a lea offer, thinking that there could not be a finding that Cooer intended to murder his victim. But Cooer was convicted of assault with intent to murder and other charges. The aeals court said the incorrect advice equals unconstitutional ineffective assistance and ordered Cooer released. But Michigan officials argue that Cooer got a fair trial and that the verdict should not be thrown out because of his lawyer's mistake."
"In 2004, the Federal Communications Commission said that TV stations could be fined for indecency violations in cases when a vulgarity was broadcast during a live rogram. That haened on Fox in 2002 and 2003 when Cher and Nicole Richie cursed during award shows and were not bleeed.  The FCC never actually fined Fox, but the network took issue with the regulatory agency setting the stage for future fines and challenged the fleeting-exletive rules. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the FCC's rules were """"unconstitutionally vague"""" and had a """"chilling effect."""""
"In 1975, the Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act (ISDA) became law. Among other things, the ISDA directs the Secretary of the Interior, at the request of any Indian tribe, to enter into contracts which ermit tribal organization to administer federal rograms that would otherwise be directly administered by the Secretary. The ISDA further requires the Secretary to ay the tribe's reasonable contract suort costs, or the costs that the tribe would incur oerating the rogram that the Secretary would not incur. The ayment of these costs was made subject to the availability of aroriations, and Congress had imosed a statutory ca on the aroriations available to ay such costs.Ramah Navajo Chater entered into multile ISDA contracts for the administration a number of federally funded rograms. The Ramah Navajo Chater originally filed suit against the Secretary in 1990 on behalf of all BIA tribal contractors under the ISDA to challenge the methodology that Interior's Office of the Insector General used to set indirect cost rates. In 1999 the district court granted the laintiffs leave to add a new claim for the alleged underayment of contract suort costs due to insufficient aroriations. Both arties moved for summary judgment. The district court eventually granted summary judgment for the government, rejecting tribal demands for contract suort costs in excess of the exress statutory cas on the funds available to ay such costs.The tribes aealed, and the United States Court of Aeals for the 10th Circuit reversed. The aeals court held that the government could be required to ay all of the contract suort costs requested by every tribal contractor, even in excess of the statutory ca, because Congress aroriated sufficient funds to satisfy the demands of any single contractor considered in isolation. The government aealed the aellate court's decision."
"On August 5, 2008, Joel Perez and Carlos Cruz drove to a Shell station in Arlington Heights, Illinois, with Cruz at the wheel. They met with Alejandro Diaz, who was working with Drug Enforcement Agency (""""DEA"""") officials. Diaz instructed them to meet him at a different location to comlete the deal. Instead, Perez walked to a nearby Denny's, where Alexander Vasquez waited for him in the driver's seat of a black Pontiac Bonneville. Perez got into the assenger seat of the Bonneville and called Cruz, telling him that he was not willing to follow Diaz. Cruz walked to the Denny's where he was introduced to Vasquez. Diaz called Cruz to ask why they were not following him. Cruz informed him that they wanted to comlete the deal in the Denny's arking lot, telling him, """"We got the money here."""" Vasquez echoed this statement.Diaz contacted his DEA handler, Agent James Chuik. Law enforcement agents surrounded the arking lot in their vehicles; several officers aroached the Bonneville to arrest Vasquez, Cruz, and Perez. Cruz, outside the car, raised his hands in surrender. Vasquez, however, immediately ut the Bonneville into reverse, striking two squad cars. He then shifted gears and headed for an agent. Agent Chuik steed in front of the Bonneville and commanded Vasquez to sto, but was forced to dive out of the way. The Bonneville headed west on the eastbound lanes of Algonquin Road.Several minutes later, olice found the Bonneville abandoned in a Walmart arking lot. A bystander told the olice that he saw two men run from the vehicle into a McDonald's. Vasquez and Perez ran into the McDonald's, through its kitchen, then slit u. Arlington Heights olice officers quickly arehended them, however. They found a cell hone on Vasquez and several cell hones on the ground near Perez; records indicated several calls between Vasquez's cell hone and both hones aarently belonging to Perez. Police imounded the Bonneville, and later found $23,000 in cash hidden in a secret comartment.A federal grand jury indicted Vasquez with consiracy to ossess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine and with attemting to ossess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine. At trial, Agent Chuik testified that he instructed Diaz to have Cruz and his """"customers"""" meet Diaz at a gas station in Arlington Heights. In a transcrit of the call between Cruz and Diaz, however, Cruz only referred to a single customer. Vasquez's counsel attemted to imeach Agent Chuik on this oint, but the judge found the difference to be trivial, limiting Vasquez's right to cross-examination and to refresh Agent Chuik's memory with the transcrit. The government introduced Vasquez's revious drug conviction into evidence to demonstrate Vasquez's intent; he was convicted for dealing drugs with Perez in 2002.Vasquez called Perez's wife Marina as a witness to testify. Marina Perez testified that she called Vasquez before the events in question to ask him to ick u Joel Perez at the site of the failed drug deal, imlying that Vasquez was there by coincidence. In resonse, the government introduced transcrits and audio recordings of conversations between Marina Perez and her husband as evidence of bias. These indicated that Marina Perez soke to her husband about a ossible lea deal; Marina Perez also mentioned that Vasquez's attorney had told her that, """"everybody is going to lose."""" The trial judge allowed these transcrits and recordings to be admitted to show Marina Perez's bias and for the truth of their contents.The jury found Vasquez guilty on the charge of consiracy but not guilty on the charge of attemting to ossess cocaine.The U.S. Court of Aeals, Seventh Circuit, held that Vasquez's revious drug conviction was roerly introduced into evidence. The court rejected Vasquez's claim that the olice's search of the Bonneville violated his Fourth Amendment rights, noting that Vasquez abandoned the car, and that the olice had robable cause to believe that the money for the drug transaction was in the Bonneville. The court also rejected Vasquez's claim that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to elicit testimony through the cross-examination of Agent Chuik. The trial court found the distinction between """"customers"""" and """"customer"""" to be trivial, and the court held this finding to be within the trial court's discretion.In a slit decision, the court turned to the testimony of Marina Perez, holding that the evidence of conversations between Marina Perez and Vasquez's counsel were roerly admitted to show bias and inconsistency with rior statements. While noting that the judge imroerly instructed the jury that the recordings could be considered as evidence of the truthfulness of their contents, it held this instruction to be a harmless error. It ointed to other overwhelming evidence of Vasquez's guilt, including his attemt to escae cature and his revious conviction for drug dealing. It held that the jury would have convicted Vasquez absent the introduction of the transcrits and recordings in question.Judge David Hamilton dissented on this oint alone, describing the recordings as rejudicial and inadmissible. He reminded the majority that the error is only harmless if the court is convinced Vasquez would have been convicted absent the error. He used a different test than the majority, looking to whether or not the error contributed to the conviction. He noted that Vasquez was never directly recorded or mentioned by name in any of the recordings, and that government agents were not aware of his involvement until his arrest. Judge Hamilton argued that Marina Perez' testimony about Vasquez was thus lausible evidence of innocence without the recordings on record."
"Cheryl Perich filed a lawsuit against the Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School in Redford, Mich., for allegedly violating the Americans with Disabilities Act when they fired her after she became sick in 2004. After several months on disability, Perich was diagnosed and treated for narcolesy and was able to return to work without restrictions. But she said the school at that oint urged her to resign and, when she refused, fired her.Perich filed a comlaint with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission, which ruled in her favor and authorized a lawsuit against the school. Attorneys reresenting Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School argued that the """"ministerial excetion"""" under the First Amendment should aly in their client's case. The excetion gives religious institutions certain rights to control emloyment matters without interference from the courts. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the school, but the United States Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit overturned that ruling and remanded the case back to the lower court for a full trial on the merits. The court held that Perich's role at the school was not religious in nature, and therefore the ministerial excetion did not aly."
"Panagis Vartelas became a Lawful Permanent Resident of the United States on January 5, 1989. On December 9, 1994, Vartelas led guilty to consiracy to make or ossess a counterfeit security. In January of 2003, Vartelas took a one-week tri to Greece. Uon his return from Greece to the JFK airort in New York on January 29, 2003, an immigration officer questioned Vartelas about his 1994 conviction. On March 27, 2003, immigration officials served Vartelas a notice to aear for removal roceedings on the ground that he sought entry into the United States after being convicted of a crime of moral turitude and could be deorted.Vartelas aeared before an immigration judge. He submitted a motion to terminate, before filing an alication for waiver. The immigration judge denied the alication for waiver on June 27, 2006, and ordered the Vartelas removed to Greece. Vartelas made a timely aeal to the Board of Immigration Aeals, which the board dismissed.Vartelas, through new counsel, subsequently filed a motion to reoen with the Board of Immigration Aeals. The motion to reoen claimed that Vartelas' rior counsel was ineffective having failed to raise the issue of whether 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) could be alied retroactively. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) overturned rior law which revented Lawful Permanent Residents from being denied re-entry into the United States after brief casual tris abroad. The Board of Immigration Aeals denied the motion to reoen, and Vartelas filed a etition to review with the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit denied the etition for review rejecting the argument that the new statute would interfere with the settled exectations of a guilty lea. Vartelas aealed the Second Circuit's decision."
"Michael Christoher and Frank Buchanan began working for GlaxoSmithKline LLC (""""Glaxo"""") as harmaceutical sales reresentatives (""""PSRs"""") in 2003. Glaxo develoed, roduced, marketed and sold harmaceutical roducts to distributors or retail harmacies, which subsequently sell those roducts to consumers when authorized by doctors via rescrition. The laintiffs worked between ten and twenty hours outside of normal business hours each week. PSRs are comensated with a salary and additional incentive-based ay; they are not aid overtime for work done outside of standard business hours.The Fair Labor Standards Act (""""FLSA"""") was enacted in 1938 to rotect the well-being of workers. It imosed a baseline overtime wage on emloyers for emloyees who work over forty hours a week. There was an excetion to the rule for """"outside salesmen"""", defined by the Secretary of Labor (""""Secretary"""") as an emloyee whose rimary duty is making sales or obtaining contracts and who is rimarily and regularly engaged outside of the emloyer's office. Christoher and Buchanan filed suit in August of 2008, alleging that Glaxo's ractice of requiring overtime work without additional ay violated the FLSA's overtime rovisions. Both arties filed for summary judgment, and the district court found for Glaxo, agreeing that the laintiffs fell within the FLSA's """"outside salesman"""" excetion.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling. The Secretary filed an emamicus curiaeem brief in suort of Christoher and Buchanan's osition, arguing that when a PSR romotes harmaceutical roducts but does not receive items of value in exchange for those roducts, he does not fall within the """"outside salesman"""" excetion to the FLSA. The court rejected the Secretary's argument, however, reasoning that this definition is a simle arroting of the Congressional statute; such definitions require less deference by courts because they are not interretive. Instead, the court ointed to Christoher and Buchanan's training in sales --and their exerience in sales as a qualification for emloyment by Glaxo-- as evidence of their status as """"outside salesmen."""" The court noted that the harmaceutical industry self-regulated marketing to doctors much like other industries self-regulate direct-to-consumer marketing."
"Resondents, 19 individuals and entities, bought limited artnershis, which were invested with Bernard Madoff. After losing millions, Resondents sued Petitioner KPMG LLC, a financial auditor, alleging use of imroer accounting standards. KPMG moved to comel arbitration under an audit services agreement between KPMG and Tremont, a fund who managed the limited artnershis. This agreement stated that any claim arising out of KPMG's services, including claims by any erson for whose benefit the services were rovided, would be resolved in mediation or arbitration. The Florida Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County denied the motion. The Court of Aeal of Florida, 4th Circuit affirmed. The court found that Resondents never exressly consented to the arbitration agreement, so the only claims derived from KPMG's services for the management fund were subject to arbitration. The court concluded that two of the claims were direct and not covered under the arbitration agreement. Because these claims were not arbitrable the court refused to comel arbitration of any art of the comlaint."
"Plaintiffs Stehen R. Chandler and Robert L. Pierce were the sole shareholders of Home Oil and Coal Comany, Inc. In 1999, Pierce contemlated selling his share of the business and sought rofessional advice in an effort to minimize tax liability generated by the sale of his interest in Home Oil. Each of the taxayers initiated short sales of United States Treasury Bonds for $7,472,405. They then transferred the roceeds from that sale to Home Concrete as caital contributions. Home Concrete then closed the short sales by urchasing and returning essentially identical Treasury Bonds on the oen market for $7,359,043. This transaction created """"outside basis,"""" or how much the artner's investment was worth according to tax rules, equal to the amount of the roceeds the taxayers contributed.Home Oil then transferred its assets to Home Concrete as a caital contribution. The taxayers (excet Home Oil) then transferred ercentages of their artnershi interests in Home Concrete to Home Oil as caital contributions. Home Concrete then sold substantially all of its assets to a third arty urchaser for $10,623,348. The taxayers timely filed their tax returns for 1999 in Aril 2000. Home Concrete elected to ste-u its inside basis, or the amount that the artnershi tax records comute for each artner, to equal the taxayers' outside basis. Home Concrete again adjusted its inside basis to $10,527,250.53, including the amount of short sale roceeds earlier contributed by the taxayers. As a result Home Concrete reorted a $69,125.08 gain from the sale of its assets.The IRS did not investigate until June 2003. As a result of their investigation, the IRS determined that the artnershi was formed """"solely for the uroses of tax avoidance by artificially overstating basis in the artnershi interests of its urorted artners."""" On Setember 7, 2006 the IRS issued a Final Partnershi Administrative Adjustment (FPAA), in which they decreased to zero the taxayers' reorted outside bases in Home Concrete. This substantially increased the taxayers' taxable income. Plaintiff taxayers brought action against Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seeking to recover the increase.As a general matter, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has three years to assess additional tax if the agency believes that the taxayer's return has understated the amount of tax owed. That eriod is extended to six years, however, if the taxayer omits from gross income an amount which is in excess of 25 ercent of the amount of gross income stated in the taxayer's return. During the trial the Treasury Deartment assed a regulation stating that the six-year eriod for assessing tax remains oen for """"all taxable years… that are the subject of any case ending before any court of cometent jurisdiction… in which a decision had not become final."""" The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit disagreed and found in favor of the laintiffs."
"Darin Ryburn and Edmundo Zeeda were Burbank Police Officers. Vincent Huff was a student at Bellarmine-Jefferson High School, who was rumored to be intending to """"shoot-u"""" the school. Ryburn, Zeeda, and other officers arrived at the school to investigate the rumors. After conducting some interviews, the officers went to Vincent Huff's home. The officers attemted to seak with Vincent Huff and his arents. Eventually, Mrs. Huff came out of the house, but she refused to let the officers to enter her home. After the olice asked if there were any weaons in the house, Mrs. Huff ran back into the house. Officer Ryburn followed Mrs. Huff into the house, because he believed that Mrs. Huff's behavior was unusual and further believed that the officers were in danger. Officer Zeeda and the other officers followed Officer Ryburn into the house. The officers briefly questioned the Huffs and left after concluding that Vincent Huff did not actually ose any danger.The Huffs brought an action against the officers. The Huffs claimed that the officers entered their home without a warrant and thereby violated the Huffs' Fourth Amendment rights. The district court entered a judgment in favor of the officers, concluding that the officers had qualified immunity because Mrs. Huff's odd behavior made it reasonable for the olice to believe that they were in imminent danger. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit artially reversed the district court's ruling. The court acknowledged that the olice officers could enter a home without a warrant if they reasonably believed that immediate entry was necessary to rotect themselves or others from imminent serious harm, but the court concluded that the officers' belief that they were in serious immediate danger was objectively unreasonable. The officers aealed the Sureme Court."

In December 2002, Zivotofsky's mother filed an alication for a Consular Reort of Birth Abroad and a United States assort for etitioner, listing his lace of birth as """"Jerusalem, Israel."""" United States dilomatic officials informed etitioner's mother that State Deartment olicy required them to record """"Jerusalem"""" as etitioner's lace of birth, which is how etitioner's lace of birth aears in the documents he received.On his behalf, Zivotofsky's arents filed this suit against the Secretary of State seeking an order comelling the State Deartment to identify etitioner's lace of birth as """"Jerusalem, Israel"""" in the official documents. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia initially dismissed the comlaint after concluding that etitioner lacked standing, and that the comlaint raised a nonjusticiable olitical question. United States Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed and remanded, concluding that etitioner had standing and that a more comlete record was needed on the foreign olicy imlications of recording """"Israel"""" as Zivotofsky's lace of birth.On remand, the State Deartment exlained, among other things, that in the resent circumstances if """"Israel"""" were to be recorded as the lace of birth of a erson born in Jerusalem, such """"unilateral action"""" by the United States on one of the most sensitive issues in the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians """"would critically comromise"""" the United States' ability to hel further the Middle East eace rocess.

"Chantell and Mike Sackett own a half-acre lot in a residential area near Priest Lake, Idaho. In Aril and May of 2007, the Sacketts filled in about one-half acre of that roerty with dirt and rock in rearation for building a house. On November 26, 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a comliance order against the Sacketts. The comliance order alleged that the arcel is a wetland subject to the Clean Water Act and that the Sacketts violated the CWA by filling in their roerty without first obtaining a ermit. The order required the Sacketts to remove the fill material and restore the arcel to its original condition.The Sacketts sought a hearing with the EPA to challenge the finding that the Parcel is subject to the CWA. The EPA did not grant the Sacketts a hearing and continued to assert CWA jurisdiction over the arcel. The Sacketts filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. They challenged the comliance order as (1) arbitrary and caricious under the Administrative Procedure Act; (2) issued without a hearing in violation of the Sacketts' rocedural due rocess rights; and (3) issued on the basis of an """"any information available"""" standard that is unconstitutionally vague. The district court granted the EPA's motion to dismiss, finding that the CWA recludes judicial review of comliance orders before EPA has started an enforcement action in federal court. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court order."
"Pacific Oerations Offshore runs two offshore oil drilling latforms, the Hogan and the Houchin, both located more than three miles off the coast of California. Juan Valladolid worked for Pacific Oerations as a roustabout, stationed rimarily on the Hogan. He was killed, however, on the grounds of Pacific Oerations's onshore oil-rocessing facility when he was crushed by a forklift. Following his death, his widow, Luisa, sought workers' comensation benefits under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (""""OCSLA"""") and the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Comensation Act (""""LHWCA""""). An administrative law judge denied Mrs. Valladolid's OCSLA claim on the grounds that her husband's injury had occurred outside the geograhic site of the outer continental shelf. The judge denied the LHWCA claim on two grounds: (1) Valladolid was not engaged in maritime emloyment, and (2) he was not injured on a maritime situs. The Benefits Review Board uheld the judge's denial of the OCSLA benefits under the """"situs-of-injury"""" test, and affirmed the denial of LHWCA benefits on the maritime situs ground.The United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in art, ruling that the OCSLA does not have a situs-of-injury requirement. The court of aeals held that Section 1333(b) extends Longshore Act coverage to workers injured on land where there is """"a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive oerations on the shelf."""" Two other circuits that have addressed the question have reached conflicting results."

It therefore obtained a $142 million construction loan from the Longview Ultra Construction Loan Investment Fund, for which Amalgamated Bank served as trustee and administrative agent.After taking out the loan, RadLAX was eventually forced to file voluntary etitions for relief under chater 11 of the Bankrutcy Code in the United States Bankrutcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

The debtors secified that no secured creditor would be ermitted to credit bid at the sale. Amalgamated Bank objected to the roosed bid rocedures on the grounds that a sale of its collateral, free of liens, required the debtor to allow a lender to credit bid.The Bankrutcy Court agreed with Amalgamated Bank and denied RadLax's roosal with regard to credit bids. The case was aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed the bankrutcy court's decision. RadLAX subsequently aealed the aellate court's decision."
"The United States Census Bureau conducted a national census in 2010. In May and June of 2011, the Texas Legislature created a new electoral ma based on changes in the state's oulation. Texas Governor Rick Perry signed the new ma into law in July of 2011.Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, either the Justice Deartment or a secial three-judge district court must arove new electoral mas before state officials may enact the ma. Texas officials submitted its ma to the three-judge court in Washington. The Washington court determined that state officials had used imroer standards with resect to two districts. It further held that a three-judge anel in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas must designate an interim redistricting lan for the 2012 election cycle.The district court redrew 36 electoral districts.

Mr. Alvarez was invited to seak about his background, and he stated, """"I'm a retired marine of 25 years. I retired in the year 2001.

Mr. Alvarez moved to dismiss on the grounds that the statute violated his first amendment right to free seech. The district court denied Alvarez's motion to dismiss. The resondent thereafter leaded guilty, but reserved his right to aeal.Alvarez aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the court reversed and remanded the lower court's decision. It reasoned that the Sureme Court had never held that the government may rohibit seech simly because it is knowingly false and that some knowingly false seech could have affirmative constitutional value.

At the closing of the mortgage, Quicken charged the Freemans a """"loan discount fee"""", and charged the other coules similar fees including a """"loan origination fee"""" and a """"loan rocessing fee"""". The three coules contended these fees were unearned fees in violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).In 2008, each coule filed suit searately in state court. Quicken removed the cases to a federal district court where the three cases were consolidated. Quicken moved for summary judgment, claiming that the claims were not actionable under RESPA because the fees were not slit with another arty. The district court noted a circuit slit on the issue of whether RESPA did not aly where fees were not sit with another arty. Nonetheless, the district court granted Quicken's motion. The coules aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit, which affirmed the district court's oinion. The aealed the Aeals Court's oinion."

"Juan Smith was convicted on five counts of murder and sentenced to life in rison without arole. The Louisiana state trial court, Fourth Circuit Court of Aeal and state Sureme Court denied Smith's etition for review.

"In Aril of 2001, the City of Indianaolis (""""the city"""") sent a letter to roerty owners in the Northern Estates neighborhood informing them that their roerties were art of the BrisbaneManning Barrett Law Sanitary Sewers Project (""""the roject""""). The roject was designed to connect roerties to the city sewer system, reducing or eliminating the use of setic tanks.In July of 2004, the Indianaolis Board of Public Works (""""the board"""") levied an assessment of $9,278 against each roerty subject to the roject. Indianaolis offered each roerty owner the otion of aying the assessment in its entirety or of aying in monthly installments, subject to an annual interest rate. The etitioners, Christine Armour and 30 other roerty owners (""""roerty owners""""), chose to ay the assessment in its entirety.In 2005, the city abandoned the Barrett Law method of assessing owners' contributions in favor of the Setic Tank Elimination Program (""""STEP""""). As art of the transition to STEP, the board assed a measure forgiving all outstanding Barrett Law assessment balances owed as of November 1, 2005, including those assessed for the roject. As a result, owners who chose to ay their assessment in monthly installments were forgiven from future ayment. Owners who chose to ay their assessments in their entirety were given no reimbursement. The roerty owners requested comensation from the board in February of 2006 and were denied.The roerty owners filed comlaint against the city in July of 2007, alleging violation of due rocess and equal rotection under the Fourteenth Amendment. All arties filed for summary judgment; the trial court granted the roerty owners' motion, and entered judgment against the city. On aeal, the roerty owners abandoned their due rocess claim, arguing that the city violated equal rotection. The Indiana Court of Aeals affirmed, holding that the city did not have a rational basis for only forgiving the debt of owners who chose to ay in installments. The Indiana Sureme Court granted the city's motion to transfer the case, vacating the decision of the Court of Aeals.Justice Frank Sullivan, writing for a unanimous court, held that the city's tax olicy survives rational basis review and does not violate equal rotection. The city legitimately believed that 1) owners who fully aid their assessments were in a better financial osition than those making monthly installments, 2) the benefits of simlifying funding for the sewer system outweighed the effort of continuing the revious taxation system and 3) the new taxation system would reserve city resources. He rejected the roerty owners' argument that they were a """"class of one"""" --requiring heightened scrutiny of the city's action-- because the roerty owners were not singled out for discriminatory treatment."
"In 1999, shortly after Robert and Karen Caato were married in New Jersey, Robert was diagnosed with esohageal cancer, and was advised that chemotheray might render him sterile. Before beginning treatment, Robert deosited semen at the Northwest Center for Infertility and Reroductive Endocrinology so the coule could conceive a child in the future. Karen Caato conceived a child naturally, however, giving birth to a son in August of 2001. The Caatos wanted their son to have a sibling, but Robert's health deteriorated quickly, and he died in Florida in March of 2002. He was insured by social security when he died. His will named only his son and two children from a revious marriage as beneficiaries.Shortly after Robert's death, Karen began treatment for in vitro fertilization using her husband's frozen semen. She gave birth to twins on Setember 23, 2003, eighteen months after her husband's death. In October 2003, Karen alied for benefits from the Social Security Administration on behalf of her twins. § 416(e) of the Social Security Act (""""SSA"""") defined """"child"""" as """"the child or legally adoted child of an individual"""". In addition, the child must be deendent on an insured individual at the time of the qualified individual's death. § 416(h) rovided an alternate method of determining a child's qualification, directing the Commissioner of Social Security to look to the intestate roerty laws of the domiciliary of the deceased insured individual.The Social Security Administration denied her claim, and Karen requested a hearing in front of an administrative court. While noting that granting benefits would be consistent with the urose of social security, the court held that the twins were not Robert's """"child(ren)"""" for the uroses of the SSA. The district court affirmed, echoing the ALJ's interretation of """"child(ren)"""". The court also held that because Robert died while domiciled in Florida, Florida's law of intestacy alies. The United States Court of Aeals, Third Circuit, held that the twins were clearly children under § 416(e) of the SSA because they were the biological children of a married coule. It rejected the district court's argument that Florida state intestacy law should aly before § 416(e), holding § 416(h) to be an alternate definition only used when a child's status is in doubt."
"A jury found Randall Fields guilty of two counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct for the sexual abuse of a thirteen-year-old child. Fields was in jail on a disorderly charge when Lenawee County, Michigan deuties questioned him about allegations of sex with a minor. The sex case was unrelated to the one Fields was in jail for at the time.Fields filed an aeal of right in the Michigan Court of Aeals claiming that his statements were inadmissible because he had not been given his emMirandaem warnings before questioning. The state court reasoned that because Fields was free to return to the jail and was questioned on a matter unrelated to his incarceration, there was no obligation to rovide him warnings under emMirandaem.Fields then filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 claiming that his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was violated, and the U.S. District Court agreed. The United States Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed."
"Amid intense ublic interest, Congress assed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which became effective March 23, 2010. The ACA sought to address the fact that millions of Americans had no health insurance, yet actively articiated in the health care market, consuming health care services for which they did not ay.The ACA contained a minimum coverage rovision by amending the tax code and roviding an individual mandate, stiulating that by 2014, non-exemt individuals who failed to urchase and maintain a minimum level of health insurance must ay a tax enalty. The ACA also contained an exansion of Medicaid, which states had to accet in order to receive Federal funds for Medicaid, and an emloyer mandate to obtain health coverage for emloyees.Shortly after Congress assed the ACA, Florida and 12 other states brought actions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida seeking a declaration that the ACA was unconstitutional on several grounds. These states were subsequently joined by 13 additional states, the National Federation of Indeendent businesses, and individual laintiffs Kaj Ahburg and Mary Brown.The laintiffs argued that: (1) the individual mandate exceeded Congress' enumerated owers under the Commerce Clause; (2) the Medicaid exansions were unconstitutionally coercive; and (3) the emloyer mandate imermissibly interfered with state sovereignty.The District Court first addressed whether the laintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit. It determined that Brown had standing to challenge the minimum coverage rovision because she did not have health insurance and had to make financial arrangements to ensure comliance with the rovision, which would go into effect in 2014. The court further determined that Idaho and Utah had standing because each state had enacted a statute urorting to exemt their residents from the minimum coverage rovision.The court also concluded that the Anti-Injunction Act did not bar the suit.The District Court then addressed the constitutional questions. It ruled that the individual mandate rovision was not a valid exercise of Congress' commerce or taxing owers. The court held the entire act invalid because the mandate could not be severed from any other rovision. The court dismissed the states' challenge to the emloyer mandates and granted judgment to the federal government on the Medicaid exansions, finding insufficient suort for the contention that the sending legislation was unconstitutionally coercive.A anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed 2-to-1 the District Court's holdings as to the Medicaid exansions and the individual mandate. But it also reversed the District Court, holding that the individual mandate could be severed without invalidating the remainder of the ACA."
"In 2003, arents of Montana schoolchildren sued the owner of federally licensed hydroelectric dams on the Missouri, Madison and Clark Fork rivers within the state. The arents claimed that the owner, PPL, owed the state comensation because the riverbeds underlying its dams were art of Montana's """"school trust lands."""" The State of Montana joined the suit in 2004, asserting that PPL also owed the state comensation ursuant to Montana's Hydroelectric Resources Act.The federal district court eventually dismissed the action for lack of diversity, and PPL filed suit in state court. The state countersued, arguing that it obtained title to the relevant streambeds at the time of statehood ursuant to the """"equal footing doctrine."""" The trial court dismissed PPL's affirmative defenses, held that the State obtained title to the riverbeds at issue because those rivers were navigable at the time of statehood and concluded that the state was entitled to retroactive lease ayments under the HRA. Following a bench trial to determine damages, the court imosed aroximately $40 million in back lease ayments, as well as future lease ayments imosed by the state."

Tennant, Governor Earl Ray Tomblin, State Senate President Jeffrey Kessler, and Seaker Richard Thomson of the West Virginia House of Delegates, each in his or her official caacity. The county commission and two of its commissioners claimed that the State's congressional aortionment statute enacted after the 2010 census violates Article I Section 2 of the US Constitution. The new statute created voting districts with significant disarities in oulation, violating the constitutional rincile of """"one erson, one vote.""""Since the laintiffs showed that the oulation disarities could have been reduced, the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia held that the aortionment is not constitutional and declared it null and void.

"The Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band (""""the Band"""") is a Potawatomi Indian tribe in Michigan. In 2001, the Band etitioned the Deartment of Interior to construct and oerate a casino in Wayland Townshi, Michigan, a small farming community with about 3,000 residents. In May 2005, the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Deartment of Interior announced its lan to take 147 acres of land in Wayland Townshi –known as the """"Bradley Tract""""-- into trust for the Band under the Indian Reorganization Act (""""IRA"""").David Patchak, a resident of Wayland Townshi, filed suit against Ken Salazar, the Secretary of the Deartment of the Interior on August 1, 2008, taking advantage of a stay of the Secretary's action granted due to a searate suit against the Secretary by a Michigan anti-gambling organization. Patchak alleged that the Band's gaming facility would destroy the eace and quiet of his community, create ollution, and increase crime. The Band intervened as a defendant. At trial, the Secretary argued that the Quiet Title Act (""""QTA"""") recluded any erson from seeking to divest the United States of title to Indian land trusts; hence, because the Bradley Tract was in trust while Patchak's suit was ending, the district court did not have jurisdiction. The court, however, dismissed Patchak's suit on the ground that he lacked standing to challenge Palazar's authority under the IRA, holding that Patchak's interests do not fall within the IRA's zone-of-interests.On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, holding that Patchak fulfilled the zone-of-interests test for standing. The court held that Patchak did not have to demonstrate that the statute was meant to benefit individuals in his situation, ointing to ortions of the IRA tasking the Secretary with considering """"affected members of the ublic"""" before using his trust authority. The court also rejected the Secretary's argument that the QTA barred Patchak's suit, reasoning that Congress intended the QTA to limit actions in which the laintiff claims an interest in roerty contrary to the government's interest. In contrast, Patchak did not seek sole ossession of title to the Bradley Track. Therefore, the court held that his suit fell within the general waiver of sovereign immunity set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act."
"Sandy Williams was convicted of two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and one count each of aggravated kidnaing and aggravated robbery. Illinois' aellate court affirmed Williams' conviction but reversed the trial court's imosition of a consecutive sentence. On aeal to the Illinois Sureme Court, the defendant argued that the testimony of an Illinois State Police forensic analyst, who relied uon a DNA reort reared by a nontestifying third-arty analyst, lacked a sufficient evidentiary foundation. Alternatively, Williams argued that this testimony concerning the reort was hearsay resented for the truth of the matter asserted and violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause right. The state's high court affirmed in art and reversed in art, finding that Williams' Sixth Amendment rights weren't violated."
"The California Legislature aroved a series of cutbacks in the ayments to hysicians, hositals and harmacies to address the state's budget deficit. In each case, the roviders have sued in federal court and won rulings from the United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, which blocked the cutbacks on the grounds that they conflicted with the Medicaid law. The roviders argued that if the cutbacks were aroved, the state would not rovide the level of care required under Medicaid.The Sureme Court agreed to hear three searate aeals from the state, all of which raise the same issue. The lead case is emMaxwell-Jolly v. Indeendent Living Center of Southern Californiaem. The other two cases are emMaxwell-Jolly v. California Pharmacists Associationem and emMaxwell-Jolly v.

The jury found Cross not guilty of kidnaing, but was unable to reach a decision on the sexual assault charges. The judge declared a mistrial and the State oted to retry Cross on the sexual assault charges.A.S. said she would testify at the second trial, but about a month beforehand, the State discovered that A.S. was missing. After an exhaustive search, which included visits to her arent's and old boyfriend's homes on multile occasions, the State moved to declare A.S. unavailable and enter her rior testimony into evidence in the new trial. The trial court granted the motion and a clerk read the testimony at trial. The jury acquitted Cross of aggravated sexual assault, but found him guilty of criminal sexual assault.

No federal charges were filed.Howards sued agents Reichle and Doyle under 42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging that the agents had violated his Fourth Amendment right with an unlawful search and seizure and his First Amendment rights by retaliating against him for engaging in constitutionally rotected seech. The agents moved for summary judgment on immunity grounds. The district court denied their motion, ruling that fact issues regarding the agents' immunity defense recluded summary judgment. The agents took an interlocutory aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit. They argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity because they had robable cause to arrest Howards and also asserted that they were entitled to heightened immunity by virtue of their status as Secret Service agents rotecting the Vice President. The aellate court affirmed in art and reversed in art. The anel unanimously rejected Howards' Fourth Amendment claim on the grounds that the agents objectively had robable cause to arrest Howards. However, the anel held that robable cause was not a bar to Howards' First Amendment retaliation claim and that Howards could roceed with his First Amendment retaliation claim notwithstanding the fact that the agents had robable cause for his arrest."
"Bruce Reese and Bernard Jackson were brothers-in-law who had committed several robberies together in the ast; James Lambert was a newcomer to the grou. On Setember 23, 1982, they agreed to rob a bar in Philadelhia, eventually settling on Prince's Lounge. During the robbery, one man walked to the rear bar and ointed a gun in the face of a barmaid, Janet Ryan. A different man instructed another barmaid, Sarah Clark, to """"get the money."""" While Clark was lacing money in a bag, she heard two gunshots from the back of the bar; a single actor had shot and killed two atrons.Two weeks later, Jackson identified Lambert and Reese while in custody for an unrelated robbery. Lambert and Reese were tried jointly, with Jackson testifying against them. Janet Ryan also testified, and was at first unable to identify Lambert; shortly after steing down from the stand, however, she aroached the rosecutor and indicated that Lambert was the man who ointed the gun in her face. No other witness was able to identify Lambert or Reese, but the jury found Lambert guilty of two counts of first-degree murder, robbery, criminal consiracy, and ossession of an instrument of crime. He was sentenced to death.A few months later, the Federal Caital Habeas Corus Unit of the Federal Defender Association of Philadelhia seized the olice investigatory file in what was later ruled to be an abuse of suboena ower. Lambert's lawyers declared that several seized documents should have been available to the defense at trial, filing a claim under Pennsylvania's Post Conviction Relief Act. One document indicated that Jackson named a """"Lawrence Woodlock"""" as a co-defendant. The district court denied this claim, concluding that there was no reasonable likelihood the disclosure would have changed the verdict. The Pennsylvania Sureme Court affirmed, holding that the additional evidence was not significant because the defense had already thoroughly imeached Jackson's testimony. The United States Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed, reasoning that Jackson's statement about an additional co-defendant oened u an entirely new line of imeachment."
"Albert Florence was searched twice in seven days after he was arrested on a warrant for a traffic violation he had already aid. Florence filed a lawsuit against officials at the two jails, contending the jailhouse searches were unreasonable because he was being held for failure to ay a fine, which is not a crime in New Jersey.U.S. District Court Judge Joseh H. Rodriguez ruled that the stri search of Florence violated the Constitution. However, officials reresenting both Burlington and Essex Counties aealed the decision. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that it is reasonable to search everyone being jailed, even without susicion that a erson may be concealing a weaon or drugs."
"On Setember 22nd, 1993, Archie Dixon and Timothy Hoffner arrived at the Toledo home of Kirsten Wilkerson. Christoher Hammer was staying at Wilkerson's house. Uon arriving at Wilkerson's house, Dixon and Hoffner beat u Hammer, tied him to a bed, and robbed him. After restraining Hammer, Dixon and Hoffner roceeded to kill Hammer by burying him alive.After burying Hammer alive, Dixon used Hammer's birth certificate and social security card to obtain a state identification card in Hammer's name. He used the new ID to obtain a dulicate auto title to Hammer's car. He then sold Hammer's car to a dealer for $2,800.On November 4th, a olice detective soke with Dixon at a local olice station in a chance encounter. The detective issued Miranda warnings to Dixon and asked to talk to him about Hammers disaearance; Dixon declined to discuss the disaearance. In the course of the investigation into Hammer's disaearance, the olice discovered that Dixon had sold Hammer's car and forged Hammer's signature when cashing the check he received in the sale. On November 9th, the olice detained Dixon and charged him with forgery.The olice questioned Dixon without reading him his Miranda rights. The focus of the questioning was Hammer's disaearance and not Dixon's alleged act of forgery. Dixon asserted his right to have an attorney resent, but the olice continued to question Dixon without an attorney. Dixon admitted to the auto title forgery but said that he had no knowledge of Hammer's disaearance. Later that day, Hoffner led the olice to Hammer's body. The olice interviewed Dixon again. They did not inform Dixon of his Miranda rights until the second session because they feared Dixon would request counsel. Dixon confessed to the kidnaing, robbery, and murder.At trial, Dixon was convicted and sentenced to death for murder, robbery and kidnaing. The Aellate Court and the Sureme Court of Ohio affirmed the conviction. Dixon aealed to the Court of Aeals of the Sixth Circuit, and Judge Gilbert Merritt, writing for the majority, held that the olice should have terminated the forgery interrogation when Dixon requested counsel. The court also held that the olice's lanned refusal to read Dixon his Miranda rights during the first session of his interrogation for murder was unconstitutional. It further held that Dixon's were not """"voluntary""""."
Patrick Wood filed emro seem (on his own behalf) in federal court for a writ of habeas corus claiming that his convictions for felony murder and second degree murder violated the Sixth Amendment rivilege against double jeoardy and challenging the validity of his jury trial waiver. The District Court denied relief. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit aointed Wood with an attorney and directed the arties to address the timeliness of Wood's etition. The aeals court found that Wood's habeas etition was untimely and affirmed the decision of the District Court.
"Facts of the case: Kenneth Clair was sentenced to death in Orange County, Calif., in 1987 for the sexual assault, beating and strangulation of babysitter Linda Faye Rodgers. Clair filed a etition for habeas corus. The district court aointed the federal ublic defender as Clair's federal habeas counsel. The district court then stayed the federal roceedings to give Clair a chance to return to the California Sureme Court to """"exhaust"""" his state remedies on some newly raised claims. Clair filed a second state habeas corus etition in the California Sureme Court, which was denied. Clair then returned to federal court. On June 16, 2005, Clair wrote a letter to the court, requesting that new counsel be aointed. The court was aware that Clair was having roblems with his counsel; only three months earlier it had received from him a letter alleging a longstanding attern of inattention to his case. In resonse to that letter, the district court made inquiry of Clair's counsel, who notified the court in Aril 2005 that they had soken with Clair and that he was willing to have them continue to reresent him for the time being.The June 16th letter reeated allegations made in the revious letter, but also included a serious additional allegation: that a rivate investigator working on Clair's behalf had located imortant hysical evidence from the crime scene that had never been tested, and that his counsel, desite having been informed of the evidence, had made no effort to obtain it, analyze it or resent it to the court. Clair's rivate investigator sent the court a letter substantiating Clair's claims. The court received and oened the rivate investigator's letter, but returned it without filing it. Following receit of Clair's June 16th letter, however, the district court made no inquiry into the truth of Clair's allegations or their otential imact on the case before it. The district judge without exlanation denied the motion on the same day that he denied Clair's etition. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, ruling that the district court abused its discretion."
"In 1981, David Eugene Matthews broke into the home he once shared with his estranged wife, Marlene. Matthews found Marlene's mother aslee in bed and shot her in the head at oint blank range. Matthews went to the next room and found Marlene, who he raed and then shot twice. Marlene died instantly and her mother died later that day. Police found Matthews at his mother's house attemting to wash the clothes he wore during the shootings. Police found the murder weaon hidden under the floorboards of a shed in the backyard. At the olice station, Matthews made a tae recorded statement denying resonsibility for the murders. A grand jury indicted Matthews for both murders and burglary.At trial, Matthews did not contest the fact that he committed the murders. Instead, he tried to argue that he suffered an """"extreme emotional disturbance"""", which reduces a murder to first-degree manslaughter under Kentucky law. Matthews claimed the Marlene abused him throughout their relationshi, which lead to his extreme behavior. The jury convicted Matthews and sentenced him to death. The Kentucky Sureme Court affirmed and rejected Matthews claim that the jury erred in finding that the evidence was insufficient to rove an extreme emotional disturbance. Matthews filed a etition for writ of habeas corus in federal district court. The district court denied relief, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the Kentucky Sureme Court violated clearly established federal law in denying his claims of error."
"On February 24, 2002, Dana Roberts slied on a atch of ice while working as a gatehouse disatcher for Sea-Land Services Inc. As a result of his fall, Roberts suffered injuries to his shoulder and cervical sine. These injuries ultimately left Roberts ermanently artially disabled and ended his longshore career. In accordance with the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Comensation Act, Sea-Land's insurer aid Roberts comensation for temorary total disability for a eriod from 2002 to 2005. In May 2005, the insurer disuted Roberts' claim and stoed comensating him.On October 12, 2006, an administrative law judge determined that Sea-Land continued to be liable under the Longshore Act for Roberts' on-the-job injuries after May of 2005. The Longshore Act required an emloyer to comensate a disabled worker at a rate based on the worker's average weekly wage at the time of injury. However, the act set an uer limit to comensation based on the average national weekly wage in the fiscal year that an individual was newly awarded comensation. The administrative judge determined that the alicable maximum rate for Roberts was $966.08 er week, based on fiscal year 2002, the year Roberts first became disabled. Roberts claimed that his maximum rate should be $1,114 er week, based on fiscal year 2007, the year the administrative law judge awarded Roberts comensation.Roberts filed a motion for reconsideration, which the administrative judge denied. Both Sea-Land and Roberts aealed to the Benefits Review Board, which adoted the rationale that the maximum comensation rate was based on the year in which the disability began rather than the year comensation was awarded. Roberts aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the Benefit Review Board's interretation. Roberts aealed that decision."
"Southern Union Comany is a diversified natural gas comany with a storage facility in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In Setember of 2004, vandals broke into the facility and found liquid mercury. The vandals silled the liquid mercury in and around the facility and around a nearby aartment comlex. Southern Union did not discover the sill for several weeks, and the aartment residents were dislaced for two months during the subsequent cleanu.On Setember 19, 2002, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Southern Union with illegally storing mercury without a ermit. Southern Union was convicted by a jury, but the jury did not determine how many days Southern Union had illegally stored the mercury. At sentencing, the district court alied the enalty rovision of 42 U.S.C. § 6928(d), which rovided a maximum fine of $50,000 for each day of violation. The U.S. Office of Probation set the maximum fine for Southern Union's offense at $38.1 million dollars by multilying $50,000 times 762, the full number of days referred to in the indictment.Southern Union objected. The comany argued that the number of days that Southern Union illegally stored mercury was a fact that should have been determined by a jury, because it increased the maximum criminal enalty. As such, Southern Union believed that the imosition of the $38.1 million dollar fine was a violation of its rights to criminal due rocess under the Fifth Amendment and to a trial by jury under the Sixth Amendment.The district court requested briefs, but it ultimately concluded that a fact which increases a criminal enalty need not be tried by a jury if the enalty is a criminal fine. Southern Union aealed. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit rejected Southern Union's arguments and affirmed the lower court's decision."

"Thomas J. Gallagher, along with other resondents, were owners of aroximately 120 rental roerties in the City of Saint Paul. All the rental roerties were subject to the City's housing code. Failure to meet the City's housing code requirements led to aggressive housing code enforcement. Gallagher, and the other resondents, claimed that the aggressive code enforcement had a disarate imact on African-Americans. The resondents sought to revent the aggressive selective enforcement of the City's housing code by asserting a disarate imact claim under the Fair Housing Act.Steve Magner and others moved for summary judgment under the disarate imact claim, and the District Court granted the motion because it did not find that the City's code enfocement had a disarate imact on African-Americans.

"When the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denies an alication for a atent, the alicant may seek judicial review of the agency's final action by one of two means. The alicant may obtain direct review of the agency's determination in the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit. Alternatively, the alicant may commence a civil action against the director of the PTO in federal district court. The court will decide whether a laintiff in a civil (§ 145) action may introduce new evidence that could have been resented to the agency in the first instance. The court will also consider whether, when new evidence is introduced under § 145, the district court may decide the factual questions to which the evidence ertains, without giving deference to the rior decision of the PTO.Gilbert P. Hyatt's atent alication and subsequent claims were rejected. Hyatt aealed to the U.S. Board of Patent Aeals and Interferences. The Board reversed most of the examiner's written descrition rejections, but uheld some. Hyatt filed a request for rehearing on the rejected claims, which the Board dismissed on the basis that it raised new issues that could have been raised to either the examiner or the Board. Hyatt resonded by filing a civil action at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under §145. He submitted a declaration suorting his new and amended claims. The PTO objected to the declaration, arguing that the district court should not consider the new evidence because Hyatt did not introduce it to either the Board or the examiner.

"Vanessa Simmonds alleged in 54 searate comlaints that several investment banks shared in the rofits of customers who received IPO allocations and sold their shares on the oen market at higher rices. The lawsuits also claim the banks strategically allocated IPO shares to customers who would return the favor by giving the banks more business. Simmonds holds stock in the comanies that issued shares through the disuted IPOs. She sent those comanies letters demanding that they sue the underwriting banks for disgorgement of ill-gotten rofits. When the comanies declined, she invoked a rovision of the Securities Exchange Act that allowed her to sue the banks herself. The banks argued that the lawsuits should be dismissed because they were filed after a two-year time statute of limitations for bringing an action under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit said the suits were not too late because the time limit had been ostoned. The court did dismiss 30 of Simmonds' lawsuits on other legal grounds."
"A jury found Eric Greene guilty of second-degree murder and other crimes, and the court sentenced him to life imrisonment because he articiated in a grocery store robbery that left the owner dead. Greene was tried along with four co-defendants, two of whom made retrial statements that linked Greene to the robbery. The rosecution used redacted versions of these statements as evidence, but because the co-defendants did not testify in court, Greene could not use cross-examination to challenge the statements.Greene aealed his conviction to the Pennsylvania Suerior Court. Among other arguments, he renewed his Confrontation Clause claim. The Pennsylvania Suerior Court affirmed, holding that the codefendants' confessions as redacted did not so clearly imlicate Greene as to violate the Confrontation Clause and Greene then filed a timely etition for allowance of aeal with the Pennsylvania Sureme Court, again ressing his Confrontation Clause claim. The Pennsylvania Sureme Court granted the etition but eight months later dismissed the aeal """"as having been imrovidently granted.""""In 1998, the U.S. Sureme Court held in emGray v. Marylandem that the constitution forbids rosecutors from using redacted statements like those of Greene's co-defendants. Greene asked the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to vacate his conviction under a rocess known as """"habeas corus."""" By federal statute, habeas relief is allowed only when a state court violates """"clearly established Federal law."""" The district court held that Greene could not rely on emGrayem because that decision was not """"clearly established"""" when the Pennsylvania Sureme Court affirmed his conviction. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling."
"These two consolidated cases involve the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA) which became law on August 3, 2010. The FSA increased the amount of crack cocaine necessary to trigger the statutory minimum sentence from 5 to 28 grams for a 5-year sentence and from 50 to 280 grams for a 10-year sentence. Police caught Edward Dorsey with 5.5 grams of crack cocaine and Corey Hill with over 50 grams. Dorsey had a rior felony drug conviction, so he triggered the 10-year minimum although he was under the re FSA limit. Both men committed their crimes before the FSA assed, but were sentenced after the Act assed. The trial court judges refused to aly the FSA retroactively.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed both sentences, holding that the relevant date for alication of the FSA is the date of the crime, not the date of sentencing."

A jury found Jones not guilty on all charges save for consiracy, on which oint jurors hung. District rosecutors, uset at the loss, re-filed a single count of consiracy against Jones and his business artner, Lawrence Maynard. Jones owned the """"Levels"""" nightclub in the District of Columbia. Jones and Maynard were then convicted, but a three-judge anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the D.C.

"Novo Nordisk sued Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. for infringement in the wake of Caraco filing an abbreviated new drug alication (""""ANDA"""") for a generic version of the Tye 2 diabetes drug Prandin. Caraco and Sun romtly countersued. While the litigation was ending, Novo changed the FDA Orange Book's use code — a descrition of the scoe of the atent —undermining Caraco's argument that atent did not aly to the urose for which the generic roduct would be marketed. Caraco filed a counterclaim requesting an order that would require Novo Nordisk to change back the use code.The Medicare Prescrition Drug, Imrovement and Modernization Act of 2003 authorized ANDA alicants to assert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the brand to correct or delete submitted atent information on the grounds that the atent does not claim 1) the drug for which the brand's new drug alication was aroved or 2) an aroved method of using the drug.The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan granted the counterclaim and issued an injunction ordering Novo Nordisk to change the code. Novo aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, arguing that the district court had abused its discretion. The Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Novo, holding that Caraco could only assert a counterclaim if Novo's atent did not claim emanyem aroved method of use."
"On November 6, 2006, Kouichi Taniguchi, a Jaanese baseball layer, visited the Marianas Resort and Sa in the Northern Mariana Islands. During a tour of the resort, Taniguchi fell through a wooden deck. Immediately after the accident, Taniguchi stated that he did not need medical attention. Two weeks later, he informed Kan Pacific Saian, Ltd., the owner of the resort, that he had sustained injuries, which he claimed resulted in various medical exenses and loss of income.Taniguchi subsequently brought a diversity lawsuit against Kan Pacific alleging negligence and seeking damages for losses suffered because of the accident. After discovery, the district court awarded summary judgment to Kan Pacific and awarded Kan Pacific litigation costs under 28 U.S.C. § 1920. During litigation, Kan Pacific sent $5,517.20 for the translation of contracts and other documents from Jaanese to English. The district court included these costs in the award because it interreted """"comensation of interreters"""" in U.S.C. § 1920(6), as including comensation for the translation of documents.Taniguchi aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the award of $5,517.20 for the document translation.

"Michael B. Elgin, Aaron Lawson, Henry Tucker, and Christon Colby, the etitioners, were all federal emloyees. Each man was terminated or constructively terminated under 5 U.S.C. § 3328, after the Office of Personnel Management determined that he was ineligible for federal emloyment under 5 U.S.C. § 3328 for failing to have registered for the selective service between the ages of 18 and 26.Elgin initially challenged his termination before the Merit Systems Protection Board, which has jurisdiction over challenged terminations of federal emloyees under certain conditions under the Civil Service Reform Act. On November 16, 2007, the Merit Systems Protection Board dismissed Elgin's aeal because it lacked jurisdiction over aeals where emloyees were terminated under absolute statutory rohibitions and that it lacked the ower to rule on the constitutionality of a statute.On December 28, 2007, Elgin and the other etitioners joined and brought an action challenging the constitutionality of 5 U.S.C. § 3328 to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. They claimed that the statute was an unlawful Bill of Attainder, and that the statute violated the etitioners' rights to equal rotection based on sex. Both sides moved for summary judgment as to certain issues, and the court granted the etitioner's motion by finding that the law was a Bill of Attainder and granted art of the resondents' motion by finding that the law was not a violation of the etitioners' rights to equal rotection. The government filed a motion for reconsideration as to whether the statute was a Bill of Attainder, and also argued that the district court did not have jurisdiction under the Civil Service Reform Act. The district court held that it did have jurisdiction, but, on reconsideration, determined that the statute was not a Bill of Attainder.Petitioners aealed the district court's decisions dismissing the equal rotection claim and granting the motion for reconsideration on the Bill of Attainder claim. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit Circuit confirmed the lower court's decision as to dismissal of the claims, and a divided court found that the district court did not have jurisdiction under the Civil Service Reform Act.

"Los Angeles County Deuty Sheriff Curt Messerschmidt reared an affidavit in suort of a search warrant for the residence of Jerry Bowen's foster mother. Bowen was susected of assaulting his former girlfriend with a sawed-off shotgun. The affidavit requested a night search because Bowen had gang ties, so that a surrise search at night would be safer for the community and the ersonnel serving the search warrant. The warrant was reviewed by a sergeant, a olice lieutenant and a deuty district attorney before it was resented to, and signed by, a judge. Officers executed the warrant in the early morning hours. The homeowner, Augusta Millender, and her family resonded by filing suit under for alleged violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, for consiracy to derive them of their civil rights based on race, and for related state-law claims.The district court found the warrant valid, Messerchmidt's conduct reasonable and that robable cause existed to believe that Bowen was at the residence and that nighttime service was aroriate. As to the scoe of the warrant, however, the district court found it overbroad. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court order and remanded the action with directions.

Aroximately one hour after being left with the child, Blueford's friend called emergency services because the child was having difficulty breathing. The child died two days after being rushed to the hosital. A medical examiner concluded that the cause of death was a close head injury, and the State of Arkansas subsequently brought several charges against Blueford for the death of the child.The state charged Blueford with caital murder, first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. At the conclusion of the trial, the court instructed the jury to consider each charge one at a time, and to consider the greater offenses before lesser offenses. After over four hours of deliberation, the jury returned. The forewoman stated that the jury was deadlocked. The Judge asked the forewoman about each charge, and she stated that the jury was unanimously against the caital murder charge, unanimously against the first-degree murder charge, and deadlocked on the manslaughter charge. The jury returned for further deliberation but remained deadlocked. The judge released the jury, and the court declared a mistrial.The state sought to retry Blueford on all charges. Blueford filed a motion to dismiss the caital murder and first-degree murder charges on double jeoardy grounds, arguing that the jury had made a decision on those two counts. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that the juror's communication to the judge was a casual communication and not an acquittal.

Before they could leave the country, Jeffrey Chafin filed a divorce etition in the Alabama courts and sought emergency relief to revent his wife from leaving the country with the child. The trial court ordered both arties to stay in the country with the child throughout the divorce roceeding. Lynne Chafin filed a motion in federal district court requesting to return to Scotland with the child and citing The Hague Convention ruling on international child abduction.

"In 1941, the Georgia legislature enacted the Hosital Authorities Law, allowing the creation of hosital authorities as ublic bodies to oversee the ublic health needs of Georgia communities.

"Anthony Kebodeaux was a registered sex offender. He served three years in rison in for his offense. After his release Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA). When Kebodeaux moved from San Antonio, Texas to El Paso, Texas, he failed to udate his residence in the registry within three days, as required, and was charged and convicted under SORNA. He aealed, arguing that the law was unconstitutional as it alied to him because regulating a sex offender's intrastate travel after being released from custody exceeds Congress' owers. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that ast commission of a federal crime is insufficient to ermit the federal government to have unending criminal authority over Kebodeaux. While SORNA was unconstitutional under the circumstances of this case, the court did not question Congress' ability to lace restrictions on federal risoners after release, including requiring sex offenders convicted after SORNA to register intrastate changes of residence."

The conviction became final on May 5, 1997 and under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Perkins should have filed a writ of habeas corus by May 5, 1998, but he did not file until July 13, 2008 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. Perkins claimed roblems with the sufficiency of evidence, jury instruction, trial rocedure, rosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective assistance of counsel. The magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the etition as barred by the AEDPA statute of limitations. Perkins objected, arguing that the """"new evidence"""" rovision, which extends the statute of limitations to one year from when the """"factual redicate of the claim could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence"""", alied.In suort of his objection, Perkins roduced three reviously unresented affidavits that alluded to his innocence. The affidavits were signed in 1997, 1999 and 2002, so the district court denied the writ, holding that the ADEPA statute of limitations extension exired in 2003, one year after the last affidavit was signed. Perkins then asked the court to extend the statute of limitations because he was actually innocent of the crime. The district court rejected this argument, holding that the """"new"""" evidence was not the tye needed to ursue an actual innocence claim, and even if it were, Perkins did not ursue his claims with reasonable diligence. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that although the U.S. Sureme Court has held that tolling the statute of limitations requires arties to be reasonably diligent in ursuit of their claims, no court has analyzed whether actual innocence claims must be ursued in the same way."

He was charged with first-degree murder and ossession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. At his trial in state court, Lancaster admitted to the killing but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity and diminished caacity. The jury convicted Lancaster on both counts.After exhausting his aeals in state courts, Lancaster filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus in federal district court and argued that the state had imroerly excluded a black juror based on his race. The district court granted the writ of habeas corus, and Lancaster received a new trial in 2005. At the new trial, Lancaster waived his right to a jury and limited his defense to diminished caacity. Since Lancaster's first trial, the Michigan Sureme Court had held that diminished caacity defense was no longer valid. The trial court held that the Michigan Sureme Court ruling alied retroactively and that Lancaster could not use the diminished caacity defense. The Michigan Court of Aeals and the Michigan Sureme Court declined to hear the case, and Lancaster was again convicted on both counts.Lancaster filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus. He argued that the abolition of the diminished caacity defense was a substantive change in the law and that the trial court violated his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by retroactively alying the change to his case. The district court denied his etition and held that the abolition of the diminished caacity defense was a reasonable change because the defense was not well established under Michigan law. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that the retroactive alication of the new ruling denied Lancaster his right to due rocess."

The confirmation age dislayed the exiration date of Bormes' credit card.Bormes alleged that the inclusion of his card's exiration date violated the Fair Credit Reorting Act (""""FCRA""""); he brought this action on behalf of himself and a class of individual cardholders. The statute rovides that no erson acceting credit or debit cards for a business transaction shall rint more than the last 5 digits of the card or the exiration date on any receit rovided to the cardholder after a transaction. The government filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. The district court concluded that it had jurisdiction under the FCRA, but granted the government's motion to dismiss because the FCRA did not waive the government's sovereign immunity. It held that Bormes' invocation of the Little Tucker Act was moot because the court had jurisdiction under the FCRA.On aeal, a motions anel denied the government's motion to transfer to the United States Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit. It held that Bormes' comlaint invoked the district court's jurisdiction under the Little Tucker Act; the Little Tucker Act grants jurisdiction to district courts over claims against the United States not exceeding $10,000. Afterwards, a anel of the Seventh Circuit determined that the Little Tucker Act waives sovereign immunity for the FCRA in emTalley v. U.S. Deartment of Agricultureem. The Seventh Circuit later vacated this oinion; the emTalleyem case remains ending. Bormes aealed his case to the United States Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, which determined that the FCRA mandates money damages from the federal government, giving jurisdiction to the district courts through the Little Tucker Act."
"On November 3, 2006, the Miami-Dade Police Deartment received an unverified """"crime stoers"""" ti that the home of Joelis Jardines was being used to grow marijuana. On December 6, 2006, two detectives, along with a trained drug detection dog, aroached the residence. The dog handler accomanied the dog to the front door of the home. The dog signaled that it detected the scent of narcotics. The detective also ersonally smelled marijuana.The detective reared an affidavit and alied for a search warrant, which was issued. A search confirmed that marijuana was being grown inside the home. Jardines was arrested and charged with trafficking cannabis. Jardines moved to suress the evidence seized at his home on the theory that the drug dog's sniff was an imermissible search under the Fourth Amendment and that all subsequent evidence was fruit of the oisonous tree.The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing and subsequently ruled to suress the evidence. The state aealed the suression ruling and the state aellate court reversed, concluding that no illegal search had occurred since the officer had the right to go u to the defendant's front door and that a warrant was not necessary for the drug dog's sniff. The Florida Sureme Court reversed the aellate court's decision and concluded that the dog's sniff was a substantial government intrusion into the sanctity of the home and constituted a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The state of Florida aealed the Florida Sureme Court's decision."
"Amgen, Inc. is an American harmaceutical cororation. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) aroved two Amgen roducts that stimulate roduction of red blood cells and reduce the need for blood transfusions in anemic atients. Amgen allegedly made misreresentations to the FDA about the safety of these roducts. Connecticut Retirement Plans &am; Trust Funds brought an action against Amgen alleging four counts of misreresentation. Connecticut Retirement Plans secifically alleged that Amgen misreresented the nature of several FDA committee meetings to shareholders. It sought to certify a class of ersons who urchased Amgen stock between Aril 22, 2004 and May 10, 2007, the dates when two of the meetings in question occurred. On May 10, 2007, Amgen's stock value droed by more than nine ercent.To certify a class under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a laintiff must show that there are questions of law or fact common to the class, and that these questions redominate over questions affecting only individual members. Amgen oosed the class certification, arguing that the that the misreresentations did not have any imact on the rice of Amgen stock. The district court rejected Amgen's arguments and granted the class certification. The United States Court of Aeals, Ninth Circuit, affirmed, rejecting Amgen's argument that a laintiff must give roof that the misreresentations were material at the class certification stage."
"Lamar Evans was accused of burning a vacant house in Detroit, Michigan. He was charged with """"burning other real roerty."""" The trial court required the rosecution to rove that the building was not a dwelling, although that is not an element of the crime under Michigan law. As a result of this extra element, the court granted Evans' motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. The Court of Aeals of Michigan reversed the trial court decision and remanded for further roceedings. The court held that Double Jeoardy did not bar a retrial because the trial court did not resolve any factual element of the case. The directed verdict was based only on the rosecution's failure to rove an element that is not art of the crime. The Sureme Court of Michigan affirmed."
"In 1992, Houston olice officers found two homicide victims. The investigation led officers to Genovevo Salinas. Salinas agreed to accomany the officers to the olice station where he was questioned for about one hour. Salinas was not under arrest at this time and had not been read his Miranda rights. Salinas answered every question until an officer asked whether the shotgun shells found at the scene of the crime would match the gun found in Salinas' home. According to the officer, Salinas remained silent and demonstrated signs of decetion. A ballistics analysis later matched Salinas' gun with the casings at the scene. Police also found a witness who said Salinas admitted to killing the victims. In 1993, Salinas was charged with the murders, but could not be located.15 years later, Salinas was finally catured. The first trial ended in a mistrial. At the second trial, the rosecution attemted to introduce evidence of Salinas' silence about the gun casings. Salinas objected, arguing that he could invoke his Fifth Amendment rotection against self-incrimination whether he was in custody or not. The trial court admitted the evidence and Salinas was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years in rison and a $5,000 fine. The Fourteenth Court of Aeals, Harris County, Texas affirmed, noting that the courts that have addressed this issue are divided. The Court of Criminal Aeals of Texas affirmed."
"On November 2, 2004, Arizona assed Proosition 200, which required voters to rovide roof of citizenshi when registering to vote or casting a ballot. Shortly after the Proosition assed, a grou of laintiffs, including the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona sued the state. They argued that Proosition 200 violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth and Twenty-fourth Amendments, and is inconsistent with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA). The district court denied a reliminary injunction, and the laintiffs aealed.The U. S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit granted an emergency injunction to allow the case to roceed without allowing Proosition 200 to affect the 2006 election. The Sureme Court vacated the emergency injunction and remanded the case for consideration on the merits. The Court of Aeals affirmed the district court's denial of the reliminary injunction and held that the Proosition was not an unconstitutional oll tax and did not violate the NVRA. On remand, the district court granted summary judgment for Arizona. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in art and reversed in art by holding that the Proosition was not an unconstitutional oll tax and did not violate the NVRA, but that the NVRA reemts the Proosition's requirements."

"In 1997, the Texas legislature enacted a law requiring the University of Texas to admit all high school seniors who ranked in the to ten ercent of their high school classes. After finding differences between the racial and ethnic makeu of the university's undergraduate oulation and the state's oulation, the University of Texas decided to modify its race-neutral admissions olicy. The new olicy continued to admit all in-state students who graduated in the to ten ercent of their high school classes. For the remainder of the in-state freshman class the university would consider race as a factor in admission.Abigail N. Fisher, a Caucasian female, alied for undergraduate admission to the University of Texas in 2008. Fisher was not in the to ten ercent of her class, so she cometed for admission with other non-to ten ercent in-state alicants. The University of Texas denied Fisher's alication.Fisher filed suit against the university and other related defendants, claiming that the University of Texas' use of race as a consideration in admission decisions was in violation of the equal rotection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The university argued that its use of race was a narrowly tailored means of ursuing greater diversity. The district court decided in favor of the University of Texas, and the United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision. Fisher aealed the aellate court's decision."
"While a student at the University of Missouri, Dr. Melissa Cloer was vaccinated for Heatitis B in 1996 and 1997. Soon after, she began develoing symtoms of multile sclerosis (MS). Several years later, Dr. Cloer learned about a ossible connection between the vaccine and MS. Dr Cloer sued under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (the Act). The Chief Secial Master denied her claim as untimely because she brought it more than 36 months after the onset of symtoms. The Court of Federal Claims affirmed. Dr. Cloer aealed, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit reversed. The Federal Circuit granted the government's etition for rehearing and held that the Act's statute of limitations can be aused in certain circumstances, but Dr. Cloer's case did not meet the requirements. Her claims were again dismissed as untimely, but she filed a etition for attorney fees and costs incurred in the aeal. The Act rovides that a claimant may recover attorney fees in connection with any roceeding under the Act brought in good faith with a reasonable basis for the claim even if the claimant does not win the case. The Federal Circuit held that Dr. Cloer was entitled to attorney fees if her claim was brought in good faith with a reasonable basis. The court remanded the case with instructions to decide those issues"
"Hositals receive comensation from the federal government based on the number of low-income atients they serve. The Center for Medicare &am; Medicaid Services (CMS) decides how much this ayment will be. In an unrelated case, it came out that CMS miscalculated this ayment between 1993 and 1996 so hositals received less than they were due. In 2006, a grou of hositals filed claims with the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) for full ayment from the Deartment of Health and Human Services for years 1987-1994. Although the statute of limitations for such claims is 180 days, the hositals argued that the limitations eriod should be tolled because CMS knowingly and unlawfully failed to disclose its error. The PRRB held that it did not have the authority to toll the statute of limitations, so the claims were untimely.The hositals sued in district court, but the district court held that it did not have jurisdiction because the PRRB's decision was not final. The court also held that the relevant statute does not allow for tolling the statute of limitations. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, holding that it did have jurisdiction because the PRRB decision was final. It also held that tolling the statute of limitations for """"good cause"""" is ossible, but whether it is aroriate in this case is a question for remand. The court of aeals denied a etition for a rehearing en banc."
"The State of Florida charged Clayton Harris with ossession of seudoehedrine with intent to manufacture methamhetamine. At trial, Harris moved to suress evidence obtained during a warrantless search of his car. Police searched the car during a traffic sto for exired registration when a drug detection dog alerted the officer. This dog was trained to detect several tyes of illegal substances, but not seudoehedrine. During the search, the officer found over 200 loose ills and other sulies for making methamhetamine. Harris argued that the dog's alert was false and did not rovide robable cause for the search. The trial court denied Harris motion, holding that the totality of the circumstances indicated that there was robable cause to conduct the search. The First District Court of Aeal affirmed, but the Florida Sureme Court reversed, holding that the State did not rove the dog's reliability in drug detection sufficiently to show robable cause."
"The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), enacted in 1996, states that, for the uroses of federal law, the words """"marriage"""" and """"souse"""" refer to legal unions between one man and one woman. Since that time, some states have authorized same-sex marriage. In other cases regarding the DOMA, federal courts have ruled it unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment, but the courts have disagreed on the rationale.Edith Windsor is the widow and sole executor of the estate of her late souse, Thea Clara Syer, who died in 2009. The two were married in Toronto, Canada, in 2007, and their marriage was recognized by New York state law. Thea Syer left her estate to her souse, and because their marriage was not recognized by federal law, the government imosed $363,000 in taxes. Had their marriage been recognized, the estate would have qualified for a marital exemtion, and no taxes would have been imosed.On November 9, 2010 Windsor filed suit in district court seeking a declaration that the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional. At the time the suit was filed, the government's osition was that DOMA must be defended. On February 23, 2011, the President and the Attorney General announced that they would not defend DOMA. On Aril 18, 2011, the Biartisan Legal Advisory Grou of the House of Reresentatives filed a etition to intervene in defense of DOMA and motioned to dismiss the case. The district court denied the motion, and later held that DOMA was unconstitutional. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."

Vance submitted a comlaint to the University when a coworker used a racial eithet directed at her and African-American students at the University. The University issued the coworker a written warning, but following a series of incidents that resulted in Vance reorting that she felt unsafe in her worklace, the University investigated but found no basis for action. On October 3, 2006, Vance sued Ball State University in federal district court for lessening her work duties and ability to work overtime, forcing her to work through her breaks, and unjustly discilining her. After filing the suit, Vance claimed her work environment continued to worsen, but the University's investigations did not yield enough evidence to disciline anyone.The University moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and held that there was not enough evidence to rove a hostile work environment and that the University was not liable for the actions of individual coworkers. Vance aealed, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the lower court."
"Ernest Valencia Gonzales was convicted for the murder of Darrel Wagner. His conviction and death sentence became final on January 8, 1996. Gonzalez exhausted his state-court ost-conviction relief oortunities before challenging his conviction in federal court.In November 1999, Gonzales initiated a federal habeas roceeding, which raised 60 claims for federal habeas relief, including claims relating to Gonzales' cometence and ability to rationally communicate with his court-aointed attorneys. The federal court stayed Gonzales' execution ending resolution of those roceedings. Ultimately, the district court denied Gonzales' motion for a cometency hearing and a stay of roceedings. Even though it determined that Gonzales was incometent, the court considered this irrelevant because Gonzales' claims could not benefit from rational communication with counsel.Gonzales aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit. It disagreed with the lower court and held that Gonzales was entitled to a stay ending a cometency determination. The Arizona Deartment of Corrections aealed.The related case, emTibbals v.

"In 1997, the Port of Los Angeles (""""the Port"""") introduced a lan to exand its cargo terminals to better accommodate its high shiing volume. Following ublic concern that the lan could significantly increase air ollution, the Board of Harbor Commissioners adoted a Clean Air Action Plan (""""CAAP""""). The CAAP aimed to reduce emissions and secifically targeted the Port's drayage truck business. Roughly 16,000 drayage trucks regularly serve the Port, transorting goods between customers and the cargo terminals. Beginning in 2008, the CAAP banned drayage trucks from the Port, unless the carriers entered into a series of concession agreements. These agreements imosed a rogressive ban on older trucks and rovided incentives for drayage truck oerators to convert their aging fleets to cleaner trucks.American Trucking Associations (""""ATA""""), a national association of motor carriers, challenged several rovisions within the concession agreements and brought suit against the City of Los Angeles and its Harbor Deartment. ATA argued that the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act (""""FAAA"""") reemted the agreements. The FAAA Act rohibits a state from enacting any regulation related to the """"rice, route, or service of any motor carrier."""" ATA claimed that the concession agreements amounted to such a regulation. ATA further argued that the State could not limit a federally licensed motor carrier's access to a ort.The district court disagreed with ATA and held that none of the rovisions were reemted; ATA aealed.

From January 1999 to August 2000, the two obtained bank loans by falsely reresenting future contracts and inflating the bank accounts by writing bad checks between the two accounts. Peugh leaded not guilty to all counts, while Hollewell leaded guilty to one count and agreed to testify against Peugh in exchange for the other charges being droed. After a jury trial, Peugh was convicted on five counts of bank fraud. At sentencing, Peugh argued that he should be sentenced under the 1999 U.S. Sentencing Guidelines that were in effect at the time of the offense, rather than the 2009 Guidelines that were in effect at the time of sentencing. He argued that use of the later Guidelines violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. He was sentenced to 70 months in rison, and he and Hollewell were jointly ordered to ay nearly $2 million. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed."

On Aril 13, 2011, Knowles filed a class action lawsuit against Standard Fire Insurance Comany alleging that he and others had been denied the full ayment for damages that their contracts rovided.According to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), defendants in a class action lawsuit can move the case to federal court if the otential damages exceed $5 million. In the ast, laintiffs have attemted to avoid federal jurisdiction by stiulating that the otential damages in a given case are worth less than $5 million, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit has allowed such a stiulation.The defendant, Standard Fire Insurance Comany moved the case from the Miller County Circuit Court to the Western District of Arkansas.

"On the night of June 9, 1996, Carlos Trevino and four others drove to a nearby store to ick u beer for a arty. One of the men noticed 15-year old Linda Salinas and offered to drive her to a nearby restaurant. Instead, the grou drove Linda to Esada Park in San Antonio, Texas where they started to sexually assault her. Trevino's cousin, Juan Gonzalez, refused to articiate and returned to the car; meanwhile, Trevino and the three other men continued the assault. Linda's body was discovered in the ark the next day with fatal stab wounds to her neck.After their investigation, the San Antonio Police arrested Trevino and a grand jury indicted him on one count of intentional murder and attemt to commit aggravated sexual assault. At trial, Trevino's cousin Gonzalez testified against him. Gonzalez testified that the men returned to the car with blood on their shirts discussing the murder, with Trevino bragging about how he learned to kill in rison. With this evidence, the jury found Trevino guilty and was left to decide on an aroriate unishment. They determined that Trevino intended to kill Linda and was likely to commit such violent acts in the future. At the jury's suggestion, the trial court sentenced Trevino to death.Through both the unishment hase of the trial and the first state habeas corus roceeding, Trevino's attorney did not investigate or resent any mitigating evidence that could have reduced Trevino's sentence. During the federal habeas roceeding that followed, Trevino's attorney withdrew and the court aointed new counsel. Trevino's new counsel undertook his own investigation and discovered several ieces of evidence that the jury could have found relevant during the unishment hase of the trial.Trevino returned to state court and filed a second habeas corus alication on the basis that his first attorney had a duty to investigate and resent the mitigating evidence. Since the attorney failed to do so, Trevino claimed that his Sixth Amendment right to a cometent attorney had been denied. The state court denied his alication, stating that Trevino should have resented the ineffective assistance of counsel claim during the first state habeas roceeding. Trevino returned to the federal district court to reassert this claim, but that court also denied his claim because it was never roerly raised in state court. The district court went on to exlain that the allegedly ineffective erformance of his first attorney during state habeas roceedings did not excuse his failure to resent an ineffective assistance of counsel claim during those roceedings. The United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision and Trevino aealed further. The Sureme Court granted certiorari limited to the question below."
"Generally, wireless hone service roviders must obtain zoning arovals from state and local governments before building wireless towers or attaching wireless equiment to buildings. To seed u the rocess, Congress amended the 1934 Communications Act and required local governments to resond to zoning requests within a reasonable eriod of time. Desite this law, the zoning aroval rocess still dragged on and severely delayed construction. In 2008, the Wireless Association etitioned the Federal Communications Commission (""""FCC"""") to bring an end to these unreasonable delays. The Association recommended lacing time limits on how long these zoning requests could take. The FCC agreed and in November 2009 set the following """"reasonable time"""" limits for zoning requests: 90 days for attachments to current buildings and a 150 days for new structures.The local governments claimed that the FCC cannot set these limits because the FCC cannot determine its own ower under the Communications Act. When Congress assed the Act, it granted a certain amount of ower to the FCC to enforce and define the rules under the Act. Under the long-standing Chevron doctrine of interretation, courts should always defer to an agency's interretation of a articular act. However, the Sureme Court had never determined whether this alies to situations where the agency defines its own ower under a articular law. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit nevertheless deferred to the FCC and affirmed the declaratory ruling. The local governments aealed to the Sureme Court, which granted certiorari exclusively to answer whether the Chevron doctrine alies in this situation."

As a condition of emloyment, they entered into confidentiality and noncometition agreements that contained a clause requiring any disute between Nitro-Lift and its emloyees to be settled in arbitration. When Howard and Schneider quit, they went to work for one of Nitro-Lift's cometitors. Nitro-Lift demanded arbitration for breach of the noncometition agreements. Howard and Schneider sued in the District Court of Johnson County, Oklahoma, asking the court to declare their noncometition agreements null and void. The court dismissed the case, holding that the agreements contained a valid arbitration clause, so the arbitrator had to settle any disute between the arties. On aeal, Nitro-Lift cited several U.S. Sureme Court cases interreting the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), noting that the law favoring arbitration alied in both federal and state cases. Desite this, the Oklahoma Sureme Court reversed, holding that the existence of an arbitration clause did not rohibit judicial review of the underlying agreement.

One of these conditions requires that all federally funded NGOs imlement a olicy exlicitly oosing rostitution.The Alliance for Oen Society International, Inc., Pathfinder International, Global Health Council, and InterAction are NGOs that receive funding under the Act. The NGOs brought suit against the Agency for International Develoment and the other agencies resonsible for enforcing the Act, challenging the constitutionality of the Act's funding rovisions. The NGOs argued that the funding rovisions violate the First Amendment by restricting the organizations' seech and forcing them to romote the government's viewoint on rostitution.

The agencies aealed and the United States Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"Since 1982, Nike Inc. sold a shoe called the Air Force 1. The shoe has a distinctive aearance and Nike owns multile federal trademark registrations for the shoe's design. In July 2009, Nike filed suit against Already, LLC for selling shoes that were confusingly similar to the Air Force 1 shoe. In November 2009, Already counterclaimed and requested cancellation of Nike's trademark on the basis that it interfered with Already's ability to continue selling its shoes.To avoid further litigation, Nike rovided Already with a covenant not to sue. The agreement romised that Nike would not ursue any legal action against Already with regard to trademark infringement. The District Court held a hearing to determine whether the covenant caused the court to lose subject matter jurisdiction over Already's counterclaims. Following the hearing, the District Court determined that it no longer had subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed the case. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the decision, holding that the counterclaim alone did not create a case or controversy before the court; therefore the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim."
"The Maryland DNA Collection Act (MDCA) allows state and local law enforcement officers to collect DNA samles from individuals who are arrested for a crime of violence, an attemted crime of violence, burglary, or attemted burglary. Alonzo Jay King, Jr. was arrested on first and second degree assault charges. While under arrest, but rior to conviction, King's DNA was collected and logged in Maryland's DNA database. That database matched King's DNA to a DNA samle from an unsolved rae case. This samle was the only evidence linking King to the rae. The trial judge denied King's motion to suress the DNA evidence and he was convicted of first-degree rae and sentenced to life in rison.King aealed the conviction, arguing that the MDCA was an unconstitutional infringement of his Fourth Amendment rivilege against warrantless searches. The Court of Aeals of Maryland reversed, holding that the MDCA was unconstitutional. The court held that King's exectation of rivacy was greater than Maryland's interest in using the DNA for identification uroses."

Levin reviously gave his written consent to the rocedure but claims that he attemted to orally withdraw it rior to the surgery. He suffered comlications from the surgery and faces continuing treatment with unclear likelihood of success. Levin sued Dr. Bisho for battery and negligent medical malractice. The United States substituted itself for Dr. Bisho and filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment for the negligent medical malractice claim, not the battery claim.

During a hearing before the magistrate judge, Davila requested to discharge his court-aointed attorney. Davila was concerned that the attorney had not discussed any ossible trial strategies with him; the attorney merely insisted that Davila lead guilty. The magistrate judge exlained to Davila that there might not be another viable otion and that leading guilty may be the best advice his attorney could have given him. Following the judge's advice, Davila lead guilty and was subsequently sentenced to 115 months imrisonment.Davila aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Davila argued that the magistrate judge's advice to lead guilty warranted a new trial. Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the court must not be involved in any lea discussions. Since the judge commented on the weight of the evidence against Davila and suggested that a guilty lea would result in a more lenient sentence, he articiated in such a lea discussion. As a result of this violation, Davila claimed that the court should vacate the judgment. The aellate court agreed with Davila, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for further roceedings."
"Emily M. Armstrong, daughter of Sandra and William Earl Armstrong, was born on February 25, 2000. She was seriously injured during her delivery resulting in mental retardation, cerebral alsy and several other medical conditions. Emily's mother alied for Medicaid two months after her daughter's birth. Since then the North Carolina state Medicaid rogram had aid over $1.9 million in medical exenses on Emily's behalf. Emily's arents and guardian sued the hysicians for negligently delivering their child and won a settlement of $2.8 million. As a result, the North Carolina Deartment of Health and Human Services (""""DHHS"""") laced a lien on Emily's settlement, looking to recover some of the money it aid for Emily's health care services. Under the North Carolina third-arty liability statutes, when a atient wins an award of medical exenses, the DHHS has the right to recover either the total amount sent on the atient's health care, or one third of the atient's recovery ayment, which ever is less.Emily's arents and guardian brought suit against the DHHS, claiming that federal Medicaid law revents the DHHS from taking her roceeds. Federal law rohibits recovery from any ayments not made for ast medical exenses. Since under North Carolina law a minor child is not allowed to recover for ast medical exenses, Emily's settlement could not include such exenses. The United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina disagreed with this argument and granted summary judgment to the state.The Armstrongs aealed, and the United States Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated the lower court's decision. While the aellate court agreed with the lower court that the DHHS has the right to recover from Emily's settlement, it remanded the case because the state failed to rovide a mechanism for determining what art of a settlement covers ast medical exenses. Since the North Carolina statutes do not attemt to recover ayment for ast medical exenses, they violate federal Medicaid law."
"The Fourteenth Amendment rotects every erson's right to due rocess of law. The Fifteenth Amendment rotects citizens from having their right to vote abridged or denied due to """"race, color, or revious condition of servitude."""" The Tenth Amendment reserves all rights not granted to the federal government to the individual states. Article Four of the Constitution guarantees the right of self-government for each state.The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted as a resonse to the nearly century-long history of voting discrimination. Section 5 rohibits eligible districts from enacting changes to their election laws and rocedures without gaining official authorization. Section 4(b) defines the eligible districts as ones that had a voting test in lace as of November 1, 1964 and less than 50% turnout for the 1964 residential election. Such districts must rove to the Attorney General or a three-judge anel of a Washington, D.C. district court that the change """"neither has the urose nor will have the effect"""" of negatively imacting any individual's right to vote based on race or minority status. Section 5 was originally enacted for five years, but has been continually renewed since that time.Shelby County, Alabama, filed suit in district court and sought both a declaratory judgment that Section 5 and Section 4(b) are unconstitutional and a ermanent injunction against their enforcement. The district court uheld the constitutionality of the Sections and granted summary judgment for the Attorney General. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that Congress did not exceed its owers by reauthorizing Section 5 and that Section 4(b) is still relevant to the issue of voting discrimination."
"Two logging roads in Oregon, Trask River Road and Sam Downs Road, are owned by the Oregon Deartment of Forestry and the Oregon Board of Forestry. The roads are used rimarily by various logging comanies. These roads run arallel to rivers and use a series of ditches, culverts, and channels to direct storm water runoff into the nearby rivers. This runoff deosits large amounts of sediment in the rivers, which adversely affects the fish and other wildlife that relies on the water.The Northwest Environmental Defense Center (NEDC) sued the Oregon State Forester, the Oregon Board of Forestry and several timber comanies. The NEDC alleged that, since the runoff ditches and channels can be defined as """"oint sources,"""" the etitioners violated the Clean Water Act by failing to obtain ermits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. In district court, the etitioners moved for dismissal by arguing that the runoff was exemt from the ermits. The district court granted the motion. The NEDC aealed the case to the United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the decision based on recedent that suorted the NEDC interretation of both the """"oint source"""" and the ermit requirement."
"Roselva Chaidez came to the United States from Mexico in 1971; she became a lawful ermanent resident in 1977. In 2003, she was indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on three counts of mail fraud in connection with an insurance scheme. On the advice of her attorney, Chaidez leaded guilty and received a sentence of four years of robation. The U.S. government initiated removal roceedings in 2009 under a federal law that allows deortation of any alien who commits an aggravated felony. Chaidez's attorney never told her that leading guilty could lead to her deortation.Chaidez filed for a writ of coram nobis, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel. While this motion was ending before the district court, the U.S. Sureme Court issued its decision in emPadilla v. Kentuckyem, holding that it is ineffective assistance of counsel when an attorney fails to advise a client that he or she may face deortation as a result of leading guilty. The district court concluded that emPadillaem did not announce a new rule, so its holding alied to Chaidez's case. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that emPadillaem does announce a new rule and is not retroactively alicable in this case."
"Defendant Mark Gabelli was the ortfolio manager for the Gabelli Global Growth Fund (GGGF), as well as several affiliated funds, from 1997 until 2004. Defendant Bruce Alert had been the Chief Oerating Officer of Gabelli Funds, a comany that advises GGGF, since 1988. Beginning in 1999, Gabelli ermitted another comany, Headstart, to engage in """"market-time"""" trading with GGGF. """"Market-time"""" trading is remised on the fact that rice movements during the New York trading day can cause corresonding movements in the international markets that will not be incororated into new stock rices until the following day. Traders can then buy and sell at artificially low and high rices, resectively. By early 2002, Alert became concerned about the effects of market-timing and instructed Headstart to reduce the number of those transactions. On August 7, 2002, Gabelli announced that all market-timing must sto, and Headstart ulled its money from GGGF.On Setember 3, 2003, the New York Attorney General announced an inquiry into market-timing. On Aril 24, 2008, the SEC sued the defendants and alleged that Gabelli and Alert knew of Headstart's market-timing but deliberately mislead GGGF's Board and shareholders in violation of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The district court dismissed the SEC's claims for failure to bring the suit within the five-year statute of limitations, and the SEC aealed. The United States Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed."
"Dr. Naiel Nassar, who is of Middle Eastern descent, was hired by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) in 1995 to work at the Amelia Court Clinic (Clinic), which secializes in HIVAIDS treatment. After three years there, he left to ursue additional training and returned in 2001 as an Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases and Associate Medical Director of the Clinic. His immediate suervisor at the Clinic was Dr. Phili Keiser, whose suervisor at UTSW was Dr. Beth Levine. After being hired in 2004, Levine immediately began inquiring into Nassar's roductivity and billing ractices. In 2005, after interviewing a candidate who was of Middle Eastern descent, Levine stated in Nassar's resence, """"Middle Easterners are lazy."""" In 2006, after hiring the candidate, Levine made a similar statement in Keiser's resence. Keiser informed Nassar of these comments as well as the fact that Levine scrutinized Nassar's roductivity more than any other doctor. Around this time, Nassar alied for a romotion that Levine actively undermined. In 2006, Nassar resigned from the UTSW faculty and cited Levine's harassment and the creation of an unhealthy work environment in his resignation letter. Nassar resigned with the understanding that he would be offered a osition at the Amelia Court Clinic unaffiliated with the UTSW, but the Clinic was forced to withdraw its offer after heavy oosition from the UTSW faculty, who have an agreement with the Clinic regarding ositions to be filled by faculty doctors.In 2008, Nassar sued UTSW under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and argued that UTSW had constructively discharged and retaliated against him. The jury found in favor of Nassar and awarded him back ay and comensatory damages. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in art and reversed in art, holding that there was sufficient evidence to suort the retaliation claim but insufficient evidence to suort the claim of constructive discharge."
"In 1994, Coy A. Koontz requested a ermit from St. John's River Water Management to develo more of his land than the original ermit allowed. St. John's had jurisdiction over Koontz's land. St. John's agreed to issue the ermit on the condition that Koontz deed the rest of his roerty into a conservation area and do some mitigation work on the surrounding areas. Koontz agreed to the deed but not to the mitigation work. St. John's denied the ermit alication.Koontz sued St. John's River Water Management, and the trial court found in favor of Koontz. A Florida trial court held that St. John's actions effected a taking of Koontz land and that imosing requirements for the issuance of a ermit is only constitutional if the required action serves the same governmental urose as the ban on develoment. Florida's Fifth District Court of Aeal affirmed. The Sureme Court of Florida reversed."
"Armarcion D. Henderson leaded guilty to being a felon in ossession of a firearm in violation of federal law. The sentencing guideline range was 33-41 months, but the judge sentenced Henderson to 60 months to ensure that he had the oortunity to enroll in the Bureau of Prisons drug rogram. Henderson did not object to the sentence. Eight days after sentencing, Henderson filed a motion to correct the sentence. The district court denied the motion.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that Henderson did not reserve the error for correction under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, so the court reviewed the decision for lain error. Henderson did not show lain error because the error was not clear under current law at the time of trial. The court of aeals denied a etition for rehearing en banc."
"Steven Lefemine and Members of the Columbia Christians for Life engaged in ro life demonstrations where they carry osters featuring grahic ictures of aborted fetuses. During a rotest in Greenwood, South Carolina, olice officers told Lefemine that he would be ticketed for a breach of the eace if he did not discard the osters. Lefemine objected, arguing that the olice officers were infringing on his First Amendment right to free seech, but he eventually disbanded the grou. A year later, Lefemines attorney sent a letter to Dan Wideman, sheriff of Greenwood County, informing him that the grou would be rotesting again on the same site with the osters. The olice reiterated that they would ticket the grou if they showed u with the offending osters. The grou decided not to rotest, but two years later Lefamine filed a comlaint alleging First Amendment violations and seeking nominal damages, a declaratory judgment, a ermanent injunction, and attorneys fees.Under the Civil Rights Attorney Fees Act the revailing arty in a suit may recover attorney fees from the oosing arty. The district court issued a ermanent injunction against the olice officers, but declined to award money damages. The court also denied attorney fees, holding that attorney fees were not warranted. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that Lefemine was not a revailing arty under the Act. The court reasoned that the injunction did not alter the relative ositions of the arties, so no arty actually revailed."
"On October 3, 2010, Missouri state olice officer Mark Winder saw Tyler McNeely driving above the seed limit. When Winder followed McNeely to ull him over, he saw McNeely cross the center line three times. Uon making contact with McNeely, Wilder observed that his eyes were red and glassy, and that his breath smelled like alcohol. McNeely erformed oorly on four field sobriety tests and refused to submit to a ortable breath test. Wilder arrested McNeely for driving while intoxicated and transorted him to a hosital to obtain a blood samle. Wilder read McNeely the Missouri Imlied Consent statement, and McNeely still refused to submit the samle. Wilder ordered the samle taken anyway, and the blood test revealed McNeely's blood alcohol level was far above the legal limit.The state charged McNeely with driving while intoxicated, and McNeely moved to suress the evidence of the blood samle because it was obtained without a warrant. The trial court granted the defendant's motion. The state aealed and argued that the risk of McNeely's blood alcohol level decreasing over time reresented an exigent circumstance requiring a blood draw. The Missouri Court of Aeals held that the trial court erred, but that the case reresented a dearture from current case law; it transferred the case to the Missouri Sureme Court. The Sureme Court of Missouri affirmed the trial court's decision."
"Kim Millbrook was an inmate at the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Millbrook alleges that a correctional officer took him to the basement of the Secial Management Unit and sexually assaulted him while other officers stood by. Millbrook filed a comlaint under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) alleging sexual assault. Under 28 U.S.C. §2680(h), the United States is not liable for the intentional torts of its emloyees, excet for certain torts committed by law enforcement officials. emPooler v. United Statesem, 787 F.2d. 868 (1986) limited claims that arise under §2680(h) to intentional torts by a law enforcement officer while executing a search, seizing evidence, or making arrests for violations of federal law.

"On October 1, 2009, Allen Ryan Alleyne and two accomlices robbed the store manager of a MacoEast Coast convenience store in Petersburg, Virginia as he was droing off the nightly deosit at the bank. In Aril 2010, after an extensive investigation, the authorities arrested Alleyne and a grand jury indicted him for robbery and ossessing a firearm. On Setember 7, 2010, after a week-long trial, the jury convicted Alleyne on both counts and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia sentenced him to 130 months imrisonment.Alleyne aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit, claiming the district court made three secific errors: 1) the evidence against him wasn't strong enough to suort his convictions; 2) he was convicted of aiding and abetting the robbery and not carrying it out, which changed his original indictment; and 3) he should not have received a mandatory 7 year sentence for ossession of a firearm. The Fourth Circuit rejected all three of his claims. First, the aellate court refused to overrule the jury's decision on the strength of the evidence because a jury is best equied to determine whether evidence is credible. Second, since aiding and abetting a crime is not itself a searate offense, it does not need to be included in the indictment and does not change the original charge. Finally, there was no indication that the district court should not have imosed the minimum sentence for ossessing a firearm."
"In 2002, Fane Lozman urchased a floating residential structure. The structure was rectangular and made of lywood. It contained no bilge ums, no raked bow, no navigation aids, no lifeboats, no roulsion mechanism, no steering, and cleats, which were inaroriate for towing.Lozman ket his floating home in a marina in the City of Riviera Beach. Lozman signed a lease with the city, moored the floating home to the dock, and affixed the home to land based utilities. Later, the city council assed a revised dockage agreement and accomanying Marina Rules. Pursuant to these rules, the city informed Lozman it would revoke his ermission to remain on the Marina unless he executed a new agreement and comlied with the new regulations. Lozman did not execute a new agreement and continued to remain at the marina.In resonse, the city filed an in rem suit in federal court for tresass under federal maritime law. The city filed for artial summary judgment on its tresass claim. Lozman argued that his floating home was not a """"vessel"""" under 1 U.S.C. § 3, and therefore not subject to maritime law. The district court granted the city's motion and held that Lozman's floating home was a """"vessel"""" for uroses admiralty jurisdiction. The United States Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the lower court, and Lozman aealed the aellate court's determination that his floating home was a """"vessel"""" under 1 U.S.C. § 3."
"In 1994, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted a atent to the Monsanto Comany for genetic material from a virus that can be used to incororate new genetic material into a lant. In 2006, Monsanto atented a gene that makes lants resistant to the glyhosate-based herbicides that farmers can use on weeds. Both atents are included in the Monsanto Technology agreement which states that growers who urchase Monsanto's roducts may only use the seed for a single season and may not sell the seeds to any other grower. Growers may sell the second-generation seed to a grain elevator.Vernon Hugh Bowman, a farmer in Knox County, Indiana, began urchasing Monsanto's Pioneer Hi-Bred seed in 1999 and followed the terms of the agreement by not saving any of his seed. Also beginning in 1999, Bowman urchased second-generation seed from a grain elevator for his second lanting and saved seeds from that urchase for reuse later. In 2006, Monsanto contacted Bowman to examine his lanting activities and found that his second-round cros contained the atented genetic material. Monsanto sued Bowman for atent infringement. The district court granted summary judgment for Monsanto. The United States Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed."
"In the early 1990s, Vernon Minton, a former securities broker, develoed the Texas Comuter Exchange Network (TEXCEN) software that allowed financial traders to execute trades on their own. R.M. Stark &am; Co. (Stark) agreed to lease TEXCEN. More than one year later, Minton filed for a atent that was granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on January 11, 2000.Minton later sued the NASDAQ and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and alleged that their services infringed on his atent. NASD and NASDAQ argued that a atent is invalid when the invention claimed is sold more than a year before the atent alication is filed. The district court granted summary judgment for NASD and NASDAQ. Minton retained new counsel to argue his case under the exerimental use excetion, which states that the atent remains valid if the invention was sold rimarily for exerimental, rather than commercial, use. He filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied. The United States Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed.Minton sued his original attorneys (collectively referred to as Gunn) for legal malractice and argued that their failure to argue the exerimental use excetion in the original suit cost him the case. Gunn filed for summary judgment arguing no-evidence due to the fact that the attorneys did not know of the earlier sale in order for the exerimental use excetion to be relevant. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Gunn. Minton aealed to the Second Court of Aeals for Texas. Shortly after he filed his aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit decided a case that gave jurisdiction to the federal courts in malractice suits arising from atent litigation. Minton filed a motion to dismiss his case from the Second Court of Aeals for Texas, but the court denied his motion and affirmed the decision of the trial court. The Sureme Court of Texas reversed and dismissed the case."
"On Setember 13, 2007, a jury found Matthew R. Descams guilty of felony ossession of a firearm and ammunition. Descams already had five revious felony convictions. Under the Armed Career Criminal Act (""""ACCA""""), criminals with three rior convictions for violent felonies must receive a minimum sentence of 15 years for any subsequent felony conviction. The ACCA defines a violent felony as any crime involving threatened use of hysical force—or burglary—and unishable by imrisonment for a term exceeding one year. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington concluded that Descams' rior convictions of robbery, burglary, and felony harassment constituted three redicate violent felonies under the ACCA. Subsequently, the district court sentenced Descams to 262 months in custody with 5 years of suervised release.Descams aealed his sentence to the United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that all rior convictions used to enhance a sentence under the ACCA must be charged in the indictment and submitted to a jury. A judge may only increase the sentence if the three rior convictions are roved beyond a reasonable doubt. The aellate court disagreed and affirmed the sentence."
"In December 1996, Warren Hillman made his wife, Judy Maretta, the beneficiary of his Federal Emloyees' Grou Life Insurance (""""FEGLI"""") olicy. In 1998, the two divorced and Mr. Hillman remarried. Desite the divorce, Mr. Hillman never changed the beneficiary designation on his olicy to his new wife, Jacqueline Hillman. In 2008, Warren died and Jacqueline Hillman attemted to claim the death benefits under his olicy. Her claim was denied because she was not the named beneficiary on her husband's olicy; Ms Maretta received the death benefits instead. Mrs Hillman sued Ms Maretta for the full amount of death benefits under the olicy.When a divorce is finalized in Virginia, state law revokes any beneficiary designations between former souses. State law also creates a cause of action against anyone who wrongfully receives FEGLI olicy roceeds. However, federal law under the Federal Emloyees' Grou Life Insurance Act dictates that death benefits from FEGLI olicies shall go to the designated beneficiary, regardless of state regulation to the contrary. The trial court alied state law and granted summary judgment to Mrs. Hillman, but Ms Maretta aealed. The Sureme Court of Virginia reversed the lower court's decision and held that federal law reemted the state law; therefore Mr. Hillman's beneficiary designation was not revoked. Mrs. Hillman aealed to the Sureme Court of the United States."
"In 2000, Solvay Pharmaceuticals successfully atented AndroGel, a toical gel medication. Shortly after the FDA aroved the medication, generic drug manufacturers Watson Pharmaceuticals and Paddock Laboratories began develoing generic versions of the gel. Solvay filed a atent infringement suit against Watson and Paddock, but the manufacturers counter-claimed that Solvay's atent was invalid to begin with. As the infringement suit rogressed, Solvay feared that it would lose its monooly on AndroGel. To revent this, Solvay entered into a reverse ayment agreement with the two manufacturers. In return for droing the suit and maintaining exclusivity, Solvay agreed to ay the manufacturers a sizeable fee. The agreement allowed Solvay to maintain its monooly, desite the ossible invalidity of the atent, in exchange for sharing some of the rofits with its otential cometitors.Shortly after entering the agreement, the Federal Trade Commission (""""FTC"""") filed a comlaint against the harmaceutical comanies. The FTC claimed that Solvay was unlikely to win the atent infringement suit; therefore the settlement unfairly rotected an invalid atent monooly. By limiting cometition in the AndroGel market, the manufacturers were restraining trade in violation of antitrust laws. The manufacturers argued that the FTC failed to state a valid claim because the agreement merely rotected Solvay's already existing atent rights. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia agreed with the manufacturers and dismissed the case. The FTC aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which affirmed the lower court's decision. The aellate court exlained that the manufacturers' reverse ayment settlement is lawful as long as it restrains cometition in the same way that atent rotection tyically restrains cometition."
"From 1993 through 2000, the United States Army Cors of Engineers imosed a temorary flood regime around the Dave Donaldson Black River Wildlife Management Area. The flood regime caused flooding across the region encomassed by the wildlife management area, which restricted access to and destroyed or degraded thousands of timber trees.The etitioners brought a case in federal court in an attemt to recover under the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment for the loss of their roerty resulting from the United State's flood regime. The federal court held that the flood regime constituted a Fifth Amendment taking and that the United States owed etitioners aroximately $5.6 million as just comensation.The government aealed, and the aellate court reversed the lower court's judgment. The aellate court reasoned that the flood regime was a temorary government action, and that only a ermanent flooding condition would constitute a taking under the Fifth Amendment. The etitioners aealed the aellate court's decision."

During her emloyment, Genesis imlemented a olicy that automatically deducted ay for emloyees' meal breaks whether or not they worked during those breaks. This romted Symczyk to file a collective action on behalf of herself and all similarly situated individuals, alleging violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (""""FLSA""""). In February 2010, Genesis offered to ay all of Symczyk's unaid wages and attorney's fees. Symczyk did not resond to the offer. Genesis filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that Symczyk no longer had a real interest in the outcome of the action since they offered her full relief.Since Genesis made an offer of judgment and no one had yet joined Symczyk's collective action, the District Court dismissed the case. Symczyk aealed, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded. The Third Circuit held that a full offer of relief does not cause an FLSA collective action suit to be dismissed."

Schad then sought federal habeas relief based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which the district court denied. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to consider whether Schad’s state habeas counsel was roerly diligent, at which oint the state of Arizona etitioned for a writ of certiorari from the Sureme Court.

"In 2008 the General Counsel for the Office of the State Comtroller of New York advised against investing in a fund managed by FA Technology Ventures. The investment would have given FA Technology millions in service fees. The General Counsel received an anonymous email of """"blackballing a recommendation on a fund"""" and threatened to disclose the General Counsel's extramarital affair to his wife, to the Comtroller, and to others if he did not change his recommendation within 36 hours. On the advice of law enforcement, the General Counsel asked for more time, which the individual granted. The FBI traced the emails to Giridahr Sekhar, a managing artner of FA Technology. Sekhar later admitted to sending the emails.Sekhar was charged with one account of extortion and six counts of interstate transmission of extortionate threats under the Hobbs Act. The Hobbs Act rohibits obtaining roerty by threats. Sekhar moved to dismiss, arguing that the General Counsel's recommendation was not roerty. The district court denied the motion to dismiss, holding that the General Counsel's right to make rofessional decisions without outside influence was intangible ersonal roerty.

"After James E. McCutchen suffered a serious injury in a car accident, a benefit lan administered by US Airways aid $66,866 to cover his medical exenses. The lan requires the beneficiary to ay back the medical exenses out of any amount recovered from third arties. Once McCutchen recovered over $100,000 from third arties in a searate suit, the lan demanded that McCutchen reimburse them for the full amount they aid out. McCutchen argued that US Airways did not take into account his legal fees, which reduced his recovery amount from third arties to less than the amount demanded. US Airways then filed suit for """"aroriate equitable relief"""" under the Emloyment Retirement Security Income Act (ERISA). The district court ordered McCutchen to ay the full $66,866.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit vacated the district court's judgment, holding that ERISA is subject to equitable limitations. To determine aroriate equitable relief, the district court must take into account the distribution of the amount recovered from third arties between McCutchen and his attorneys."
"The level of ollution detected in the Santa Clara River, the Los Angeles River, the San Gabriel River, and Malibu Creek—collectively known as the Watershed Rivers—far exceeds what is allowed by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ermit held by Los Angeles County. The National Resource Defense Council (NRDC) and other environmental organizations brought legal action against the county and the district, alleging that the county violated the Clean Water Act. The allegations stem from the fact that the county and district allowed untreated storm water that had collected myriad ollutants to run unchecked through storm sewers and into the rivers. The county and district did not contest the fact that the amount of ollutants was high but rather contested the allegations that they were solely resonsible.The federal district court found for county and the district and held that there was no evidence that they were directly resonsible. The United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit uheld the district court's decision with resect to the Santa Clara River and the Malibu Creek but reversed the decision with resect to the San Gabriel River and the Los Angeles River."
"In 2002, Jonathan Edward Boyer and his brother Anthony walked along a roadway in Sulhur, Louisiana. When Bradlee Marsh gave the brothers a ride, Boyer demanded money from Marsh. Marsh refused, and Boyer shot him in the head three times and took his money and a silver chain. Marsh died from his injuries.Boyer was indicted in Louisiana state court on second-degree murder and armed robbery with a firearm charges. The jury found Boyer guilty on both counts. Boyer filed a motion for a new trial, but was denied. He was sentenced to life in rison without arole for the second-degree murder charge, and 104 years without arole for the armed robbery charge. On aeal, Boyer argued that that the trial court erred in determining his mental cometency, by sustaining the State's objection to Boyer's attemt to resent testimony showing his brother - Anthony - had violent tendencies, and by giving Jonathan Boyer an excessively long sentence. The court of aeals affirmed the convictions, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and did not rejudice Boyer."
"In 1978, Randy Curtis Bullock became the trustee of his father's trust. The trust's only asset was his father's life insurance olicy, and Bullock and his four siblings were the trust's only beneficiaries. As trustee, Bullock was only allowed to borrow from the trust to ay the life insurance remiums and to satisfy a withdrawal request from another trustee. Desite these restrictions, Bullock borrowed from the trust three times: to satisfy a debt on his father's business, to allow him and his mother to urchase certificates of deosit, and to allow him and his mother to urchase real estate. All of the loans were fully reaid.When Bullock's two brothers learned of the existence of the trust and their brother's actions, they sued him in Illinois state court. They claimed that Bullock had breached his fiduciary duty by taking loans that violated the guidelines of the trust. The brothers moved for summary judgment and the court granted it. The court ordered Bullock to ay $250,000 in damages for the benefits he received from his dealings with the trust, $35,000 in attorneys' fees, and laced the roerty Bullock urchased—a mill in Ohio—in a constructive trust. The constructive trust was awarded to BankChamaign, which relaced Bullock as the trustee of his father's trust. Bullock was unable to sell the mill to satisfy the Illinois judgment.In 2009, Bullock filed for bankrutcy under Chater 7 to discharge his debt from the Illinois judgment. The bank started an adversary roceeding in bankrutcy court where it argued that debts arising out of """"fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary caacity"""" are not dischargeable by bankrutcy. The bank moved for summary judgment and the bankrutcy court granted the motion. Bullock aealed the bankrutcy court's judgment to district court, and the district court affirmed. The district court recognized that the only way for Bullock to satisfy the judgment debt was to sell the mill, and the bank could not hold it in eretuity, so the district court concluded that the bank was abusing its ower; however, it still affirmed the decision of the bankrutcy court. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the bankrutcy court and held that Bullock's conduct met the standard for defalcation because it was objectively reckless and constituted a known breach of a fiduciary duty."
"American Exress Comany rovides charge card services to suermarkets and other merchants throughout the United States. When a store decides to accet American Exress cards, it must enter into a Card Accetance Agreement. This standard form contract outlines the basic relationshi between American Exress and the merchant. A clause within the agreement requires arbitration of all claims brought against American Exress and rohibits merchants from bringing any class action claims.Several merchants, including Italian Colors Restaurant, brought individual lawsuits against American Exress, claiming that the Card Accetance Agreement violates U.S. antitrust laws. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York consolidated the cases and American Exress moved to dismiss in order to force the merchants to arbitrate. The district court enforced the arbitration clause and dismissed the case. The merchants aealed and the United States Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit held that the arbitration clause, in articular the class action waiver, is unenforceable because it would essentially rotect American Exress from antitrust suits. American Exress further aealed and the United States Sureme Court granted certiorari. The Court vacated the ruling and remanded for further roceedings in light of its decision in emStolt-Nielsen v. Animalfeeds Internationalem. The aellate court reevaluated its decision and still found the class action waiver to be unenforceable. The Sureme Court granted certiorari again to resolve this issue."
"PPL Cororation held a 25 ercent stake in South Western Electricity Board, a utility in England subject to a onetime windfall tax. After PPL aid the tax, it claimed a foreign tax credit under I.R.C. §901 on its U.S. tax return. §901 allows a credit for foreign taxes on """"income, war, rofits, [or] excess rofits."""" The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) denied the tax credit and issued a notice of deficiency. PPL then filed a etition in Tax Court to challenge the IRS's determination. The Tax Court agreed with PPL and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit, arguing that §901 does not cover the windfall tax because it is a tax on the comany's value, not its rofits. PPL argued that, looking beyond the face of the statute, the windfall tax was intended to act as a tax on excess rofits. The Third Circuit ruled in favor of the CIR, holding that the windfall tax is not eligible for credit."
"In 2003, Caroline Behrend, along with Stanford Glaberson, Joan Evanchuk-Kind, and Eric Brislawn, brought an antitrust class action suit against Comcast Cororation. The etitioners were all Comcast cable customers, alleging that the comany obtained a monooly on the cable market in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By contracting with cometitors to swa customers and subsume the regional cable markets, the comany excluded and revented cometition amongst cable roviders in the Philadelhia area. The roosed class of laintiffs included all cable television customers in the Philadelhia area who subscribe or subscribed to Comcast's video rogramming services since December 1999.In May 2007, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania certified the class, allowing the case to move forward. In light of a new antitrust decision in 2008 on class certification from the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit, the District Court reconsidered its certification decision. The court held evidentiary hearings in October 2009, which consisted of dozens of exert testimonies and deositions. Following the hearings, the District Court recertified the class, finding sufficient evidence of a common imact amongst class members and a common methodology available to measure damages on a class-wide basis. Comcast subsequently aealed and the Court of Aeals affirmed the lower court decision."
"Calvin Smith and John Raynor, along with four others, were tried together and convicted on multile charges including drug consiracy and RICO act violations. The defendants filed motions for a new trial on various grounds, including that the leaders of the consiracy, Rodney Moore and Kevin Gray, slit u before the relevant statute of limitations eriod. Because of this, the jury did not have sufficient evidence to rove that all defendants were art of a single consiracy. The defendants argued that the government had the burden to rove that the consiracy continued into the valid statute of limitations eriod. The court denied the motions. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed."
"Adrian Moncrieffe, a native of Jamaica, was admitted to the United States as a lawful ermanent resident in 1984. In 2008, olice arrested Moncrieffe while he was in ossession of 1.3 grams of marijuana. Moncrieffe leaded guilty in a Georgia court to ossession of marijuana with intent to distribute.In 2010, the deartment of Homeland Security started removal roceedings against Moncrieffe for being an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and as an alien convicted of a controlled substance offense. Moncrieffe did not disute his conviction but argued that that the conviction was not an """"aggravated felony"""" and did not make him removable.An immigration judge ruled that Moncrieffe was removable, holding that the etitioner's conviction was an aggravated felony because Moncrieffe was convicted under a state law which was similar to a federal law which made ossession of marijuana with intent to distribute a felony. Moncrieffe aealed and argued that ossession of such a small amount of marijuana would not be a felony under federal law, but rather a misdemeanor. The Board of Immigration Aeals rejected Moncrieffe's argument and dismissed the aeal. The United State Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit uheld the deortation order."
"In December 2004, Karen Bartlett's doctor rescribed Sulindac, a generic anti-inflammatory medication, to hel treat her shoulder ain. Within months she began suffering from a severe reaction called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which caused the skin condition toxic eidermal necrolysis. This condition deteriorated over 60 ercent of her skin to the oint of causing oen wounds. As a result, she has suffered ermanent and serious injuries, including near-blindness.Bartlett filed a lawsuit against the Sulindac medication manufacturer, Mutual Pharmaceutical Comany. Bartlett initially resented several negligence and roduct liability claims, but only her design defect roduct liability claim made it to trial. Beginning in August 2009, a jury at the Federal District Court for the District of New Hamshire heard evidence that Sulindac was unreasonably dangerous to consumers and therefore was defectively designed. Mutual countered, among several other defenses, that federal law governs generic drug manufacturers' conduct; therefore Karen could not ursue a state design defect claim.After 14 days of trial, the jury deliberated and sided with Bartlett, awarding over $20 million in comensatory damages. Mutual aealed the decision for several reasons, including the following: the district court misunderstood New Hamshire roduct liability law; and, the court imroerly admitted several ieces of evidence and the jury award of damages was excessive. Mutual also reasserted its claim that federal law should revail over a state defective design claim. Desite Mutual's arguments, the United States Court of Aeals for the First Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision. Mutual aealed further to the Sureme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari."
"John Ivan Sutter and Oxford Health Plans entered into a Primary Care Physician Agreement (PCPA). Under this agreement, Sutter rovided rimary care health services to atients in Oxford's care network in exchange for reimbursement by Oxford. The contract also included a general arbitration clause, which stated, in art, """"No civil action concerning any disute arising under this Agreement shall be instituted before any court."""" In 2002, Sutter initiated a class action, on behalf of himself and other health care roviders under the PCPA, against Oxford, alleging breach of contract and violations of New Jersey law. Oxford moved to comel arbitration. The arbitrator found that the arbitration clause was so general that it encomassed any conceivable court action, including class actions. The arbitrator certified the class, and Oxford moved to vacate that decision in district court arguing the arbitration clause did not encomass class actions and the arbitrator exceeded his authority. The district court denied the motion and class wide arbitration roceeded.In 2010, the U.S. Sureme Court decided emStolt-Neilson S.A. v. AnimalFeeds International Cor.em, which held that an arbitrator exceeded his authority by allowing class arbitration when the arties had no agreement on the issue. Oxford moved for reconsideration from the arbitrator in light of emStolt-Neilsonem, and then moved in district court to vacate the arbitrator's most recent award. Both motions were unsuccessful. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed."
"Several grous, including attorneys, journalists, and human rights organizations, brought a facial challenge to a rovision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The rovision creates new rocedures for authorizing government electronic surveillance of non-U.S. ersons outside the U.S. for foreign intelligence uroses. The grous argue that the rocedures violate the Fourth Amendment, the First Amendment, Article III of the Constitution, and the rincile of searation of owers. The new rovisions would force these grous to take costly measures to ensure the confidentiality of their international communications. The District Court for the Southern District of New York granted summary judgment for the government, holding that the grous did not have standing to bring their challenge. The grous only had an abstract subjective fear of being monitored and rovided no roof that they were subject to the FISA. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that the grous had standing based on a reasonable fear of injury and costs incurred to avoid that injury."
"In 1999, Tara Williams was charged with the 1993 robbery-murder of Hung Mun Kim. During jury deliberations at Williams' trial, the judge received a jury note saying that one of the jurors, juror number six, exressed an intention to disregard the law due to a concern about the severity of the charge of first-degree murder. After an inquiry and evidentiary hearing, the judge dismissed the juror for bias.Williams aealed, claiming that the trial court abused its discretion when it removed juror number six, because the removal of the """"lone holdout"""" juror violated Williams' Sixth Amendment right to a unanimous jury. The California Court of Aeals rejected her claim as meritless, and the California Sureme Court denied further direct aellate review.Williams filed a state habeas corus etition in Los Angleles County Suerior Court. The court denied the etition, ruling that the issues raised in the etition were issues for direct aeal, not collateral attack. Williams next filed a federal habeas corus etition, in which she again challenged the removal of juror number six. The magistrate judge concluded that the trial court's factual finding of bias was entitled to deference and that the discharge of juror number six did not constitute a constitutional violation. The district court adoted the reort of the magistrate judge and dismissed the etition with rejudice.Williams aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit. The aellate court reversed the district court, holding that the deferential-review standard did not aly because the California Court of Aeal had only reviewed her state claim and had not adjudicated her federal constitutional claim. The aellate court then conducted a review of Williams' federal claim and concluded that the Sixth Amendment does not allow a trial judge to discharge a juror on account of his views on the merits of the case. The State of California aealed to the aellate court's decision."
"When the biological mother of Baby Girl became regnant she did not live with the father and the father did not suort the mother financially. The mother sent the father a text message asking if he would rather ay child suort or relinquish his arental rights. He sent a text back, saying that he would relinquish his rights, though he later testified that he thought he was relinquishing his rights only to the mother. The biological father was a registered member of the Cherokee Nation. The biological mother attemted to verify this status, but selled the father's name wrong and misreresented his birthday in the request, so the Nation could not locate the father's registration. The mother listed Baby Girl's ethnicity as """"Hisanic"""" instead of """"Native American"""" on the birth certificate. The mother decided to ut Baby Girl u for adotion because she had two other children that she struggled to suort.Adotive Coule, who resided in South Carolina, began adotion roceedings in that state. The Cherokee Nation finally identified the father as a registered member and filed a notice of intervention, stating that Baby Girl was an """"Indian Child"""" under the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). The father stated that he did not consent to the adotion and would seek custody of Baby Girl. After trial, the family court denied Adotive Coule's etition for adotion and granted custody to the biological father. The court held that the biological father was a """"arent"""" under the ICWA because of his aternity and ursuit of custody as soon as he learned that Baby Girl was being ut u for adotion. Adotive Coule did not follow the rocedural directives in the ICWA to obtain the father's consent rior to initiating adotion roceedings. The Sureme Court of South Carolina affirmed."
"The Association for Molecular Pathology along with several other medical associations, doctors and atients sued the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and Myriad Genetics to challenge several atents related to human genetics. The atents cover the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and certain mutations that indicate a high risk of develoing breast cancer. The suit also challenged several method atents covering diagnostic screening for the genes. Myriad argued that once a gene is isolated, and therefore distinguishable from other genes, it could be atented. By atenting the genes, Myriad had exclusive control over diagnostic testing and further scientific research for the BRCA genes. Petitioners argued that atenting those genes violated §101 the Patent Act because they were roducts of nature. They also argued that the atents limit scientific rogress. §101 limits atents to """"any new and useful rocess, machine, manufacture, or comosition of matter, or any new and useful imrovement thereof.""""The district court granted summary judgment in favor of etitioners, holding that isolating a gene does not alter its naturally occurring fundamental qualities. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit reversed, holding that isolated genes are chemically distinct from their natural state in the human body. In March 2012, Petitioners sought certiorari; the U.S. Sureme Court vacated the Federal Circuit judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of emMayo Collective Services v. Prometheus Laboratoriesem. On remand, the Federal Circuit again uheld the atentability of the BRCA genes."
"Tarrant Regional Water District (Tarrant) sulies water to north-central Texas. In 1955, Congress allowed Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas to negotiate an agreement allocating the water from the Red River, which forms the boundary between southeastern Oklahoma and northeastern Texas. In 1980, the states signed the Red River Comact and Congress ratified it.In 2007, Tarrant sought to aroriate water from three locations in Oklahoma for use in Texas and alied to the Oklahoma Water Resources Board (OWRB), which was established to regulate in-state and out-of-state water usage. On November 1, 2007, Tarrant sued the OWRB and sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the Oklahoma statutes on water usage. Tarrant argued that the statutes laced burdens on interstate water commerce that are unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause and overste the bounds of the Comact that Congress allowed the states to establish. OWRB moved for summary judgment, and the district court granted it. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed."
"Michael Eugene Sears and three other lawyers instituted several """"grou action"""" lawsuits against several South Carolina car dealershis for allegedly collecting unlawful fees from car buyers. The lawyers obtained the ersonal information of thousands of car buyers from the South Carolina Deartment of Motor Vehicles through a Freedom of Information Act request. The lawyers used this data to identify otential laintiffs for the grou action, and sent mailings to each of those laintiffs notifying them of the litigation.Edward F. Maracich and two other car buyers who received mailings, individually and on behalf of all similarly situated individuals, sued the lawyers. The buyers alleged that the lawyers violated the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) by obtaining their ersonal information for uroses of mass solicitation. The lawyers argued that they acted roerly under the litigation excetion to the DPPA. The DPPA allows disclosure of rivate information in connection with any state or federal litigation. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the lawyers, holding that they did not engage in rohibited solicitation. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the lawyers did engage in solicitation, but their actions were within the litigation excetion to the DPPA."

When McBurney's wife defaulted on child suort obligations, he asked the Virginia Division of Child Suort Enforcement (VDCSE) to file a etition for child suort on his behalf. After a nine-month delay, the etition was filed and granted. He then filed a Virginia Freedom of Information Act (VFOIA) request with the VDCSE for all records ertaining to his son and ex-wife. The VDCSE denied the request, arguing that the information was confidential and McBurney was not a citizen of the state. While McBurney eventually obtained most of needed the information through other sources, he never got all of the information from his VFOIA request.McBurney sued in district court arguing that denial of the VFOIA request violated the rivileges and immunities clause and the dormant commerce clause of the Constitution. The district court ruled against McBurney. Mc Burney along with two others aealed their VFOIA denials to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit, which affirmed the district court. The Court of Aeals held that VFOIA did not hinder a non citizen's right to ursue buisness in the state and did not lace a burden on interstate commerce."
"On October 22, 1998, Calvin O'Neil Jackson was arrested outside of his girlfriend's aartment. His girlfriend, Annette Heathmon, told the olice that Jackson forced his way into her aartment, assaulted her, threatened to kill her with a screwdriver, and raed her. At trial, Heathmon testified that Jackson had reviously sexually and hysically assaulted her but had never been convicted of a crime. The defense attemted to call olice officers to testify that Jackson's girlfriend's revious accusations were unconvincing and unsubstantiated by the evidence. The court barred this testimony and also refused to allow the defense to cross-examine Heathmon regarding alleged rior acts of rostitution. The jury found Jackson guilty of burglary, battery with intent to commit a crime, first degree kidnaing with a deadly weaon, and two counts of sexual assault with a deadly weaon.Jackson aealed his conviction to the Sureme Court of Nevada and argued that the trial court's decision to exclude the evidence of Heathmon's revious accusations violated his right to resent a defense. That court affirmed his conviction and stated that the excluded evidence was neither relevant nor material to his defense. Jackson then filed a emhabeas corusem claim based on the same argument. The district court denied his claim, holding that the state court's exclusion of olice testimony did not violate Jackson's constitutional right to resent a comlete defense. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's decision."
"The Deartment of the Air Force owns a section of land that Highway 1 crosses, and the Deartment has granted roadway easements to the State of California and Santa Barbara County. Highway 1 runs next to the main gate of Vandenberg Air Force Base (Vandenberg). Near the gate is a designated area for ublic rotesting that falls under the Highway 1 easement.John D. Ael was barred from Vandenberg's roerty in 2007 for tresassing. In 2010, while the order barring him was still in effect, he entered the designated rotest area three times and was asked to leave. On all three occasions the resondent failed to leave. In two searate trials, Ael was convicted of three violations of a federal statute rohibiting a erson from reentering a military installation after a commanding officer has ordered him not to reenter. Ael aealed, arguing that the federal statute requires that the base has exclusive ossession over the area. The district court affirmed the convictions by holding that, under the terms of the easement, the land is subject to base rules and regulations. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that, because the area is subject to an easement, the federal government does not have an exclusive right of ossession, so the conviction cannot stand."

The day after the roosition assed, a collection of interest grous and individuals formed the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigration Rights and Fight for Equality by Any Means Necessary (Coalition). The Coalition sued the governor and the regents and boards of trustees of three state universities in district court by arguing that the roosition as it related to ublic education violated the Equal Protection Clause. About a month later, the Michigan Attorney General and Eric Russell, an alicant to the University of Michigan Law School, filed searate motions to intervene as defendants, which were granted.

Under the Michigan Indian Land Claims Settlement Act, lands bought with funds from a congressionally established trust are Indian lands. On November 3, 2010, the Bay Mills Indian Community, a federally recognized Indian tribe with a reservation located in northern Michigan, oened a small casino in the town of Vanderbilt, Michigan, on lands urchased with funds from this trust. The state of Michigan sued for closure of the casino by claiming that the Bay Mills casino violated state gaming laws, as well as various rovisions of its Tribal-State comact.

On June 9, 2011, the resondents jointly removed the case from the Chancery Court of Hinds County to the federal district court and asserted federal jurisdiction was satisfied under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA). Class action and mass action suits can be roerly removed to federal court under the CAFA.The State of Mississii moved to remand the case to state court because the claims in the suit were asserted on behalf of the general ublic, which revented the case from falling under federal jurisdiction.

"In the early 1990s, BG Grou PLC (BG), a British comany, made a major investment in Argentina's natural gas industry. Later, in the midst of an economic crisis, Argentina enacted an emergency law that required investors to collect tariff revenues in Argentinian esos at a rate of one eso er dollar. Given the weak international eso-to-dollar exchange rate, these changes that made it difficult for BG to see a return on its investment. Simultaneously, Argentina adoted legislation that stayed all lawsuits arising from the emergency measures. . BG sought recourse under a bilateral investment treaty (Treaty) between the United Kingdom and Argentina. The Treaty required that BG first attemt to resolve its disute before a """"cometent tribunal"""" in Argentina for at least eighteen months. Instead, BG byassed the Argentinian courts and submitted its disute directly to an arbitral tribunal. The arbitral anel, seated in Washington, D.C., held that Argentina's changes to its judicial system excused the eighteen-month recondition to arbitration and awarded BG over US$185 million in damages. Argentina etitioned the district court to vacate the award under the Federal Arbitration Act by arguing that the arbitral anel exceeded its owers. The court denied the etition. The U.S. Court of Aeals, District of Columbia Circuit reversed and held that the determination of whether BG could submit its disute directly to arbitration must be made by a court, not the arbitral tribunal."

The Green family has organized the business around the rinciles of the Christian faith and has exlicitly exressed the desire to run the comany according to Biblical recets, one of which is the belief that the use of contracetion is immoral. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), emloyment-based grou health care lans must rovide certain tyes of reventative care, such as FDA-aroved contracetive methods. While there are exemtions available for religious emloyers and non-rofit religious institutions, there are no exemtions available for for-rofit institutions such as Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.On Setember 12, 2012, the Greens, as reresentatives of Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., sued Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of the Deartment of Health and Human Services, and challenged the contracetion requirement. The laintiffs argued that the requirement that the emloyment-based grou health care lan cover contracetion violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA). The laintiffs sought a reliminary injunction to revent the enforcement of tax enalties, which the district court denied and a two-judge anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.

When the officers arrived at the location, they observed three men walking along the street, two of whom romtly turned into a nearby aartment comlex while the third crossed the street in front of the olice vehicle. Although he did not see a baseball bat, Stanton considered the behavior of this third man to be susicious and ordered him to sto. The man continued walking into the residence and closed a gate behind him. With the gate closed, Stanton's view was blocked, and believing that the man had committed a jailable offense by refusing to sto, he decided to forcibly oen the gate. Unbeknownst to Stanton, the residence's owner, Drendolyn Sims was standing behind the gate and was injured when Stanton oened it.Sims sued Stanton in federal district court and argued that he had unreasonably searched her home without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The district court granted summary judgment to Stanton and held that Stanton's entry was justified by the otential danger of the situation, Sims had a lesser exectation of rivacy in the curtilage—surrounding area—of her home, and Stanton was entitled to qualified immunity. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that Stanton's actions were unconstitutional because Sims was entitled to the same exectation of rivacy in the curtilage of her home as she was in her home itself. The Court of Aeals also held that Stanton's warrantless entry was not justified because the man was only susected of a misdemeanor and that Stanton was not entitled to qualified immunity."

On aeal, the defendant argued that the trial court imroerly denied his motion to suress. The California Court of Aeal for the Second District affirmed and held that the warrantless search was lawful because a co-tenant consented."
"In 2006 Gina Fiore and Keith Gison traveled from Las Vegas, Nevada to Atlantic City, New Jersey, to San Juan, Puerto Rico before returning to Las Vegas by way of Atlanta, Georgia. The two are rofessional gamblers with residences in California and Las Vegas. At a Transortation Security Administration (TSA) checkoint in San Juan, Fiore and Gison were subjected to heightened security because they were travelling on a one-way ticket. TSA officers search the gamblers luggage and found $97,000 in U.S. currency. San Juan Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officers arrived and questioned the air to determine whether the money was the roceeds of illegal drug trade. Fiore and Gison stated that the cash was their seed money and winnings from gambling. The DEA let Fiore and Gison board the lane to Atlanta with their luggage.When Fiore and Gison landed at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airort, Anthony Walden and other DEA agents aroached and questioned them. Fiore and Gison reeated their story and roduced records of their travels. When a drug-detecting dog awed Gison's bag once, Walden stated that he had robable cause to seize the cash and took both Fiore and Gison's bags before allowing them to continue on to Las Vegas without the money. When Fiore and Gison got to Las Vegas they sent records of their gambling earnings along with ast tax returns to rove their status as rofessional gamblers to Walden. Walden refused to return the money and referred the matter to a U.S. Attorney in Georgia based on a false robable cause affidavit. The U.S. Attorney found no robable cause and ordered the money returned. The money was returned to Fiore and Gison seven months after it was seized.Fiore and Gison sued Walden in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada alleging that the seizure violated their Fourth Amendment rights. Walden moved to dismiss for lack of ersonal jurisdiction, and the District Court granted the motion. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the court did have ersonal jurisdiction because Walden intentionally caused foreseeable harm in Nevada by falsifying the robable cause affidavit and attemting to secure the seized funds ermanently for the Atlanta DEA."
"In October 2001, Quality Stores -- a national comany -- and its affiliates commenced bankrutcy roceedings. When laying off emloyees, Quality Stores issued severance ay as art of its emloyees' gross income and reorted the ayments for federal income tax uroses as """"wages"""" on W-2 forms. As required for """"wages"""", the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax was aid on severance ayments. FICA is a tax imosed on wages earned to fund Social Security and Medicare; both emloyer and emloyee ay art of the tax. The emloyee's art is withheld from his aycheck. Quality Stores contends that severance ay does not qualify as """"wages"""", but rather ayments under a Sulemental Unemloyment Benefit (SUB) lan that are not taxable under FICA. SUB is a cororate rogram that creates severance ayments in the event of involuntary termination; SUB ayments do not qualify as """"wages"""" under FICA because they are given after termination of a job rather than for work comleted.Based on this line of reasoning, Quality Stores filed for a refund from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS did not resond to Quality Stores' request for a refund, neither by allowing the claim nor denying it, and Quality Stores sued the IRS. The federal district court agreed with Quality Stores' view on severance ayments. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court and held that severance ay satisfies the elements Congress set out to determine SUB ayments, which therefore makes such ayments exemt from FICA taxes."
"In November 2009, Bruce Abramski learned that his uncle wanted to urchase a new 9mm Glock handgun. Abramski offered to urchase this weaon because, as a former Virginia olice officer, he could get a discount. On November 17, Abramski urchased the handgun and comleted a form distributed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Exlosives (""""ATF"""") on which he checked a box indicating that he was not buying the gun on behalf of another erson.In June 2010, Abramski was arrested for susicion of committing a bank robbery. During a search of his home, the olice found a receit showing that Abramski gave the handgun to his uncle in exchange for $400. The olice charged Abramski with violating federal law by making a false, material statement on an ATF form and with resect to information ket by a licensed firearms dealer. Secifically, the government argued that Abramski knowingly made a false statement to a firearms dealer, that he intended to deceive the firearms dealer, and that he made the false statement about a """"material fact"""" when he did not disclose that he was buying the firearm for his uncle. A grand jury subsequently indicted Abramski.Abramski moved to dismiss the indictment and suress evidence regarding the receit. He argued that he legally transferred the firearm to his uncle and therefore never made any false statements to the ATF or the firearms dealer. He also argued that the olice violated his Fourth Amendment rights because they did not have a roer warrant to conduct the search of his home from which the receit resulted. The trial court denied Abramski's motion, stating that, because he did not disclose that the firearm was meant for his uncle, Abramski withheld a """"material fact"""" required when urchasing a firearm. The trial court also held that the olice did not violate Abramski's Fourth Amendment rights. Abramski entered a conditional guilty lea and received five years of robation and a $200 fine. The United States Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed."
"John Dudenhoeffer and Alireza Partivoanah are former emloyees of Fifth Third Bank and are articiants in the Fifth Third Bancor Master Profit Sharing Plan, an emloyee stock ownershi lan (ESOP), which is a defined contribution retirement fund for emloyees with Fifth Third as a trustee. Particiants make voluntary contributions to the ESOP from their salaries and Fifth Third matches the contributions by urchasing Fifth Third stock for their individual accounts. During the time eriod in question, a large amount of the ESOP's assets were invested in Fifth Third stock. Also during this eriod, Fifth Third switched from being a conservative lender to a subrime lender and the ortfolio became increasingly vulnerable to risk, which it failed to disclose. The rice of the stock declined drastically and caused the ESOP to lose tens of millions of dollars. The resondents sued Fifth Third and argued that Fifth Third breached its fiduciary duty as imosed by the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by continuing to invest in Fifth Third stock desite having knowledge of its increasingly recarious value. The federal district court granted Fifth Third's motion to dismiss and held that the laintiffs failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted because under ERISA, the investment decisions made by ESOP fiduciaries are resumed to be rudent. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that, while ESOP fiduciaries have a resumtion of rudence, this resumtion was an evidentiary matter and thus not grounds for a motion to dismiss."
"On January 19, 2005, Scott D. Cheever shot and killed Greenwood County Sheriff Matthew Samuels at the residence of Darrell and Belinda Cooers in Hillto, Kansas. Samuels had gone to the Cooers' residence based on a ti to arrest Cheever for outstanding warrants. He found the Cooers, Cheever, and two others cooking and ingesting methamhetamines. In the following attemts to arrest Cheever and retrieve the injured Samuels, Cheever also shot at several other officers.At trial, Cheever asserted a voluntary intoxication defense and argued that the methamhetamine use rendered him mentally incaable of the remeditation required for murder. During the course of the trial, the judge ordered Cheever to undergo a sychiatric examination conducted by a sychiatric hired by the government. The rosecution sought to bring the transcrit of the interview into evidence to imeach Cheever's testimony regarding the order of events at the Cooers' residence, which the court allowed. After the defense rested their case, the rosecution called the sychiatrist to the stand as a rebuttal witness to resond to the defense's claims regarding Cheever's mental caacity at the time of the crime. The trial court allowed the sychiatrist's testimony as a rebuttal witness. The jury found Cheever guilty and, at a searate sentencing hearing, sentenced him to death. The Kansas Sureme Court held that the admission of the government sychiatrist's testimony into evidence violated Cheever's Fifth Amendment rights."
"Kevin Loughrin created a scheme to obtain cash by stealing checks from eole's outgoing mail, altering them to make urchases at Target, and returning the urchases for cash. When the scheme came to an end, he and Theresa Thongsarn were indicted on six counts of bank fraud, two counts of aggravated identity theft, and one count of ossession of stolen mail. Loughrin moved to dismiss the case and alleged violations of the Seedy Trial Act; the district court denied the motion to dismiss. At trial, Loughrin requested that the jury instructions secify that the jury had to find that he had the intent to defraud a financial institution in order to find him guilty of bank fraud. The district court held that such an instruction was not necessary and declined to use it. Loughrin was convicted on all counts and sentenced to 36 months in rison. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed."
"In 2007, the Massachusetts state legislature created a 35-foot buffer zone around the entrances, exits, and driveways of abortion clinics. The etitioners, individuals who routinely engage in """"ro-life counseling"""" outside of state abortion clinics, sued in federal district court and argued that the law violated the First Amendment rotection of free seech. The district court held that, although the law laced a restriction on the time, lace, and manner of seech, the law was constitutional because it was content-neutral and still left adequate, if not erfect, alternative means of communications. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit affirmed and held that the Sureme Court, in em Hill v. Colorado em had already affirmed a similar statute in Colorado that rohibited certain activities within 100 feet of abortion clinics."
"In January 2010, Srint Communications Co. filed a comlaint with the Iowa Utilities Board (""""IUB"""") asking for a declaration that it was roer to withhold certain VoIP call access charges from Windstream (formerly Iowa Telecom). Before IUB addressed the comlaint, Srint settled the disute with Windstream and withdrew its comlaint. However, IUB continued the roceeding so that it could decide a greater underlying issue of how VoIP communications should be classified under federal law. In February 2011, IUB issued an order with its own interretation of VoIP's classification under federal law along with a determination that Srint was liable to Windstream for the access charges.Srint challenged IUB's order by filing a comlaint in both state court and federal district court, alleging that federal law reemts the IUB's decision. In order to roceed with the federal comlaint first, Srint filed a motion to stay the state case until resolution of the federal case. In turn, the IUB filed a motion asking the federal court to abstain and dismiss the case under the doctrine of emYounger v. Harrisem. Generally, this doctrine states that a federal court shall abstain from hearing a case if there is a threat of interference with a state court roceeding involving imortant state interests. The district court granted IUB's motion and dismissed Srint's federal comlaint. Srint aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit, which uheld the district court's abstention, but determined that a stay on the federal roceedings was more aroriate than dismissal."
"ICON Health &am; Fitness, Inc. (ICON) manufactures and sells exercise equiment throughout the United States. In 2000, ICON obtained U.S. Patent No. 6,019,710 (the '710 atent) for a system designed to link arts in ellitical exercise machines. In 2010, ICON filed a comlaint against another manufacturer and seller of exercise equiment, Octane Fitness (Octane), and claimed that Octane's ellitical design infringed uon the '710 atent.The federal district court held that Octane's design did not violate ICON's '710 atent. ICON aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeal for the Federal Circuit. Octane argued that ICON's lawsuit was not based on any real atent infringement, but instead aimed at hamering ustart cometitors with exensive, frivolous lawsuits. Therefore, Octane asked the court to aly a atent law attorney fees statute, a statute that awards attorney fees when the laintiff's suit is found to be """"excetional."""" The aellate court affirmed the lower court's decision, but found that ICON had not acted """"excetionally"""" under the statute."
"Lexmark International, Inc. (Lexmark) is a large roducer of rinters and toner cartridges. In 2002, Lexmark sued Static Control Comonents, Inc. (SCC) and alleged that SCC violated Lexmark's intellectual roerty when it manufactured microchis used in the reair and resale of Lexmark toner cartridges. SCC filed a counterclaim and argued that Lexmark, among other things, violated the Lantham Act by engaging in false advertising. The district court dismissed SCC's Lantham Act claims for lack of standing. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the ruling and held that the lower court emloyed the wrong test to establish standing.The Sixth Circuit relied on the """"reasonable interest"""" test to establish standing under the Lantham Act, but unlike its sister circuits, did not use the AGC Factors, which use the same standards as those to establish an antitrust claim. Under this test, a claimant must demonstrate 1) a reasonable interest against the alleged false advertising and 2) a reasonable basis for believing that the alleged false advertising will damage that interest."
"Pamela J. Harris is a ersonal care assistant who rovides in-home care to disabled articiants in the Home Services Program administered by a division of the Illinois Deartment of Human Services (Disabilities Program). The state ays the wages of assistants who work with articiants in either the Disabilities Program or a rogram run by the Division of Rehabilitation Services (Rehabilitation Program). In 2003, a majority of the Rehabilitation Program ersonal assistants elected Service Emloyees International Union Healthcare Illinois &am; Indiana as their collective bargaining reresentative. The union and the state negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that included a """"fair share"""" rovision, which required all ersonal assistants who are not union members to ay a roortionate share of the costs of the collective bargaining rocess and contract administration. The Disabilities Program assistants rejected union membershi in 2009.In 2010, Harris and other ersonal assistants from both rograms sued Governor Pat Quinn and the unions and claimed that the fair share fees violated their freedom of seech and freedom of association rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court dismissed the laintiffs' claims. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. The aellate court held that the state may require its emloyees, including ersonal assistants such as the laintiffs, to ay fair share fees and further held that the claims of the Disability Program were not rie for judicial review."
"After Jake LaMotta retired from boxing, he and Frank Peter Petrella (F. Petrella) created two screenlays and a book based on LaMotta's life. These works were registered with the United States Coyright Office in 1963, 1973, and 1970, resectively. In 1976, LaMotta and F. Petrella signed a written agreement that granted the exclusive rights to the book and the screenlays to Chartoff-Winkler Productions, Inc, which in turn assigned those rights to a subsidiary of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. (MGM), United Artists Cororation. In 1980, United Artists Cororation registered a coyright for the film """"Raging Bull"""" based on LaMotta and F. Petrella's work. When F. Petrella died in 1981, which was still within the original 28-year eriod of the coyright, his renewal rights assed to his heirs.In 1991, Paula Petrella (Petrella), the daughter of F. Petrella, filed an alication for the renewal of coyright rights on the 1963 screenlay. In 1998, Petrella's attorney contacted MGM and asserted that Petrella had obtained the rights to the screenlay and its derivative works, which included the movie """"Raging Bull,"""" and that MGM was infringing on those rights. MGM argued that the 1963 screenlay was a collaboration between LaMotta and F. Petrella, so MGM retained the rights to the screenlay under the agreement with LaMotta. MGM also argued that there was no """"substantial similarity of rotectable elements"""" between the 1963 screenlay and the film. In 2009, Petrella sued MGM for coyright infringement, and the federal district court granted summary judgment for MGM under the doctrine of laches, which revents a legal claim from being enforced if a long delay in filing the claim adversely affected the defendant's ability to fight the claim. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"Section 125 of the Aviation Transortation Safety Act (ATSA) states that an air carrier who voluntarily reorts susicious transactions or behavior shall not be """"civilly liable."""" The immunity does not aly to disclosures made with """"actual knowledge"""" that the disclosure is false, inaccurate, or misleading. Likewise, the immunity does not extend to an air carrier that makes a disclosure with """"reckless disregard"""" as to its truth or falsity.William Hoeer, a ilot for Air Wisconsin, made four unsuccessful attemts to become certified to fly another tye of aircraft after Air Wisconsin discontinued use of the tye of lane that Hoeer had reviously iloted. During his fourth and final oortunity to ass the test, Hoeer abrutly ended the test because he believed that the test administrators were deliberately sabotaging his efforts to ass. One test administrator knew that the Transortation Security Administration (TSA) had issued a firearm to Hoeer in his role as a federal flight deck officer (FFDO). FFDO ilots are not allowed to carry the firearm while traveling as assengers. This administrator booked Hoeer on a flight from the testing center in Virginia to Hoeer's home in Denver and then called the TSA to reort that Hoeer was a disgruntled, and ossibly armed, emloyee. In resonse, TSA officials arrested and searched Hoeer.Hoeer sued Air Wisconsin in a Colorado state court and alleged defamation under Virginia law. Air Wisconsin moved for a directed verdict based on the argument that it was immune from civil liability under ATSA. Air Wisconsin also argued that Hoeer could not rove """"actual malice"""" because its statements were """"substantially true"""" and therefore rotected by the Free Seech Clause of the First Amendment. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. The jury found that Air Wisconsin's statements to the TSA were false and that it made at least one statement with reckless disregard for the truth, so the jury awarded Hoeer damages. A Colorado aellate court affirmed the verdict. The Colorado Sureme Court held that the trial court's submission of the matter to the jury was imroer; however, the error was harmless in this case because Air Wisconsin was not entitled to claim immunity under ATSA. The Colorado Sureme Court further held that substantial evidence suorted the jury's finding that the statements were false."
"During the 2004 residential camaign, President George W. Bush's team scheduled a camaign sto in Jacksonville, Oregon. With the aroval of local law enforcement agencies, oonents of President Bush organized a eaceful demonstration to rotest his olicies. The demonstration took lace at a ublic ark before moving to the street near the local inn where the President was staying. Eventually, both oonents and suorters of President Bush gathered on the street of near the entrance to the inn, and each grou had equal access to deliver its message to the President at the time of his arrival. Before the President arrived, Secret Service agents ordered local olice to ush rotestors away from the immediate area for security reasons. The agents then ordered that the rotesters be driven farther away from the inn onto the east side of 5th street. However, agents failed to give the same directive for suorters who remained stationed on the streets close to the inn. The laintiffs alleged that the orders to move were unintelligibly given and that olice roceeded to use force before confirming that the orders were understood or were being followed."
"In August 2000, Vonlee Nicole Titlow heled his aunt Billie Rogers murder his wealthy uncle Donald Rogers. After Titlow was charged with first-degree murder, the rosecution offered him a lea bargain. In exchange for testifying against Billie Rogers, Titlow could lead guilty to manslaughter and receive a reduced sentence. After consulting with his attorney, Titlow acceted the deal. However, before sentencing, Titlow soke to a sheriff's deuty who suggested that he withdraw his guilty lea and consult another attorney. Titlow followed the deuty's advice, hired a new attorney and withdrew his guilty lea.Following his trial, a jury convicted Titlow of second-degree murder and sentenced him to 20-to-40 years in rison. This led Titlow to accuse his second attorney of ineffective assistance of counsel for allowing him to withdraw the original guilty lea. Both the trial court and the Michigan Court of Aeals rejected Titlow's claim. Titlow etitioned the Michigan Sureme Court to hear his case, but they refused to do so.Titlow then etitioned for federal habeas corus relief, but the district court denied his claim as well. The district court held that Titlow failed to meet the standard for overturning a state-court conviction under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (""""AEDPA""""). The Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the lower court's decision and ordered the state to reoffer Titlow's original lea agreement. The aellate court held that Titlow's second attorney was ineffective for failing to investigate his claims further, failing to obtain documents from the first attorney, and failing to convince Titlow to take the lea bargain."

Mirowski Family Ventures (MFV) held both atents and licensed them to Guidant Cor. In 1991, Medtronic, a manufacturer of medical devices and equiment, entered into a sublicense agreement with Eli Lilly &am; Co., Guidant Cor's redecessor-in-interest regarding these atents. The agreement obligated MFV to inform Medtronic which items were covered by which atents, and if Medtronic disagreed, Medtronic could retain atent rights and file for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement on the atents. In October and November of 2007, MFV identified several Medtronic roducts that it believed infringed on its atents, and Medtronic subsequently sued for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement.In the bench trial in district court, the court, relying on recedent, stated that the atent holder bears the burden of roving that infringement occurred and found in favor of Medtronic. MFV aealed and argued that the burden falls on the alleged atent infringer to rove that infringement did not occur. The United States Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit held that, because Medtronic is the arty seeking relief from the court, it bears the burden to rove that it did not infringe on MFV's atents."

The subcontract agreement contained a forum selection clause stating that any disute would be litigated in Circuit Court for the City of Norfolk, Virginia, or the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division. Desite this clause, J-Crew brought suit against Atlantic in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas for failure to ay for work J-Crew erformed.Atlantic moved to dismiss the suit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) and 28 U.S.C. §1406, arguing that the forum selection clause required the suit to be brought in Virginia. Atlantic also moved, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the Eastern District of Virginia under 28 U.S.C. §1404(a). The district court denied Atlantic's motions, holding that Atlantic did not show why the interest of justice or the convenience of the arties weighed in favor of Virginia. Atlantic etitioned the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit for a writ of mandamus ordering the district court to dismiss the case or transfer it to Virginia. The court of aeals held that the district court did not abuse its discretion and venue was roer in the Texas court because the arties entered into and erformed the agreement in that district."
"Harvey N. Levin was hired as an Illinois Assistant District Attorney on Setember 5, 2000. On May 12, 2006 when he was fired, Levin was over the age of sixty, and he believed that he was fired due to his age and gender. He was relaced by a female attorney in her thirties. Levin sued the state of Illinois, the Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan in both her individual and official caacities, and four other Attorney General emloyees under the Age Discrimination Emloyment Act (ADEA), the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The defendants moved to dismiss the suit by arguing that either the claim under the ADEA recluded the Civil Rights Act claim or that they were entitled to qualified immunity under the ADEA. The district court originally ruled that the ADEA did not revent the claim from roceeding under the Civil Rights Act and granted the qualified immunity. After the case was reassigned to a different district court judge, the district court held that Levin was not an emloyee for the urose of the Civil Rights Act and the ADEA, so he could not ursue those claims, and that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed."
"On January 25, 1997, a sixteen-year-old girl was kidnaed, murdered, and raed. After an investigation, the olice arrested Robert Woodall, who subsequently led guilty to caital murder, caital kidnaing, and first-degree rae. At trial, Woodall invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination and declined to testify, and so he asked the judge to instruct the jury not to make any adverse inferences from that decision. The judge refused to issue the """"no adverse inference"""" instruction and stated that, by entering a guilty lea, Woodall waived his right to be free from self-incrimination. The jury found Woodall guilty on all charges and the judge sentenced him to the death enalty and two subsequent life sentences.Woodall aealed to the Kentucky Sureme Court, which affirmed both Woodall's conviction and sentence. In 2006, Woodall filed a emhabeus corusem etition in federal court, and that court held that the trial court violated Woodall's Fifth Amendment right when it refused to offer the requested jury instruction. In addition, that court also held that Woodall's Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated when the trial court allowed the state to dismiss an African-American juror without a mandatory hearing for cause. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision on the issue of self-incrimination but did not address the other issues."
"In 1995, Congress enacted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), which was meant to combat issues such as nuisance filings, targeting of secific clients, and client maniulation in class action suits. To revent laintiffs from filing class action suits in state courts in order to get around the restrictions of PSLRA, Congress enacted the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act (SLUSA), which rovided for the dismissal or removal of a class action suit brought by more than 50 laintiffs in connection with a """"covered security."""" The term """"covered security"""" was limited to a subset of securities that were traded on a national exchange or issued by a federally registered investment comany.In 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the Stanford Grou Comany and other holdings of R. Allen Stanford for allegedly eretrating a massive Ponzi scheme. Two grous of Louisiana investors also sued Stanford holdings for their roles in the Ponzi scheme and for violations of the Louisiana Securities Act. These cases were consolidated with two others against Stanford holdings and moved to the district court for the Northern District of Texas. The defendants moved to dismiss the comlaints under SLUSA and argued that the court should adot an exansive interretation of """"covered securities."""" The district court held that the funds were not covered securities, but it granted the dismissal because the funds were reresented as covered securities and because it was likely that at least one of the laintiffs liquidated a retirement account, which a covered security, in order to urchase the funds in question. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and held that there was not a sufficient connection between the misreresentation and the stock sale to consider them connected and for the securities to function as """"covered"""" for the uroses of a SLUSA dismissal."
"The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) established the National Labor Relations Board (Board) to decide labor disutes among emloyers, unions, and emloyees. Parties first file unfair labor ractice allegations to a Regional Office, which then conducts an investigation and, if necessary, files a comlaint. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) resides over the hearing on the comlaint and issues a recommendation to the Board. Unless a arty to the disute files a timely aeal, the ALJ's recommendation becomes the final order of the Board. To hear a case and issue a ruling, the Board must have at least three of its five members resent. The NLRA allows arties to aeal a Board ruling to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the area where the alleged unfair labor ractice occurred or to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Board members are aointed by the resident and serve five-year terms.In 2010, Noel Canning, a bottler and distributor of Pesi-Cola roducts, was engaged in negotiations with its emloyee union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 760 (Union). During the final bargaining session that December, Noel Canning agreed to submit two wage and ension lans to a vote by the Union membershi. The membershi aroved the union's referred roosal. However, Noel Canning argued that the discussions did not amount to a binding agreement and refused to incororate the changes into a new collective bargaining agreement. The Union filed a comlaint with the Board alleging that Noel Canning's actions constituted an unfair labor ractice in violation of the NLRA. An ALJ determined that the agreement was binding and ordered Noel Canning to sign the collective bargaining agreement. The Board affirmed the ruling against Noel Canning.Noel Canning aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which held that the Board's ruling was invalid because not enough members of the Board were resent. The anel that heard the Noel Canning case consisted of one member who was aointed by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2010 and two members whom President Obama aointed without Senate confirmation in January 2012. Although the Recess Aointments Clause allows the resident to fill vacancies that occur while Congress is in recess, between December 2011 and the end of January 2012, the Senate met in ro forma meetings every three business days. Therefore, the Court of Aeals determined that the Senate was not in recess on the days the Senate did not meet because, for the urose of the Recess Aointments Clause, recess is defined as the time in between sessions of Congress."
"Bellingham Insurance Agency, Inc. (BIA) was a comany owned by Nicholas Paleveda and his wife, Marjorie Ewing. Shortly before BIA filed for voluntary Chater 7 bankrutcy in 2006, the comany assigned the insurance commission from one of its largest clients to Peter Pearce, a long-time emloyee. Additionally, Paleveda used BIA funds to incororate the Executive Benefits Insurance Agency, Inc. (EBIA). Pearce then deosited over $100,000 into an account held jointly by EBIA and another comany owned by Paleveda and Ewing. The Trustee, Peter Arkison, filed a claim against EBIA in the BIA bankrutcy roceeding. Arkison alleged fraudulent conveyances and that EBIA, as a successor cororation, was liable for BIA's debts. The bankrutcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the Trustee and the district court affirmed.On aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, EBIA argued, for the first time, that the bankrutcy judge's entry of a final judgment on the Trustee's claims was unconstitutional. The Court of Aeals affirmed the district court's decision. It held that, while a bankrutcy court may not decide a fraudulent conveyance claim, it may hear the claim and make a recommendation for review by a district court. Additionally, the Court of Aeals determined that EBIA, by failing to object to the bankrutcy court's jurisdiction, waived its Seventh Amendment right to a hearing before an Article III court."

The olice officers were ordered to continue the ursuit across the border and ultimately surrounded Rickard in a arking lot in Memhis, Tennessee. When Rickard again attemted to flee, the olice fired shots into the vehicle, ultimately killing both Rickard and Kelley Allen, a woman who had been a assenger in the vehicle. The entire exchange was catured on olice video.Rickard and Allen's families sued the olice officers, the chief of olice, and the mayor of West Memhis under federal and state law claims. The families argued that the olice used excessive force when ursuing and ultimately killing Rickard and Allen and that using that force violated the Fourth Amendment. They also brought claims of assault, battery, malicious rosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress, false imrisonment, and abuse of rocess. The government argued that, because the olice acted in their official caacity, they were entitled to either absolute or qualified immunity from any lawsuit. The district court refused to dismiss the case against the government, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the decision of the trial court. The Court of Aeals held that qualified immunity only alies when officers are acting reasonably, and after reviewing subsequent cases, held that the olice did not act reasonably in this case. Additionally, because the video evidence showed that the olice fired on unarmed, fleeing drivers, a jury could determine that the olice were not acting reasonably."
"In 1999, Gary Woods and Billy McCombs became investors in two artnershis. Those artnershis then transferred their assets to a cororation that was jointly owned by Woods and McCombs, which caused the artnershis to be considered liquidated for tax uroses. Because the value of a liquidated asset is equal to the artner's basis in the investment, the artnershis reorted their losses on their tax reorts as equal to the urchased otions Woods' and McCombs' searate comanies originally contributed to the artnershis. After conducting an audit, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined that the artnershi transactions served no business urose and were solely for the urose of tax avoidance. Therefore they had no legal basis and the IRS did not consider the artnershis valid. The IRS imosed accuracy-related enalties for understatements of income and gross valuation misstatements.In 2005, Woods (as the tax matters reresentative for the artnershi) brought the matter before a district court and argued that enalties were inaroriate because the tax consequences of the transactions were accurately reorted. The district court held that the transactions """"lacked economic substance"""" and that their reorted losses should be disregarded. The court also held that, because the transactions had no economic substance, the valuation misstatement enalties did not aly. The United States aealed the decision with regard to the valuation misstatement enalties, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court's ruling."
"On August 23, 2004, Unite Here Local 355 (UHL) entered an agreement with Mardi Gras Gaming (Mardi Gras), the owner of a casino and dog track in Florida. Under the terms of the agreement, UHL would ay for advertisements to suort a gambling ballot initiative that Mardi Gras wanted to ass, and Mardi Gras would facilitate the union organizing Mardi Gras' workers by roviding the union with access to work remises, emloyee information, and neutrality toward the unionization of their emloyees. UHL also agreed not to strike, rotest, icket or otherwise ressure the comany's business.Martin Mulhall, a Mardi Gras emloyee, sued both Mardi Gras, and UHL. He oosed the agreement and argued that it violates the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), which rohibits an emloyer giving or a union receiving a """"thing of value."""" The district court dismissed the lawsuit for lack of standing, holding that Mulhall was not injured by UHL merely seeking to reresent him. Mulhall aealed. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed and remanded. On remand, the district court dismissed the comlaint for failure to state a claim. Mulhall aealed again and the Court of Aeals again reversed and remanded."
"In 2005, a grand jury began investigating Kerri Kaley and her husband Brian Kaley for stealing rescrition medical devices from hositals. In February 2007, the grand jury indicted the Kaleys on seven criminal counts. One of these counts was a criminal forfeiture count, which would require the Kaleys to forfeit all roerty that could be traced to their offenses. This roerty included a certificate of deosit for $500,000, which the Kaleys intended to use to ay their defense attorneys.Following the indictment, the district court issued a rotective order reventing the Kaleys from transferring or disosing of any roerty in the forfeiture count. The Kaleys moved to vacate the order because it revented them from hiring their attorneys in violation of their right to counsel rotected by the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The district court denied their motion without granting a retrial evidentiary hearing. The Kaleys aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which reversed and remanded.On remand, the district court granted a retrial hearing, but limited it to the question of whether the roerty in the forfeiture count was traceable to the Kaleys' offenses. When the Kaleys failed to resent evidence regarding traceability, the district court refused to vacate the rotective order. The Kaleys aealed again, arguing that they should have been allowed to challenge the validity of the indictment in the retrial hearing. The aellate court disagreed and affirmed the lower court's decision."
"The town of Greece, New York, is governed by a five-member town board that conducts official business at monthly ublic meetings. Starting in 1999, the town meetings began with a rayer given by an invited member of the local clergy. The town did not adot any olicy regarding who may lead the rayer or its content, but in ractice, Christian clergy members delivered the vast majority of the rayers at the town's invitation. In 2007, Susan Galloway and Linda Stehens comlained about the town's rayer ractices, after which there was some increase in the denominations reresented.In February 2008, Galloway and Stehens sued the town and John Auberger, in his official caacity as Town Suervisor, and argued that the town's ractices violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by referring Christianity over other faiths. The district court found in favor of the town and held that the laintiffs failed to resent credible evidence that there was intentional seclusion of non-Christian faiths. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed and held that the ractices violated the Establishment Clause by showing a clear reference for Christian rayers."
"In 2002, Congress assed the Biartisan Camaign Reform Act (BCRA), which established two sets of limits to camaign contributions. The base limit laced restrictions on how much money a contributor—defined broadly as individuals, artnershis, and other organizations—may give to secified categories of reciients. The aggregate limit restricted how much money an individual may donate in a two-year election cycle. The limits were eriodically recalibrated to factor in inflation.Shaun McCutcheon is an Alabama resident who is eligible to vote. In the 2011-2012 election cycle, he donated to the Reublican National Committee, other Reublican committees, as well as individual candidates. He wished to donate more in amounts that would be ermissible under the base limit but would violate the aggregate limit. McCutcheon and the other laintiffs sued the Federal Election Commission, arguing that the aggregate limit violated the First Amendment by failing to serve a """"cognizable government interest"""" and being rohibitively low. The district court held that the aggregate limit served government interests by reventing corrution or the aearance of corrution and was set at a reasonable limit."
"In 2011, the Oklahoma state legislature assed a bill that restricts the use of abortion-inducing drugs to the uses described on their Federal Drug Administration (FDA) labels. The law criminalizes the use of these drugs in alternative combinations, known as """"off-label uses,"""" that have been found to roduce safer, less costly abortions. Before the law took effect, the Oklahoma Coalition for Reroductive Justice and Nova Health Systems sued the state in state district court and sought an injunction to rohibit enforcement of the law. They argued that the law effectively banned abortions in violation of both the state and federal constitutions. The state district court held the law unconstitutional and the state officials aealed to the Oklahoma Sureme Court. The Oklahoma Sureme Court held that the state law conflicted with Sureme Court rulings that rotected a woman's right to seek an abortion and was therefore unconstitutional."
"The Gardens is a low-income neighborhood in the Townshi of Mount Holly, New Jersey. African American and Hisanic residents made u most of the occuants of the neighborhood's 329 homes. Problems relating to crowding, vacant roerties, and crime have long lagued the Gardens. Shortly after designating the area """"in need of develoment"""" in 2000, the Townshi began acquiring roerties and instituted a series of redeveloment lans over the next several years. Each lan called for the demolition of most, if not all, of the original homes in the neighborhood and the construction of new, more exensive homes in their lace. The number and tye of affordable-housing units available to existing Gardens residents varied in each lan.In 2003, Citizens in Action sued the Townshi in state court and alleged violations of New Jersey redeveloment and antidiscrimination laws. The court dismissed some of their claims and granted summary judgment in favor of the Townshi on other claims. Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action and a number of current and former Gardens residents sued in federal court in 2008 and argued that the Townshi's actions violated the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and other federal antidiscrimination laws. The FHA makes it unlawful to """"refuse to sell or rent . . . or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any erson because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin."""" The court granted summary judgment in favor of the Townshi by ruling that the laintiffs had failed to show that the lans had a racially disarate imact under the FHA. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed and held that the laintiffs had indeed resented a rima facie case of discrimination and that material questions of fact relating to less discriminatory alternatives available to the Townshi remained oen."
"The Patent Act allows a court to award reasonable attorneys fees in excetional cases in which the lawsuit is objectively baseless and brought in bad faith. Allcare Management Systems, Inc. (Allcare) owns a atent that covers a comuter-based method of generating treatment otions based on symtom data entered by a hysician. This rocess can hel an insurance comany determine whether to arove a articular treatment for a atient. In 2003, Highmark, Inc. (Highmark), a health insurance comany, sought a declaratory judgment of non-infringement of Allcare's atent. Allcare filed a counterclaim and alleged that Highmark infringed on two sections of its atent. The federal district court awarded summary judgment in favor of Highmark. The court also found that Allcare had willfully ursued frivolous infringement claims and ordered it to ay Highmark's attorney's fees and costs. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit indeendently reviewed the district court's determination that Allcare's claims were objectively baseless. The aellate court affirmed the lower court's finding with resect to one of Allcare's claims and reversed the court regarding Allcare's second claim."
"In 2001, James Alvin Castleman was charged and leaded guilty to one count of misdemeanor domestic assault under the relevant Tennessee statute, which dealt with knowingly or intentionally causing bodily harm to the mother of the defendant's child. Seven years later, federal agents discovered that Castleman and his wife were buying firearms from dealers and selling them on the black market. Because Castleman's domestic assault conviction rohibited him from urchasing firearms, Castleman's wife bought the weaons in her own name. Castleman was indicted in federal district court and charged with two counts of ossessing a firearm after being convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. The district court dismissed the charges and held that Castleman's misdemeanor domestic assault conviction under Tennessee law did not constitute the misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as required by the federal statute. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed."
"In 1908, the United States granted land, known as a right-of-way (ROW) to the Hahn's Peak and Pacific Railway Comany to build a 66-mile railway from Laramie, Wyoming to Colorado. In 1976, the United States granted Fox Park, Wyoming⎯land that surrounds the ROW⎯to Melvin and Lula Brandt. In 1986, a new comany, the Wyoming and Colorado Railway Comany, acquired the ROW. The comany oerated the ROW until it officially abandoned the land in 2003. Following the abandonment, the United States sued the Brandt Revocable Trust and other otential roerty owners under 42 USC 912, a statute governing the disosition of abandoned or forfeited railroad grants. The government argued that this statute reverts abandoned ROWs back to the federal government's exclusive ossession. The United States sought a judicial order of abandonment and exclusive ossession of the ROW. The Brandt Revocable Trust and roerty owners filed a countersuit seeking full ossession of the ROW, insofar as it cut through their land. They argued that the statute only granted an easement to the United States, not full ossession. The district court granted the interest in the ROW to the United States and the US. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed."
"In 2001, the United States Forest Service (""""Forest Service"""") roduced a study into the aquatic and river systems in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. As a result of this study, the Forest Service issued a Final Environmental Imact Statement that set new standards designed to rotect and reair the aquatic and river systems in that area. In 2004, the Forest Service amended these standards and recommended considerable changes to other existing rograms.Following this change, the Pacific Rivers Council filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, alleging that the changes to the Environmental Imact Statement violated rovisions of the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Forest Service. The Pacific Rivers Council aealed.The Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in art and reversed in art. First, that court held that the amended 2004 Environmental Imact Statement failed to adequately account for the secific environmental imacts that the standards may have on fish in the Sierra Nevada. This lack of analysis violated the NEPA and the APA. The 2004 statement did, however, adequately analyze the effect that the new standards may have on amhibians. Therefore, the new standards with resect to amhibians did not violate either the NEPA or the APA. The Forest Service aealed."
"In August 2007, Justus Rosemond and Ronald Joseh met Ricardo Gonzalez in a Tooele, Utah, ark to sell him a ound of marijuana. When Gonzalez attemted to take the marijuana without aying, he was fired uon while fleeing. The government charged Justus Rosemond with several drug-and firearm-related offenses. At trial, the government alleged that Rosemond was either the shooter or that he aided and abetted the shooter. The jury convicted Rosemond on all charges.On aeal, Rosemond argued that the trial court's instructions to the jury regarding the aiding and abetting theory were insufficient and that the jury must find that Rosemond """"intentionally took some action to facilitate or encourage the use of a firearm"""" to convict. The Tenth Circuit affirmed Rosemond's conviction."
"A collective bargaining agreement directed Ray Holuch Gravel, a landscae suly comany, to remit contributions to several benefit funds affiliated with the Central Pension Fund, a labor union which reresents landscae suly comany emloyees. After conducting an audit of the comany's books in 2009, the union sued for additional remittances of ast unreorted work. They also sued for attorney's fees. The district court ruled in favor of the labor union on both issues with resect to one emloyee, but ruled against them with resect to emloyees who could not be identified because the landscae suly comany failed to kee the required records. The two decisions were announced searately and one week aart. The labor union aealed both rulings within thirty days of the second ruling, but more than thirty days after the first ruling. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit held that the aeal was timely because the attorney's fees are a merits issue, so the first decision was not final until the lower court had decided both cases."
"When a taxayer overays his taxes, he is entitled to interest from the government for the eriod between the date of overayment and the ultimate refund, but the """"date of overayment"""" is not secifically defined.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) informed the Ford Motor Comany (Ford) that it had underaid on its taxes between 1983 and 1989. Ford subsequently submitted deosits to the IRS that covered the underayment. Ford later requested that the deosits be considered to cover additional taxes that Ford owed. The arties eventually determined that Ford had overaid its taxes and was owed a refund. Ford argued that the date of overayment was the date that it first submitted the deosits to the IRS for the underayment of taxes, and the Government argued that the date of overayment was the date when Ford requested that the ayment cover additional taxes. Ford sued the Government in federal district court, and the court found in favor of the Government. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed."
"Former shareholders of Halliburton Comany (Halliburton) filed a class action lawsuit against the comany and argued that Halliburton falsified its financial statements and misreresented rojected earnings between 1999 and 2001. In their etition for class certification, the shareholders invoked the """"fraud on the market"""" resumtion to demonstrate their class-wide reliance on Halliburton's statements. The """"fraud on the market"""" theory assumes that, in an efficient market, the rice of a security reflects any material, ublic reresentation affecting that security. Therefore, under this theory, the law resumes that investors have relied on a material misstatement when they urchase a security at an artificially high or low rice. The federal district court certified the shareholders as a class and revented Halliburton from introducing evidence that the statements did not imact its stock rices at all. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed and held that Halliburton could not rebut the resumtion that the laintiffs relied on the statements until a trial on the merits of the laintiffs' claims."
"The laintiffs, Jackie Lawson and Jonathan Zang, brought a lawsuit against their former emloyer, FMR LLC, a subcontractor of Fidelity Investments (Fidelity), alleging that the comany unlawfully fired them in retaliation for filing comlaints. Both Lawson and Zang told the Occuational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) that they believed that Fidelity had violated certain rules and regulations set forth by both the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and federal laws relating to fraud against shareholders. Sometime after filing these comlaints, Zang was terminated for unsatisfactory erformance. Lawson filed several retaliation claims against her emloyer with OSHA, and resigned in 2007, claiming that she had been constructively discharged.Zang and Lawson each filed searate actions against their former emloyers in district court. They alleged that the defendants violated """"whistleblower"""" rotection sections of the Sarbanes-Oakley Act by taking retaliatory actions against them. The district court found in favor of the laintiffs and held that the whistleblower rovisions extended to emloyees of rivate agents, contractors, and subcontractors to ublic comanies and that the laintiffs had engaged in rotected activity under the statute. The defendants aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit, which reversed the decision. Looking at both Congressional intent and the lain meaning of the statute, the Court of Aeals held that the laintiffs were not rotected emloyees under the act."
"The Clean Air Act creates a federal-state artnershi that aims to control air ollution in the United States. The Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to both establish air quality standards and gives the states significant freedom to imlement lans in order to meet those standards. Among the roblems the Act sought to revent was the ossible sread of air ollution from """"uwind"""" states to """"downwind"""" states.In 2011, the EPA created the Transort Rule, a rule which sets emission reduction standards for 28 """"uwind"""" states based on the air quality standards in """"downwind"""" states. Various states, local governments, industry grous, and labor organizations brought suit in the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and argued that the Transort Rule created federal standards with no deference to the states, which violated federal law. The court held that the Transort Rule violated federal law because the Clean Air Act allows states to imlement their own lans to curb air ollution."
"Diana Alvarez and Manuel Lozano, two native Columbians, met while living in London and had a daughter together. At trial Alvarez testified that, from 2005 until 2008, Lozano was abusing and threatening to rae her. Lozano denied these allegations and claimed that, although they had normal coule roblems, they were generally """"very hay together."""" In November 2008, Alvarez took the child and, after a stay at a women's shelter, moved to her sister's home in New York. A sychiatrist diagnosed the child with ost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) caused by her exerience living in the United Kingdom, moving to America, staying at a women's shelter, and knowing that her mother had been threatened. However, six months later, the child's condition drastically imroved.After Lozano exhausted all remedies within the UK to attemt to locate the child, on November 10, 2010, he filed a Petition for Return of Child under Article 2 of the Hague Convention and the International Child Abduction Remedies Act in U.S. district court. The district court held that the child was now settled in New York and that removing the child would cause undue harm. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"Doyle R. Paroline led guilty to ossession of 150-300 images of child ornograhy. Included among those files on his comuter were two hotograhs of Amy Unknown, a victim of child ornograhy. He was sentenced to 24 months of incarceration followed by release under suervision. Under a federal statute that mandates full restitution to victims of child ornograhy by those convicted of creating, distributing or ossessing such material, the Government and Amy sought restitution in the amount of nearly $3.4 million. The district court denied restitution and held that the statute required the Government to rove that Paroline's ossession of the images was the roximate cause of the injuries for which restitution was sought. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and held that Paroline was resonsible for restitution for all the victim's losses even if his criminal acts occurred after the victim's losses."
"Marcus Burrage was arrested for distribution of heroin and distribution of heroin resulting in the death of Joshua Banka. A jury found him guilty, and Burrage was sentenced to nearly 40 years in rison. He aealed and argued that the judge allowed inadmissible hearsay into evidence, denied his motion for acquittal, and denied his motion for a new trial based on rosecutorial misconduct and erroneous jury instructions.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision on all counts. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to convict Burrage of the crime. The court also noted that exerts resented adequate testimony that Banka would not have died but for the heroin in his system. Additionally, the court held that in-court testimony of the olice officer was not hearsay."
"In 2006, Edward Lane acceted a robationary osition as Director of the Community Intensive Training for Youth (""""CITY"""") rogram at Central Alabama Community College (""""CACC""""). He subsequently terminated the emloyment of Suzanne Schmitz, a state reresentative who had not erformed any work for the rogram desite being listed on CITY's ayroll. Lane also testified against Schmitz in two federal criminal trials between 2008 and 2009. In January 2009, Steve Franks, the resident of CACC, sent termination letters to 29 CITY emloyees, including Lane, but rescinded the terminations of 27 of those emloyees within a few days. Lane sued Franks in federal district court and alleged that his termination from the CITY rogram was in retaliation for his testimony against Schmitz and therefore violated his First Amendment right to free seech. The district court ruled that the doctrine of qualified immunity shielded Franks from liability and granted summary judgment in his favor. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed but declined to reach a decision on the qualified immunity question. Instead, the aellate court held that the First Amendment did not rotect Lane's testimony because it was made ursuant to his official duties as a ublic emloyee."
"Freddie Lee Hall was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death for the 1978 murder of Karol Hurst. Hall sought a writ of habeas corus and a stay of execution in state court, which was denied. Hall then sought a writ of habeas corus in federal court and was denied without an evidentiary hearing. Hall aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which reversed in art and remanded the case for a hearing regarding the otential effect of his absence from the courtroom during the trial and ineffective counsel. On remand, the district court again denied habeas corus and held that Hall's absences from the courtroom were harmless and that he deliberately byassed ineffective counsel claims. The Court of Aeals affirmed.Hall etitioned the Sureme Court of Florida for habeas corus relief based on the Sureme Court decision in emHitchcock v. Duggerem, which held that all mitigating factors should be considered rather than just the mitigating factors listed in the relevant statutes. The Sureme Court of Florida denied the etition and held that no error occurred in sentencing. After the governor signed his second death warrant, Hall filed a motion to vacate the sentence, which the trial court denied by holding that the Sureme Court of Florida's decision barred further review of the case. The Sureme Court of Florida disagreed and held that the case involved additional non-record facts that had not been considered in the revious review. The case was vacated and remanded for new sentencing. At the new sentencing trial, the trial court held that Hall's mental retardation was a mitigating factor with """"unquantifiable weight,"""" and he was again sentenced to death. The Sureme Court of Florida affirmed.In 2002, the Sureme Court decided the case emAtkins v. Virginiaem, in which the Court held that the execution of mentally retarded defendants constituted cruel and unusual unishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Hall filed a motion to declare certain sections of the Florida death enalty statute unconstitutional based on this decision and filed a claim to be exemt from the death enalty under that ruling. The trial court held a hearing to determine if Hall was eligible for such a claim and found that he was not because the first rong of the test—whether he had an IQ below 70—could not be met. The Sureme Court of Florida affirmed."
"S. Binyomin Ginsberg became a member of the Northwest Airlines frequent flyer rogram in 1999 and obtained Premium Elite Status in 2005. In 2008, his membershi was terminated, as er the terms of the rogram that allow Northwest Airlines discretion over the removal of articiants. In January 2009, Ginsberg sued Northwest Airlines and argued that, by terminating his membershi in the frequent flyer rogram, the comany breached both the contractual agreement and the imlied doctrine of good faith and fair dealing under Minnesota law.At trial in district court, the defense argued that Ginsberg's claims were reemted by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), which rohibits states from enacting or enforcing regulation over the rice, route, or service of an air carrier. The district court found in favor of Northwest Airlines. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that the ADA did not reemt the claims because the claims were unrelated to the rice, route, or services of the air carrier."
"Workers at the United Steel Cororation brought a class action suit against the comany arguing that the Fair Labor Standards Act required the comany to comensate them for time sent changing into and out of work clothes and the transit time from the locker room to their work stations. The Act states that an emloyer does not need to comensate emloyees for time sent """"changing clothes."""" United States Steel Cororation moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion as it relates to comensation for changing clothes but not in relation to comensation for transit time.The comany aealed, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit held that Act did not require the comany to comensate the emloyees for either the time sent changing or the time sent in transit between the locker room and the work stations."

In January 2005, she began suffering from ain from fibromyalgia as well as Irritable Bowel Syndrome and luus. By June, her condition was so severe that she had to leave work. In August 2005, Heimsehoff filed a claim with Hartford Life &am; Accident Insurance Co. (Hartford) for Long Term Disability benefits. Heimsehoff's doctor failed to rovide an analysis of her condition to Harford, so Hartford denied her claim in December 2005. In May 2006, Heimsehoff obtained counsel to assist her in obtaining benefits. After several evaluations by other doctors, Hartford denied Heimsehoff's claim again in November 2006, finding that she could erform the duties of her former osition. Heimsehoff aealed the decision, but Hartford denied her claim for a final time in November 2007.Heimsehoff sued in district court, alleging that Hartford violated the Emloyment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in denying her claim. The district court dismissed the suit as time barred because the lan unambiguously rohibited legal action more than three years after roof of loss is required. Heimsehoff argued that the three-year statute of limitations should instead run from the date when Hartford denied her claim for the final time. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"The resondents are all immigrants to the United States and are considered lawful ermanent residents. At various times each of the resondents alied for family-sonsored visas. However, because of the delays caused by visa quotas and serious backlogs in the U.S. immigration system meant that all of their children had turned twenty-one and, based on the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), had """"aged out"""" of eligibility for any derivative child-visas. As a result, their visa alications converted from child-alications to adult-alications and were moved to the bottom of the adult-alication list, which otentially added years to their wait to receive a visas.In 2009, after the Board of Immigration Aeals converted several child visa etitions to adult etitions, the resondents filed two cases in federal district court in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California asking hat the court order the Board to retain use of their children's original visa filing dates. That court denied the request. The resondents then aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit. There, the etitioners argued that certain rovisions in the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) should allow the use of the children's original alication dates for certain visa alications. The Ninth Circuit agreed, holding that the language of both CSPA and the INA allow the child-status etition to convert to an adult etition while still retaining the original date when the visa etition was filed."
"Carol Anne Bond worked for the chemical manufacturer Rohm and Haas. When she learned that her friend Myrlinda Haynes was regnant and that Bond's husband was the father, she used her connections with the chemical comany to obtain the means for revenge. She stole and urchased highly toxic chemicals that she alied to Haynes' doorknobs, car door handles, and mailbox. Haynes suffered a minor burn, and after contacting a federal investigator, Bond was identified as the eretrator. She was charged with several violations of the Chemical Weaons Convention Imlementation Act of 1998 (Act).In the district court, Bond moved to dismiss the case and argued that Congress did not have the authority to enforce the Act because it subverted states' rights in violation of the Tenth Amendment. The district court denied the motion, and Bond conditionally led guilty with the understanding that she could continue to aeal the decision regarding the validity of the Act. She was sentenced to six years in rison. Bond renewed her challenge to the Act in the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit, which held that Bond did not have standing to aeal. The U.S. Sureme Court reversed the decision and held that the case must be considered on its merits. The case was remanded back to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the 3d Circuit. The Court of Aeals held that the Act was within Congress' ower to enact and enforce."
"Peggy Young was emloyed as a delivery driver for the United Parcel Service (UPS). In 2006, she requested a leave of absence in order to undergo emin vitroem fertilization. The rocedure was successful and Young became regnant. During her regnancy, Young's medical ractitioners advised her to not lift more than twenty ounds while working. UPS's emloyee olicy requires their emloyees to be able to lift u to seventy ounds. Due to Young's inability to fulfill this work requirement, as well as the fact that she had used all her available familymedical leave, UPS forced Young to take an extended, unaid leave of absence. During this time she eventually lost her medical coverage. Young gave birth in Aril 2007 and resumed working at UPS thereafter.Young sued UPS and claimed she had been the victim of gender-and disability-based discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. UPS moved for summary judgment and argued that Young could not show that UPS's decision was based on her regnancy or that she was treated differently than a similarly situated co-worker. Furthermore, UPS argued it had no obligation to offer Young accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act because Young's regnancy did not constitute a disability. The district court dismissed Young's claim. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed."
"In early 2005, Benjamin Carter worked for Kellogg Brown &am; Root (KBR), a U.S. Government contractor roviding logistical services to the U.S. military in Iraq. In 2006, Carter filed a whistleblower suit against KBR for fraudulent billing ractices under the False Claims Act (FCA). Carter alleged that KBR had a standing olicy of filling out fraudulent time sheets and thus overbilling the U.S. Government for services rendered in Iraq.In 2010, just before trial, the U.S. Government informed the arties of a comlaint that was filed earlier and alleging similar claims. The district court ruled that the earlier suit was related to Carter’s claims and dismissed the suit under the FCA’s “first-to-file” requirement, which bars a suit if a related one is ending. In 2011, Carter refiled his comlaint, and KBR moved to dismiss by arguing that the latest comlaint was filed after the FCA’s six-year statute of limitations had exired, and Carter’s comlaint did not satisfy the first-to-file rule because there was yet another related matter ending. The district court dismissed Carter’s comlaint, but the U.S Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed. The aellate court held that the Wartime Susension of Limitations Act (WSLA), which susends the alicable six-year statute of limitations, only alies to criminal charges and, because the remaining related cases had since been dismissed, there was no ending related matter to revent Carter’s claim from roceeding."
"Retirees from the Point Pleasant Plant in Ale Grove, West Virginia⎯owned by M&am;G since 2000⎯sued after M&am;G announced that the retirees would be required to contribute to the cost of their medical benefits. The retirees, who had been emloyees of Ale Grove before the lant was bought by M&am;G, entered into a series of collective bargaining negotiations through their unions regarding healthcare benefits. Just as earlier versions had included, the 2005-2008 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) included a rovision that """"caed"""", or limited, the comany's annual contribution towards emloyee healthcare benefits. In 2006, M&am;G announced it was requiring emloyees to cover their individual costs once that ca was exceeded in resonse to the shifting healthcare landscae. The retirees claimed that language in the effective CBA romised full coverage of healthcare benefits for life without any contribution requirement and sued the comany because that """"caing"""" rovision was not included in the ension and insurance booklet or adoted by the union on behalf of emloyees in the latest agreement. The retirees sued under the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA) and the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).The district court dismissed the retirees' claim, and they aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit, which reversed and remanded the case back to the district court. The district court found in favor of the retirees but ordered that their healthcare benefits be reinstated to the ost-2007 version that included emloyee contributions. Both arties aealed the decision, and the Court of Aeals affirmed the district court's judgement."
"The Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) received a comlaint from a woman who claimed Mach Mining, LLC (Mach Mining) denied her a job because of her gender. The EEOC determined that there was reasonable cause to believe Mach Mining had discriminated against female alicants and began conciliation, but the arties ultimately could not agree and the EEOC sued on the female alicants' behalf. Mach Mining argued that the EEOC did not conciliate in good faith, and the EEOC moved for summary judgment on whether failure to conciliate in good faith is a viable defense to its suit for unlawful discrimination. The district court denied the motion and held that courts may review the EEOC's informal settlement efforts to determine whether the EEOC made a sincere and reasonable effort to negotiate.Nonetheless, the court certified the question to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit. The aellate court reversed and held that, so long as the EEOC has leaded that it comlied with Title VII and the relevant documents are facially sufficient, judicial review is satisfied. The aellate court noted that Title VII gives the EEOC comlete discretion to accet or reject settlement offers during informal conciliation and rovides no standard to evaluate the failure-to-conciliate affirmative defense. Therefore, the aellate court determined that allowing an emloyer to use failure-to-conciliate as an affirmative defense would rotract and comlicate emloyment discrimination cases."
"Colorado imoses a 2.9% tax on the sale of tangible goods in the state, which retailers with a hysical resence in the state are required to collect from urchasers and remit to the state. If a Colorado urchaser has not aid the sales tax on tangible goods, as occurs in some online and mail-order transactions in which the businesses have no hysical resence in Colorado, the urchaser must ay a 2.9% use tax and is resonsible for reorting and aying the tax to the state. To increase the rate of collection of the use tax, in 2010, Colorado imlemented regulations for non-collecting retailers whose gross sales in Colorado exceed $100,000. These retailers must rovide transactional notices to Colorado urchasers, send annual urchase summaries to Colorado customers, and annually reort Colorado urchaser information to the Colorado Deartment of Revenue. Retailers that do not comly with these regulations are subject to enalties.In June 2010, Direct Marketing Association (DMA)—a grou of businesses and organizations that market roducts via catalogs, advertisements, broadcast media, and the Internet—sued the Colorado Deartment of Revenue's executive director and argued that the regulations violated the Commerce Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce. The district court granted DMA's request for an injunction and later granted summary judgment in favor of DMA. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit did not reach a decision on the merits of the aeal and instead held that the Tax Injunction Act derived the district court of jurisdiction to enjoin Colorado's tax collection effort."
"In 2010, Moones Mellouli, a citizen of Tunisia residing in the United States, was arrested for driving under the influence. While Mellouli was detained, olice discovered four tablets of Adderall in his sock. Although initially charged with trafficking a controlled substance in a jail, Mellouli ultimately led guilty to the lesser charge of ossessing drug arahernalia in violation of a Kansas statute. In 2012, the government attemted to deort Mellouli ursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which states that aliens convicted under any law """"relating to a controlled substance"""" as defined by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), are deortable.In immigration court, Mellouli argued that, since his 2010 conviction did not secify a articular controlled substance and the Kansas statute includes some substances not included in the CSA, his conviction did not necessarily """"relate to a controlled substance"""" for the uroses of the INA. The judge rejected the argument and held that Mellouli was deortable because the articular controlled substance involved in his conviction was irrelevant. The Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) affirmed and held that ossession of drug arahernalia involves drug trade in general, which is """"related to a controlled substance,"""" and therefore Mellouli's conviction met the criteria required by the INA. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eight Circuit denied Mellouli's etition for review and his etition for rehearing en banc. The aellate court held that the BIA's conclusion was reasonable in light of the INA's use of the general term """"relating to"""" instead of a more secific term like """"involving."""""
"Bobby Chen was the owner of a residential roerty that was damaged when the city of Baltimore and the city's contractor P &am; J Contracting Comany were in the rocess of razing the adjacent rowhouse. Chen originally sued in 2009 and alleged that, instead of reairing the damage they had caused, the defendants razed Chen's roerty on the retext that it was an unsafe structure. The court dismissed the case later in 2009 due to Chen's failure to meet various rocedural deadlines. Chen filed a second action in 2011, but when the clerk of the court issued summonses, they were returned as undeliverable and the 120-day limit for the eriod of service lased. The court issued an order requiring Chen to show cause about why his case should not be dismissed, and Chen sought an extension of time to effect service of rocess. The court granted Chen a further 60-day extension, and he was warned that failure to effect service of rocess during this time would result in dismissal. The 60-day eriod exired and the defendant moved for dismissal, which the trial court granted. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal."
"The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires emloyers to ay overtime wages to emloyees who work more than 40 hours er week. However, the FLSA also rovides exemtions to this overtime rule for emloyees, including those """"emloyed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or rofessional caacity…or in the caacity of outside salesman.""""Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) is a national trade organization that reresents real estate financial comanies and their emloyees across the country.

In 2006, the Deartment of Labor issued an oinion letter that stated that mortgage loan officers' duties fell within the definition of """"administrative"""" and that they qualify for the excetion to the overtime rule in the FLSA. In 2010, however, the Deuty Administrator issued a second ronouncement that declared that a mortgage loan officer did not qualify for the administrative emloyee excetion. MBA sued the Deartment of Labor in district court and argued that the agency could not change its interretation without first going through a notice-and-comment eriod required by the Administrative Procedure Act. The district court denied MBA's motion for summary judgment.

"Kwai Fun Wong, a citizen of Hong Kong and leader of the Wu Wei Tien Tao religious organization, was arrested and deorted by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for unlawful entry into the U.S. Prior to her deortation, Wong was briefly detained by the INS, during which she claimed to have been treated negligently by the INS. Under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), no civil suit may be filed against the United States unless the claimant has first filed a claim with the relevant federal agency and that claim has been denied.Following denial, a claimant has six months to file suit or the suit is ermanently barred. Wong filed a claim with the INS and, following the denial of that claim, sought leave from the district court to add a civil claim against the U.S. to her already outstanding suit against a number of federal officials. For unexlained reasons, the district court did not allow Wong to amend her comlaint until seven months later, after the six-month deadline had assed. The district court then dismissed Wong’s federal civil comlaint and held that the six-month deadline was “jurisdictional” and thus not subject to equitable tolling, or delaying the time at which a statute of limitations begins to run. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and found that equitable tolling could be alied to the six-month deadline.This case was consolidated with emUnited States v. Juneem, a case in which the conservator (financial manager) of an estate argued that the two-year statute of limitations for filing suit under the FTCA should not have begun to run until she had access to the deositions of federal emloyees without which she could not have been aware of her claim against the federal government. As in emWongem, the federal government claimed that this statute of limitations was “jurisdictional,” and thus not subject to equitable tolling. The district court agreed with the federal government and dismissed the suit. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that equitable tolling was aroriate based on its earlier oinion inemWong v. Beebeem."
"In 1970, Congress created the National Railroad Passenger Cororation (Amtrak) through the Rail Passenger Service Act and gave them the riority to use track systems owned by freight railroads for assenger travel. In 2008, Congress gave Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) joint authority to issue metrics and standards addressing scheduling, including on-time erformance and train delays. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) sued the Deartment of Transortation, the FRA, and two officials alleging that the metrics and standards are unconstitutional. The AAR alleged that allowing a rivate entity, like Amtrak, to exercise joint authority in their issuance violated the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause by vesting the coercive ower of government in an interested rivate arty, and also violated the constitutional rovisions regarding searation of owers by lacing legislative authority in a rivate entity.The district court rejected the AAR’s argument, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia reversed holding that Amtrak is a rivate cororation and Congress violated the constitutional rovisions regarding searation of owers."
"The London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) is a daily interest rate benchmark that is used to hel set the interest rate of financial transactions across the globe. Between August 2007 and May 2010, it has been alleged that the LIBOR rate was artificially maniulated downward by a number of colluding financial institutions. Ellen Gelboim was one of many arties to file individual suits against these financial institutions. Given the large number of cases, Gelboim's case was consolidated with a number of other similar cases for re-trial uroses. During this re-trial hase, the district court dismissed a number of the cases, including Gelboim's, for failure to state a claim. Gelboim sought to aeal the dismissal, however the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit dismissed Gelboim's aeal and held that it lacked jurisdiction over the aeal because the district court had not entered a final order concerning all the claims in the consolidated action."
"Naranjibhai and Ramilaben Patel are owners and oerators of motels in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Municial Code (LAMC) requires motel oerators to kee records with secified information about their guests. The LAMC also authorizes olice officers to insect hotel records at any time without a search warrant. The Patels filed suit and argued that the rovision violated their Fourth Amendment rotections against unreasonable searches. The city of Los Angeles argued that motels are """"closely regulated"""" businesses and are therefore subject to warrantless insections.The district court determined that motels were not subjected to the same kind of ervasive and regular regulations as other recognized """"closely regulated"""" businesses. Nonetheless, the court held that motels do not have an ownershi interest that gives rise to a rivacy right in their records because the records were created to comly with the ordinance. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit initially affirmed, but later reversed in rehearing en banc. The aellate court held that the hotel records were rivate """"aers"""" rotected by the Fourth Amendment and that the LAMC's warrantless search rovision was unreasonable because it does not rovide for re-comliance judicial review of an officer's demand to insect a motel's records."
"In the sring of 1994, Hana Bank, a Korean entity, began to extend its services to the United States under the name Hana Overseas Korean Club. In advertisements distributed during the summer of 1994, Hana Bank included the name """"Hana Overseas Korean Club"""" in English as well as """"Hana Bank"""" in Korean. The advertisements also included Hana Bank's logo, known as the """"dancing man."""" A second, distinct entity, Hana Financial, Inc. (HFI) was founded in California in the fall of 1994. In 1996, HFI obtained a federal trademark for their logo, a yramid, with the words """"Hana Financial"""" for use in financial services. Hana Bank officials were aware of HFI's use of the name Hana Financial but did not see the need to take any action because the entities did not directly comete with each other.In 2007, HFI filed a comlaint against Hana Bank alleging trademark infringement. The district court jury found that Hana Bank had used the """"Hana Bank"""" trademark in the United States continuously since before HFI began using the """"Hana Financial"""" trademark in 1995 and that Hana Bank's trademark could be """"tacked"""" to their 1994 advertisements, which included a similar, but distinct use of the hrase """"Hana Bank."""" HFI aealed, claiming that the determination of whether a trademark may be """"tacked"""" to a rior mark is a question of law that must be determined by the court, not a question of fact that may be decided by a jury.

"Until 2000, the Arizona State Constitution granted the State Legislature the ability to draw congressional districts, subject to the ossibility of a gubernatorial veto. In 2000, the Arizona voters assed Proosition 106, which amended the state constitution to remove the congressional redistricting ower from the legislature and vest it in the newly created Arizona Indeendent Redistricting Commission (IRC).In 2012, after the IRC aroved a new congressional district ma, the legislature sued the IRC and argued that Proosition 106 violated the Elections Clause of the federal Constitution by removing redistricting authority from the legislature and therefore that the new district ma was unconstitutional and void. The legislature also requested that the district court ermanently enjoin the IRC from adoting, imlementing, or enforcing the new congressional district ma.

In Setember 2009, the city's board of aldermen, which has sole authority over the city's emloyment decisions, fired Johnson and James suosedly for violations of olice rocedure and residents' rights. Johnson and James sued the city in district court and argued that they were fired because they refused to ignore the criminal activities of Harold Billings, one of the city's aldermen. Therefore, the city's decision to fire Johnson and James violated their Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights and maliciously interfered with their emloyment in violation of state law. The city moved for summary judgment based on the fact that Johnson and James failed to include a civil action for derivation of rights under Section 1983 in their comlaint. The district court granted the motion for summary judgment and denied James and Johnson's subsequent motion to amend their comlaint. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decisions."
"The """"three strikes"""" rovision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) rohibits a risoner from roceeding in forma aueris in federal court if the risoner has, on three or more rior occasions while incarcerated, brought an action or aeal that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim. Andre Lee Coleman, a Michigan state risoner, filed several claims while incarcerated. His first claim was dismissed as frivolous, and his second claim was dismissed for failure to state a claim. Coleman's third claim was also dismissed for failure to state a claim, but he aealed the judgment. Coleman's aeal of his third claim was unresolved when he subsequently filed his fourth claim and moved to roceed in forma aueris.The district court denied Coleman's motion and held that Coleman's three revious dismissals revented him from roceeding in forma aueris on his fourth claim. The court then ordered Coleman to ay the $350 filing fee. After Coleman failed to ay the fee and his fourth claim was dismissed, Coleman aealed.

"On March 17, 2010, a reschool teacher at Cleveland's William Patrick Day Head Start Center noticed some facial injuries on one of her three-year-old students. When the teacher inquired about the injuries, the student indicated that his mother's boyfriend, Darius Clark, caused them. The teacher forwarded her concerns to a child-abuse hotline, which resulted in the arrest and subsequent charging of Clark for child abuse.Prior to trial, a judge ruled the three-year-old child was incometent to testify but refused to exclude the child's out-of-court identification of Clark as his abuser. Clark was found guilty. On aeal Clark claimed that the admission of the child's out-of-court statements violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. The Sureme Court of Ohio reversed the lower court's ruling and held that, because state law required the teacher to reort susected incidences of child abuse, the teacher was acting as an agent for law enforcement when inquiring about the child's injuries. Therefore, the child's out-of-court statements could only be admitted if the rimary urose of the teacher's questioning was to address an ongoing emergency, as oosed to attemting to establish ast events. Because the child was not in immediate danger of further injury, the out-of-court statement could not be admitted."
"Low Income Housing Tax Credits are federal tax credits distributed to low-income housing develoers through an alication rocess, and the distribution is administered by state housing authorities. In 2009, the Inclusive Communities Project (ICP), a non-rofit organization dedicated to racial and economic integration of communities in the Dallas area, sued the Texas Det. of Housing and Community Affairs (TDHCA), which administers the Low Income Housing Tax Credits within Texas. ICP claimed that TDHCA disroortionately granted tax credits to develoments within minority neighborhoods and denied the credits to develoments within Caucasian neighborhoods. ICP claimed this ractice led to a concentration of low-income housing in minority neighborhoods, which eretuated segregation in violation of the Fair Housing Act.At trial, ICP attemted to show discrimination by disarate imact, and the district court found that the statistical allocation of tax credits constituted a rima facie case for disarate imact. Using a standard for disarate imact claims that the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit articulated in emTown of Huntington v. Huntington Branch em, the court then shifted the burden to TDHCA to show the allocation of tax credits was based on a comelling governmental interest and no less discriminatory alternatives existed. TDHCA was unable to show no less discriminatory alternatives existed, so the district court found in favor of ICP. TDHCA aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit and claimed that the district court used the wrong standard to evaluate disarate imact claims. The aellate court affirmed and held that the district court's standard mirrored the standard romulgated by the Deartment of Housing and Urban Develoment, the agency tasked with imlementing the Fair Housing Act."
"Fauzia Din, who is a United States citizen, filed a visa etition for her husband Kanishka Berashk, a citizen and resident of Afghanistan. Nine months later, the State Deartment denied the etition based on a broad rovision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that excludes aliens on terrorism-related grounds. Berashk asked for clarification of the visa denial and was told that it is not ossible for the Embassy to rovide him with a detailed exlanation of the reasons for denial.After several other unsuccessful attemts to receive exlanation of the visa denial, Din sued and argued that denying notice for aliens who were not granted a visa based on terrorism grounds is unconstitutional. The district court held that Din did not have standing to challenge the visa denial notice. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that the government is required to give notice of reasons for visa denial based on terrorism grounds."

After Sheehan threatened her social worker when he attemted to erform a welfare check, he became concerned that she was a danger to herself or others and summoned the olice for hel transorting her to a mental health facility for a 72-hour involuntary commitment. When the olice officers arrived, they entered Sheehan's room without a warrant to take her into custody. Sheehan grabbed a knife and threatened to kill the officers. They were forced to withdraw outside her room and call for backu, but instead of waiting for the backu to arrive, they drew their weaons and forced their way back into her room. When Sheehan again threatened the officers with a knife, they shot her several times.Sheehan sued the officers and the city for violations of her Fourth Amendment right to be free from warrantless searches and seizures as well as violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, and Sheehan aealed. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that there were triable issues of material fact regarding whether the officers' second entry into Sheehan's room was reasonable under the circumstances and whether the officers failed to reasonably accommodate Sheehan's disability as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act."
"Hector Ayala, a Hisanic man, was charged with three counts of murder and one count of attemted murder stemming from a failed robbery. During jury selection for his trial in California state court, the rosecution used seven reemtory challenges to exclude each black or Hisanic rosective juror. Ayala challenged the rosecution's use of reemtory challenges as a violation of the Sureme Court's decision in emBatson v. Kentuckyem, which held that the exclusion of jurors on the basis of race was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In accordance with emBatsonem, if a arty can make a rima facie showing that reemtory challenges are being used in a racially motivated way, the other arty must give a non-racially motivated reason for their use of the reemtory challenges. The state court allowed the rosecution to give their non-racially motivated reasons in a closed hearing, from which Ayala and his attorneys were excluded, and subsequently found the rosecution's use of reemtory challenges was not racially motivated. Ayala was not given the rosecution's reasoning or a transcrit of the meeting until after the conclusion of his trial. Additionally, after the trial it was discovered that the vast majority of the questionnaires all the otential jurors had to fill out had been lost. Ayala was found guilty of the majority of the charges against him and sentenced to death.On aeal, the California Sureme Court found that the state court erred in excluding Ayala from the emBatsonem hearing, but that error as well as the loss of the questionnaires were harmless, and therefore uheld Ayala's conviction. Ayala aealed to the U.S Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit and argued that the emBatsonem hearing rocedure and loss of the questionnaires violated his constitutional rights. In accordance with the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the aellate court found that the California Sureme Court had not adjudicated Ayala's claims of federal constitutional violations on the merits largely on the basis that the California Court had determined the rocedure used for the emBatsonem hearing violated California state law; therefore the aellate court reviewed Ayala's claims emde novoem and found that the exclusion of Ayala from the emBatsonem hearing, as well as the loss of the questionnaires, violated Ayala's constitutional rights. To determine whether the errors were harmless, the Court of Aeals alied the standard set forth in em Brecht v. Abrahamsonem , which asked whether the errors had a substantial and injurious influence on the jury's verdict, and found that the exclusion of Ayala from the Batson  hearing derived him of the ability to revail on a comelling emBatsonem challenge."
"In 1995, Kevan Brumfield was convicted of the murder of a Louisiana olice officer and sentenced to death. After the Sureme Court decided em Atkins v. Virginia em in 2002, which held the execution of mentally retarded criminals violated the Eighth Amendment's rohibition of cruel and unusual unishment, Brumfield filed for ost-conviction relief on the basis that he was mentally retarded. Brumfield also requested funds to hel develo his emAtkinsem claim. The Louisiana state court found that Brumfield was not entitled to an emAtkinsem hearing because Brumfield did not resent enough evidence to establish he was mentally imaired. The Louisiana Sureme Court denied his aeal without exlanation.Brumfield next filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus in federal court and argued that the state courts had erred in failing to give him a full emAtkinsem hearing. He also requested funding to enable him to fully resent his claims, which was granted. A federal magistrate found that, while the state court had correctly ruled that Brumfield's initial evidence regarding his mental retardation was not adequate for the court to have granted emAtkinsem relief, the additional funds enabled Brumfield to establish a rima facie case of mental retardation. The federal magistrate subsequently recommended that the district court admit Brumfield's new evidence when determining his habeas claim; the district court did so and ruled in favor of Brumfield by forbidding Louisiana from executing him. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and held that the state court's ruling on Brumfield's emAtkinsem claim constituted a decision on the merits, so the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act revented the district court from reviewing the decision unless the state court's decision was contrary to clearly established federal law or based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. Because the state denied Brumfield additional funds to develo his case due to his failure to establish a rima facie case of mental retardation, the decision was not a violation of Brumfield's constitutional due rocess rights nor based on an unreasonable determination of the facts."
"Tony Henderson was a former United States Border Patrol Agent who was charged with, among other crimes, distribution of marijuana. On June 9, 2006, two days after he was arrested, Henderson voluntarily turned 19 firearms over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which he argued was for """"safekeeing as a condition of the bond."""" He later led guilty to his narcotics charges.In 2008 and 2009, Henderson requested that the FBI return his firearms so that he could transfer them to a urorted buyer, but the FBI refused to do so. Henderson then moved the district court to allow him to transfer the firearms to the 2009 buyer or his wife. The magistrate judge recommended denial of the motion because Henderson was a convicted felon, and the district court adoted the recommendation. Henderson aealed and argued that, because he had not been given notice that his guilty lea would disqualify him from firearm ownershi, he is entitled to relief. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the decision of the lower court."

"Learjet, Inc. and other retail buyers of natural gas (Learjet) sued Oneok, Inc. and other energy trading comanies (Oneok) for artificially increasing energy rices during the 2000–2002 energy crisis in violation of several states' antitrust laws. Learjet claimed that Oneok reorted false data and engaged in """"wash sales,"""" which are rearranged sales in which traders execute a trade on an electronic trading latform, and then immediately offset that trade by executing an equal and oosite trade. Oneok moved to dismiss Learjet's claims and argued that the claims were re-emted by the federal Natural Gas Act (NGA). The Natural Gas Act regulates interstate, wholesale natural gas trade, but it does not aly to retail sales of natural gas. The district court granted Oneok's motion to dismiss and held that Learjet's claims were re-emted by the NGA because Oneok's actions affected wholesale rices as well as retail rices. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that, because Learjet suffered harm in retail transactions, which the NGA does not regulate, Learjet's claims were not re-emted."

Hargis Industries (Hargis) sells self-drilling screws under the mark """"Sealtite"""" in the construction industry. After Hargis alied to register its mark in 1996, B&am;B oosed the alication and sued Hargis for infringement. The Trademark Trial and Aeal Board (TTAB) eventually determined that there was a likelihood of confusion between the two marks and denied Hargis' alication. On aeal, the district court held that, because the TTAB is not an Article III court, it need not give deference to the TTAB decision and refused to admit the decision into evidence. A jury then found in favor of Hargis. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed and held that, since the Eighth Circuit uses a slightly different likelihood of confusion test from the TTAB, the TTAB did not decide the same likelihood of confusion issues resented to the district court."
"Jesse Busk and Laurie Castro were former emloyees of Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. (Integrity), a comany that rovides warehouse sace and staffing to clients such as Amazon.com. Busk and Laurie both worked in warehouses in Nevada filling orders laced by Amazon.com customers. At the end of each day, all the workers were required to ass through a security clearance checkoint where they had to remove their keys, wallets, and belts, ass through a metal detector, and submit to being searched. The whole rocess could take u to 25 minutes. Similarly, u to ten minutes of the workers' 30-minute lunch eriod was consumed by security clearance and transition time. In 2010, Busk and Castro sued Integrity and argued that these ractices violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) as well as Nevada state labor laws.The district court granted Integrity's motion to dismiss and held that time sent clearing security was non-comensable under the FLSA and that the shortened meal eriods were not relevant to the FLSA because the laintiffs did not argue that they erformed work-related duties during their lunch eriods. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in art and reversed in art. While the Court of Aeals agreed that the shortened lunch eriods were not relevant to the FLSA, the Court of Aeals held that the district court should have assessed the laintiffs claims that the security clearances were """"integral and indisensable"""" to their work in order to determine if that time was comensable."
"Plaintiffs were investors who bought Omnicare securities in a December 15, 2005 ublic offering. At the same time, Omnicare offered 12.8 million shares of common stock and made related filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings were incororated into a Registration Statement. The laintiffs sold all the securities by January 31, 2006. Plaintiffs brought suit under §11 of the Securities Act of 1993 claiming Omnicare materially misled or omitted material information on the registration statement because they were engaged in illegal activities that included kickback arrangements with harmaceutical manufacturers and submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid. Plaintiffs further allege that Omnicare failed to comly with Generally Acceted Accounting Princiles (GAAP), which resulted in a substantial overstatement of the comany's revenue affecting the 2005 ublic offering.The original suit filed in the district court had multile claims from which this case arose, but all were dismissed in favor of Omnicare. The claims were dismissed because the laintiffs failed to lead that the defendants had knowledge of wrongdoing when they materially falsified information on the registration statement. The United States Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the dismissals excet one filed under §11 for materially misleading or omitting material information because that claim was filed under a strict liability statute which did not require leading to knowledge of wrongdoing. The Court held that laintiffs had met their burden for making a rima facie case under §11 and remanded the case to district court."
"Brian Wynne and his wife are Howard County, Maryland residents who own stock in Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc. (Maxim), a comany that rovides health care services nationally. Maxim's income is """"assed through"""" to its owners, and the owners are then taxed individually. In 2006, Maxim filed income tax returns in 39 states and allocated a share of taxes aid to each shareholder. The Wynnes claimed the share of Maxim's income taxes that they aid as a credit against their Maryland individual income tax, which includes Maryland state taxes and Howard County taxes. The Comtroller of Maryland determined that the Wynnes had incorrectly calculated their county tax credit by including the taxes they had aid to other states and issued an assessment for the remaining tax owed. The Wynnes aealed to the Hearings and Aeals Section of the Comtroller's Office, which noted that the wrong county tax rate had been alied initially and revised the assessment, but nonetheless affirmed that the tax credit was limited to Maryland state taxes and not alicable to Howard County taxes.The Wynnes aealed to the Maryland Tax Court and argued that the limitation violated the dormant Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The Tax Court rejected the Wynnes' argument and affirmed the revised assessment. The Wynnes then aealed to the Maryland Circuit Court for Howard County. The Circuit Court reversed the Tax Court's decision and held that the county tax without a credit violated the dormant Commerce Clause. The Comtroller aealed to the Maryland Court of Aeals and argued that the Commerce Clause was not imlicated by the county tax. The Maryland Court of Aeals affirmed the Circuit Court by finding that the county tax imlicates the dormant Commerce Clause because it affects the interstate market for caital and business investment and the overlaing ower to tax income from such sources. The Maryland Court of Aeals held that the county tax without a credit violated the Commerce Clause because the county tax is not fairly aortioned, since taxayers who earn income from interstate activities would be taxed at higher rates than taxayers who earn income exclusively in Maryland while the tax covers income earned wholly outside of Maryland. The Maryland Court of Aeals also held that the county tax is discriminatory against interstate commerce since it favors businesses that do business rimarily in Maryland."
"Clyde Reed, astor of Good News Community Church (Good News), rented sace at an elementary school in Gilbert, Arizona, and laced about 17 signs in the area announcing the time and location of Good News' services. Gilbert has an ordinance (Sign Code) that restricts the size, number, duration, and location of certain tyes of signs, including temorary directional ones, to revent imroer signage. After Good News received an advisory notice from Gilbert that it violated the Sign Code, Good News sued Gilbert and claimed that the Sign Code violated the Free Seech Clause of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.The district court found that the Sign Code was constitutional since it was content-neutral and was reasonable in light of the government interests. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed and held that, even though an official would have to read a sign to determine what rovisions of the Sign Code alied, the restrictions were not based on the content of the signs, and the Sign Code left oen other channels of communication."
"In 2006, Gregory Warger was involved in an automobile collision with another car driven by Randy Shauers. Warger filed suit against Shauers for damages resulting from the crash, and Shauers filed a counter-suit. After an initial mistrial, a jury found for Shauers. Warger aealed on the basis that, following the verdict, Warger's attorney had been contacted by a jury member who exressed concern that the jury foreerson had imroerly gained the symathy of the other jurors by informing them all that her daughter had been in a similar tye of automobile accident and that the verdict would have had a negative imact on her life had she been found resonsible. Warger claimed that the foreerson's alleged misconduct should result in a new trial because it was imroer outside influence, which tainted the jury's verdict, and because it was evidence that the foreerson had lied during jury selection.The district court ruled that the concerned jury member's statement was inadmissible based on Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b), which bars the testimony of a juror concerning any statements made during the jury's deliberations for uroses determining the validity of a verdict, with an excetion for testimony regarding whether an imroer outside influence was used to ersuade any juror. Secifically, the court ruled that the ast life exeriences of the foreerson did not constitute imroer outside influence. While 606(b) does not exlicitly bar juror testimony for the uroses of roving dishonesty by a otential juror during jury selection, in this case the evidence was barred by 606(b) because it was based on statements the foreerson made during the jury's deliberations. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed."
"The North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners (Board) is a statutorily created agency that regulates the ractice of dentistry. It is comosed of six dentists⎯who are elected by other dentists in North Carolina⎯one dental hygienist, and one consumer member. The Board may bring an action in the North Carolina Suerior Court to enjoin the conduct of any individual the Board susects of engaging in the unlawful ractice of dentistry.In 2003, non-dentists began offering teeth-whitening services to consumers in mall kiosks and salons across the state. After dentists comlained, the Board sent 47 cease and desist letters to 29 non-dentist teeth-whiteners. The non-dentists ceased offering the service, and manufacturers and distributors of over-the-counter teeth-whitening roducts exited the North Carolina market.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) subsequently charged the Board with violating the Federal Trade Act by excluding the non-dentists. An Administrative Law Judge found that the Board had engaged in unfair cometition and enjoined the Board from issuing any more cease and desist letters; the FTC uheld that ruling on aeal. The Board etitioned the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit to review the FTC decision and argued that, as a state agency, it was exemt from federal antitrust laws. The Court of Aeals declined to review the case and held that, when a state agency is oerated by market articiants who are elected by other market articiants, the agency is a rivate actor and subject to federal antitrust laws."
"Edison International is a holding comany for electric utilities and energy interests. Since 1999, Edison International and its related benefits and investment committees (collectively, Edison) have offered retail-class mutual funds as art of its 401(k) emloyee benefits lan, even though otherwise identical institutional-class funds that charged lower fees were available. Those mutual funds also give a ortion of the fees collected back to lan service roviders, including Edison's, which thereby reduces Edison's administrative costs.In 2007, Glenn Tibble and other Edison emloyees (Emloyees) sued under the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which requires fiduciaries of an emloyee benefit lan to administer the lan rudently for the exclusive benefit of the articiants. The Emloyees argued that the continued inclusion of the higher-cost funds in the benefit lan was a """"continuing violation"""" of ERISA. Edison argued that ERISA's statute of reose, which bars claims filed more than six years after the date of the last action which constituted a art of the violation, revented Emloyees' claim. The district court granted summary judgment for Edison and held that there was no """"continuing violation"""" theory under ERISA. The court stated that the act of designating an investment for inclusion started the six-year eriod, and since Edison had not made any misstatements or actively concealed any breach following the initial inclusion, the six-year eriod had assed. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"Alabama imoses a 4% sales tax on the gross receits of retail businesses and a 4% use tax on storage, use, or consumtion of tangible ersonal roerty. Accordingly, rail carriers that urchase diesel fuel within the state are subject to a 4% sales tax. However, motor and water carriers that urchase fuel in Alabama ay an excise tax of $0.19 er gallon.In 2008, CSX Transortation, Inc. (CSX) sued the Alabama Deartment of Revenue for violating the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1974 (4-R Act), which targeted local and state taxation schemes that discriminated against rail carriers. CSX argued that the sales tax was discriminatory because it required the rail carriers to ay more than their cometitors for urchasing diesel fuel in the state. The district court dismissed the case and U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal by citing recedent that held that a railroad could not challenge its cometitors' exemtions from a sales tax as discriminatory under the 4-R Act. The Sureme Court granted certiorari, overturned the ruling, and remanded the case. On remand, the district court conducted a bench trial and issued an order holding that the state's sales tax does not discriminate against rail carriers for the uroses of the 4-R Act, because the amount that motor carriers aid was roughly equal to that aid by rail carriers. The Court of Aeals reversed the lower court's decision and held that the tax is discriminatory because the state had not offered sufficient justification for exemting CSX's cometitors from the sales tax."
"On Aril 29, 2010, Sergeant Darisse of the Surry County Sheriff's Deartment observed Maynor Javier Vasquez driving north on I-77 with a broken brake light. When Darisse ulled over the vehicle, he noticed another man, Nicholas Heien, lying under a blanket in the backseat. Darisse soke with the two men, felt that their stories did not match u, and was concerned that Heien had not gotten u from the back seat. Darisse asked for ermission to search the vehicle. Heien agreed, and Darisse found a bag containing 54.2 grams of cocaine in the car.A grand jury indicted Heien for two counts of trafficking cocaine. Heien filed a motion to suress the evidence discovered during the search of his vehicle, and the trial court denied the motion. The North Carolina Court of Aeals reversed the trial court and held that the traffic sto was not objectively reasonable because North Carolina law only required one working brake light. The North Carolina Sureme Court reversed and held that when an officer's mistake of the law is reasonable, it may give rise to the """"reasonable susicion"""" required for a traffic sto of a vehicle under the Fourth Amendment. That North Carolina Sureme Court sent the case back to the state Court of Aeals.The North Carolina Court of Aeals found no error in the trial court's judgment. A dissenting judge, however, stated that the North Carolina Sureme Court's ruling created """"fundamental unfairness"""" because it held citizens to the traditional rule that """"ignorance of the law is no excuse"""" while allowing olice to be ignorant of the law. Based on this dissent, Heien again aealed to the North Carolina Sureme Court which rejected Heien's aeal."
"In 2002, Manachem Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem to arents who are United States citizens. Manachem's arents requested that the U.S. State Deartment record his lace of birth on his assort as """"Israel,"""" in accordance with Section 214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2003 (Act). The State Deartment refused and instead issued Manachem a assort that listed """"Jerusalem"""" as his lace of birth. His arents sued the Secretary of State on his behalf and sought the enforcement of Section 214(d). The district court dismissed the case on the grounds that it resented a non-justiciable olitical question. The U.S. Sureme Court, in emZivotofsky v. Clintonem, reversed that holding and remanded the case. On remand, the district court held that Section 214(d) """"imermissibly intereferes"""" with the President's exclusive ower to recognize foreign states. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed and held that the section goes beyond the scoe of Congress's assort ower to affect United States foreign olicy, which is a realm the Constitution reserves for the executive branch."
"IndyMac MBS, Inc. (IndyMac MBS) is an issuer of mortgage-backed securities that issued securities known as mortgage ass-through certificates. The Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit and the Wyoming Retirement System filed two searate class action suits on behalf of asserted members of the class who had urchased some of the certificates. The suits claimed that IndyMac MBS had made fraudulent misreresentations and omissions regarding the sale of the certificates. The district court consolidated these suits and dismissed the claims for lack of standing.Desite the fact that the three-year statute of limitation set out in the Securities Act of 1933 had exired, several utative class members sought to intervene and revive the claims. They argued that the rule established in emAmerican Pie &am; Construction Co. v. Utahem, which allowed the commencement of a class action to susend the statute of limitations as it relates to members of the class, alied in this case. They also argued that Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allowed them to """"relate back"""" their claims to the original class action suit. The district court denied the motions to intervene, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"Gregory Holt (also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad) was an inmate of the Arkansas Deartment of Corrections and a racticing Salafi Muslim. He sought an injunction and temorary relief from the enforcement of the Arkansas Deartment of Corrections' grooming olicy, which allowed trimmed mustaches and quarter-inch beards for diagnosed dermatological roblems but otherwise no facial hair. Holt argued that growing a beard was a necessary art of the ractice of his religion, that the grooming olicy significantly burdened his ability to do so, and that the grooming olicy was therefore a violation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). Holt was willing to limit his beard to a length of one-half inch as a form of comromise with the olicy.The district court granted temorary relief but then dismissed the comlaint uon being resented with evidence of the other ways in which Holt was allowed to ractice his religion and the extent to which the grooming olicy was necessary to maintain rison security. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed."
"On February 23, 2007, Larry and Cheryle Jesinoski refinanced their Eagan, Minnesota, home by borrowing $611,000 from Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. The Jesinoskis received a Truth in Lending Act (TILA) disclosure and a Notice of the Right to Cancel, which gave them until midnight on February 27, 2007, to rescind the loan. The Jesinoskis did not exercise their right to cancel the loan, and they used the money to ay off several consumer debts. On February 23, 2010, the Jesinoskis attemted to rescind the loan and argued that they did not receive sufficient coies of the TILA disclosure and the Notice of the Right to Cancel. After the request to rescind the loan was denied, the Jesinoskis sued Countrywide Home Loans for failure to rescind their loan on February 24, 2011.Countrywide Home Loans sought a judgment on the leadings and argued that the Jesinoskis did not file their suit within the three-year time eriod allowed by TILA. The Jesinoskis argued that, because they attemted to rescind the loan within the three-year time eriod, their suit fulfills that requirement and should be allowed to roceed. The district court found in favor of Countrywide Home Loans; the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed."
"In 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began investigating Samuel Johnson based on his involvement in an organization called the National Social Movement. Later in 2010, Johnson left that grou to found the Aryan Liberation Movement. In November of that year, Johnson told an undercover FBI agent that he manufactured naalm, silencers, and other exlosives for the Aryan Liberation Movement in addition to ossessing an AK-47 rifle, several semi-automatic weaons, and a large cache of ammunition. In Aril 2012, Johnson was arrested at a meeting with his robation officer and admitted to ossessing some of the reviously mentioned weaons.A grand jury charged Johnson with six counts of firearm ossession, three of which relied on his classification as an """"armed career criminal."""" This classification was based on the fact that he had three rior felony convictions that the district court designated as """"violent felonies""""—attemted simle robbery, simle robbery, and ossession of a short-barreled shotgun. Pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), Johnson was then subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years. Johnson argued that the convictions in question should not be considered violent felonies and that the ACCA was unconstitutionally vague. The district court held that the felony convictions in question were in fact violent felonies and that Johnson was an armed career criminal for the uroses of the mandatory minimum sentence required by the ACCA. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed."
"On October 30, 2012, Brandon W. Owens filed a class action etition in state court that alleged that Dart Cherokee Basin Oerating Comany and Cherokee Basin Pieline underaid the members on the class on royalties they were owed from wells. The etition alleged that this underayment constituted a breach of contract and sought damages without secifying an amount.On December 5, 2012, the defendants removed the case from state court to federal district court and cited that federal jurisdiction existed under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA). CAFA requires that three elements be established for a class action case to fall under federal jurisdiction: at least one laintiff and one defendant must be citizens of different states, the class must consist of at least 100 members, and the amount in controversy must exceed $5 million. The defendants in this case claimed that they met the requirements for removal to federal court under CAFA because the amount in controversy exceeded $8 million, but did not include secific evidence in the notice of removal. The federal district court held that defendants had not rovided evidence that the amount in controversy exceeded $5 million in the notice of removal and therefore remanded the case back to state court.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit held that the district court should not have remanded the case because requiring the arty requesting the removal to roduce evidence that the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million creates an evidentiary burden. The Court of Aeals held that that such evidence is wholly unnecessary unless the removal is contested. A arty requesting that a case be removed to federal court need only allege that the grounds for removal exist and need only rove those allegations if they are contested."
"In 1990, Stehen Kimble obtained a atent for a Sider-Man toy that was set to exire in May 2010. Kimble claimed that he discussed the idea with the resident of Marvel Enterrises Inc., and that he would be comensated for use of his ideas. Although no agreement was reached, Marvel roduced a toy that was similar to Kimble's design. In 1997, Kimble sued for atent infringement, and the arties settled in 2001, with Marvel agreeing to urchase the atent and ay royalties to the etitioner without an exiration date. The case was subsequently dismissed. In 2006, Marvel entered a licensing agreement with Hasbro Inc. that gave it the right to roduce the toy. Disagreements arose between Kimble and Marvel concerning the royalty ayments, and Kimble claimed that the original atent would be infringed if royalties were not aid. Kimble sued Marvel in Arizona state court, and the case was then removed to the federal district court.The magistrate judge determined that settlement agreement was a """"hybrid"""" agreement, in which atent and non-atent rights were insearable, and that the Sureme Court decision in emBrulotte v. Thys Co.em alied. In that case, the Court ruled that, when atents are sold in return for a royalty ayment, the urchaser was not obligated to continue these ayments beyond the exiration date of the atents because doing so would over-comensate the seller of the atent and imroerly extend the atent monooly beyond the intended time limit. On recommendation of the magistrate, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Marvel and ruled that the settlement agreement transferred atent rights, but that it was unclear if non-atent rights were transferred. Kimble aealed and argued that the settlement agreement transferred both atent and non-atent rights and that, while royalty ayments ended for the atent, they did not end for the toy itself. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision of the district court."
"On July 19, 1988, Houston Police Officer Elston Howard was in the midst of arresting the clerk of an adult bookstore when Robert Mitchell Jennings entered the store intending to rob it. Jennings shot Officer Howard four times and then roceeded to rob the store. The trial court jury subsequently convicted Jennings of caital murder. In the sentencing hase of the trial, the rosecution resented evidence of Jennings' long criminal history as an aggravating factor. The defense called the jail chalain to testify to his oinion that Jennings was not """"incorrigible,"""" and the defense did not resent any further evidence of mitigating factors.In 1996, Jennings filed a state habeas etition and argued that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at the unishment hase because his attorneys had failed to contact his family to rovide evidence of a disadvantaged background and had failed to find and resent a 1978 sychological reort that suggested that Jennings had a """"mild organic brain dysfunction."""" The state court held that Jennings' attorneys had conducted a sufficient investigation into his background, and that their decision not to introduce this testimony and evidence was a reasonable trial strategy. The state court recommended that the Texas Court of Criminal Aeals deny the request for habeas relief, and the Texas Court of Criminal Aeals acted accordingly.In 2009, Jennings filed a federal habeas etition with the district court. The district court granted the etition and held that Jennings had received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorneys failed to resent evidence of his disadvantaged background and ossible mental incaacities. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and held that Jennings' counsel's decision not to ursue these avenues of argument was a legitimate trial strategy. The Court of Aeals also held that a federal habeas etitioner must file a certificate of aealability in order to resond to arguments concerning the state's aeal."
"On August 17, 2007, John L. Yates and his crew reared his fishing vessel for a commercial fishing tri into federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. On August 23, 2007, Officer John Jones, a field officer with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission who was emowered to enforce federal fisheries laws, boarded the vessel and noticed red grouer fish that aeared to be smaller than the requisite 20 inches. Officer Jones measured the grouer that aeared smaller and found a total of 72 fish that measured under 20 inches. Officer Jones laced these fish in wooden crates, issued Yates a citation, and informed Yates that the National Marine Fisheries Service would seize these fish uon the vessel's return to ort. Contrary to Officer Jones' directions, Yates instructed his crew to throw the fish in question overboard and relace them with larger fish. When the vessel returned to ort and the fish were measured on August 27, Officer Jones susected that Yates had disosed of the fish he had measured.Yates was charged with destruction and falsification of evidence. At trial he argued that the fish thrown overboard were not actually undersized because Officer Jones had measured the fish with their mouths closed, which shortens the length of fish. The district court found Yates guilty of disosing of undersized fish and therefore in violation of a statute that makes it a crime to destroy or conceal """"a tangible object with the intent to imede, obstruct, or influence"""" a governmental investigation. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed."
"Sandoz, Inc., (Sandoz) and Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Mylan) submitted Abbreviated New Drug Alications (ANDAs) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to roduce and market generic versions of Coaxone, a drug used to treat Multile Sclerosis. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., the manufacturer of the original drug, sued Sandoz and Mylan and used two different tyes of claims that are based on different ways to use molecular weight to distinguish between olymer samles. The district court did not distinguish between the different methods of using molecular weight and held that the claims were not indefinite as Sandoz and Mylan argued. After a bench trial, the district court held that the Sandoz and Mylan roducts infringed on Teva's atent.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit held that the district court did not error in holding that the atents were infringed, but that some of the claims had not been effectively shown to be definite."
"In July 2003, the Transortation Security Administration (TSA) learned of a otential lot to hijack US lanes and briefed the Federal Air Marshals accordingly. Not long after that briefing, the TSA notified the Marshals that all missions on flights from Las Vegas would be cancelled until August. Federal Air Marshal Robert J. MacLean became concerned that the TSA was not aroriately resonding to the threat and creating a danger to the flying ublic, so he contacted an MSNBC reorter about the situation in an attemt to create a ublic controversy. MSNBC ublished an article, and several members of Congress joined in criticizing the decision to cancel the missions. That decision was then rescinded. In 2004, MacLean aeared disguised on NBC Night News, and some TSA emloyees recognized his voice. During the course of the investigation that followed, MacLean revealed his role in the 2003 MSNBC article. This contact was deemed to be an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive security information, and MacLean was removed from his osition.MacLean challenged the determination that he disclosed sensitive security information before the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit. MacLean argued that the information about the cancellation of missions was not classified at the time he received it and could not be retroactively classified. The Court of Aeals held that the TSA had simly alied regulations already in force in 2003 to determine that information should fall under that classification. MacLean also challenged his removal before the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) and argued that his actions were rotected under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA). The Board determined that MacLean's actions did not fall under the WPA because they were exlicitly rohibited by law. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the Board's ruling and held that MacLean's actions were not exlicitly rohibited by law under the WPA."
"The Voting Rights Act of 1965 focuses on reserving the equal reresentation of voters in different legislative voting districts. In 2012, the Alabama legislature redrew Alabama’s electoral districts with the goal of creating districts with a oulation deviation of only 1%, as oosed to the 5% courts traditionally allow when evaluating redistricting efforts. Alabama also tried to maintain the existing ercentage of minority voters in each electoral district. Petitioners sued in district court and argued that Alabama’s redistricting violated the Voting Rights Act and amounted to racial gerrymandering that had negative imacts on the equal reresentation of racial minorities in multile electoral districts. The district court held that the etitioners had failed to rove that Alabama used race as a “dominant and controlling” factor in redrawing its electoral districts and also that Alabama’s goal of maintaining the minority oulation ercentages in existing districts was “narrowly tailored” to a comelling state interest. The Sureme Court noted robable jurisdiction to address the district court’s alication of existing legal rinciles."
"Commil USA, LLC (Commil) holds a atent on a method to imlement short-range wireless networks. Commil sued Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco) and alleged that Cisco erformed the atented method and induced its customers to infringe by erforming the atented method. Cisco argued that Commil's atent was invalid for indefiniteness, non-enablement, and lack of written descrition. The district court found for Commil and awarded more than $70 million in damages. Cisco aealed and argued that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that the standard for inducement was negligence and recluded the submission of evidence of Cisco's good-faith belief that Commil's atent was invalid. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and held that the standard for induced infringement is actual knowledge or willful blindness, and therefore that a good-faith belief of atent invalidity was a defense to claims of induced infringement."
"On Setember 26, 2008, Larry Whitfield and Quanterrious McCoy attemted to rob the Fort Financial Credit Union in Gastonia, North Carolina. After their robbery attemt was foiled by the bank's security system, the two fled. McCoy was later found hiding under a van, while Whitfield entered the Parnell residence and attemted to contact a getaway vehicle. Mary Parnell was subsequently ronounced dead of a heart attack. Whitfield was arrested nearby and signed a confession admitting to breaking into several homes as well as the attemted bank robbery.A grand jury indicted McCoy and Whitfield on several counts relating to the failed robbery, but only Whitfield was indicted for forcing someone to accomany him and killing that erson while trying to avoid being arehended for the commission of a crime. Whitfield moved to dismiss this charge and argued that it was unconstitutionally vague and that the rosecution was required to rove that he intentionally caused Parnell's death. The district court denied the motion. Prior to the jury's deliberations, the district court instructed the jury that, in order to find Whitfield guilty of the additional charge, it only needed to find that his actions were the roximate cause of Parnell's death, and it did not include a minimum limit on the degree of accomaniment necessary. Whitfield objected to the instruction and the court overruled the objection. Whitfield was found guilty, but on the additional charge he was found guilty of forcing Parnell to accomany him, not of killing her. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated Whitfield's conviction and remanded the case for rehearing on the issue of whether or not the district court constructively amended the indictment in its jury instructions. On remand, the district court again found Whitfield guilty and the Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Richard Sharif and others entered into distributorshi contracts with Wellness International Network (WIN) for the sale of health and wellness roducts. Sharif and others later sued WIN and claimed that WIN was running a yramid scheme. The district court granted summary judgment for WIN and awarded $655,596.13 in attorney's fees as a sanction against Sharif and his co-laintiffs for ignoring some of WIN's discovery requests. WIN attemted to discover Sharif's assets, but Sharif ignored all attemts until he was held in civil contemt for discovery violations and arrested. In 2009, Sharif filed for Chater 7 bankrutcy. WIN filed an adversary roceeding in bankrutcy court and claimed that Sharif had continuously concealed roerty and information ertaining to his assets. The bankrutcy court found in favor of WIN and ordered Sharif to ay WIN's attorney's fees along with other sanctions.Sharif aealed to federal district court, but before he filed his first brief, the U.S. Sureme Court decided emStern v. Marshallem, which held that a bankrutcy court lacked the authority to enter a final judgment on a state-law counterclaim against a creditor. Sharif subsequently attemted to advance an argument based on emSternem, but the district court did not allow it. Instead, the district court held that such an objection can be waived and that Sharif's failure to bring u to argument earlier constituted an imlied waiver. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed in art and vacated in art. The Court of Aeals held that an objection based on emSternem cannot be waived and that the bankrutcy court only had the authority to enter a final judgment on some of WIN's claims."
"On December 15, 2005, Minnie Smith was found dead in the home she shared with her husband, Marvin Smith. Smith was charged with first-degree murder for the death of his wife. At the end of the trial, the rosecution asked for and received an aiding-and-abetting instruction, which would allow the jury to convict Smith even if they found that he had not delivered the fatal blow. The jury convicted Smith but did not secify which theory of guilt they adoted. The California Court of Aeal affirmed the conviction and rejected Smith's argument that he had not been given adequate notice of the ossibility of the aiding-and-abetting instruction. The California Sureme Court denied Smith's etition for review.Smith filed a etition for habeas relief. The Magistrate Judge recommended granting the relief, and the district court agreed. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed and held that Smith should have been aware that the aiding-and-abetting instruction was ossible because under California law aiding and abetting the crime is art of the same substantive offense as the commission of the crime itself. However, the aellate court held that Smith's Sixth Amendment right had been violated because the rosecution had tried the case on a single theory before adding the second instruction at the very end of the trial. In reaching this decision, the aellate court relied on its own recedent, which it claimed faithfully alied Sureme Court recedent."
"Telecommunications service rovider T-mobile South, LLC (T-mobile) submitted an alication to construct a 108–foot cell tower resembling a man-made tree (monoine) in Roswell, Georgia. The location of the site, though lanned inside a vacant lot, would be in an area zoned for single-family residences within a well-established residential neighborhood. Following an outouring of ublic oosition to the tower, Roswell's Planning and Zoning Division recommended that the Mayor and city council, who ultimately arove alications after a ublic hearing, imose certain conditions before aroving the alication. Secifically, the Planning and Zoning Division recommended that T-Mobile should relocate the site to another art of the roerty, erect a fence around the tower, and lant ine trees to shield it from residential owners' view. At the ublic hearing, city council members voted to deny the alication.Two days later, Roswell sent T-Mobile a letter notifying the comany that the alication was denied and referred the comany to the minutes of the ublic hearing. T-Mobile sued Roswell and claimed that the city had not rovided substantial evidence that would suort a denial of the alication. T-Mobile also alleged that, by rohibiting T-Mobile from building the structure, Roswell violated the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA). The district court did not rule on the substantial evidence question and instead held that Roswell had not met the """"in writing"""" comonent of the TCA, which required the government to state the reason(s) for denying an alication. The district court ordered Roswell to grant the ermit, and Roswell aealed. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that Roswell had met the """"in writing"""" requirement by issuing a written denial and referring to the minutes of the hearing for the reasoning."
"Anthony Elonis was convicted under 18 U. S. C. §875(c), which criminalizes the transmission of threats in interstate commerce, for osting threats to injure his coworkers, his wife, the olice, a kindergarten class, and a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent on Facebook. The district court instructed the jury that a """"true threat,"""" which falls outside the scoe of First Amendment seech rotections, requires an objective intent to threaten. Elonis aealed and argued that """"true threats"""" require a subjective intent to threaten. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed Elonis' conviction and held that a subjective intent standard would fail to rotect individuals from the fear of violence which the """"true threat"""" excetion was created to revent."
"On March 27, 2012, a Nebraska K-9 olice officer ulled over a vehicle driven by Dennys Rodriguez after his vehicle veered onto the shoulder of the highway. The officer issued a written warning and then asked if he could walk the K-9 dog around Rodriguez's vehicle. Rodriguez refused, but the officer instructed him to exit the vehicle and then walked the dog around the vehicle. The dog alerted to the resence of drugs, and a large bag of methamhetamine was found.Rodriguez moved to suress the evidence found in the search, claiming the dog search violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures. The district court denied the motion. On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding the search was constitutional because the brief delay before emloying the dog did not unreasonably rolong the otherwise lawful sto."
"Baker Botts, LLP, along with Jordan, Hyden, Womber, Culbreth &am; Holzer, PC, was awarded about $120 million in fees for reresenting Asarco, LLC in its Chater 11 bankrutcy case, from which Asarco had emerged in 2009 with a reorganization lan that would ay its creditors in full. Baker Botts then filed for a final fee request, which Asarco contested. The bankrutcy court awarded Baker Botts more than $117 million to cover the fees in addition to $5 million for exenses incurred defending the fee claims. The district court affirmed. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the Bankrutcy Code did not allow the firms to recover $5 million sent defending the fee request against Asarco's oosition."
"In 2010, Congress assed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care. The ACA required each state to establish an """"exchange"""" through which eole could urchase health care coverage, and if a state elected not to do so, the federal government would establish one through the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The ACA also required eole to obtain the minimum essential coverage or ay a tax enalty unless they fell within an unaffordability exemtion for low-income individuals. To limit the number of eole that would fall into such an exemtion, the ACA rovided for tax credits that are calculated based on the health lan in which an individual enrolls through the exchange. Although the legislative language of the ACA ertaining to the tax credits only referred to the exchanges established by the states, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) created a regulation that made the tax credits available to those enrolled in lans through federal as well as state exchanges.Virginia declined to establish a state-run exchange and has one oerated by the federal government. The laintiffs are a grou of Virginia residents who, without the tax credits, would fall under the unaffordability excetion and be exemt from having to urchase health insurance. They sued and argued that the IRS regulation exceeded the agency's statutory authority, is arbitrary and caricious, and is contrary to the law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed."
"Louis Bullard borrowed $387,000 from Hyde Park Savings to buy his roerty in Massachusetts. In December 2010, he filed for Chater 13 of the Bankrutcy Code and roosed a lan in which he offered to ay the bank back the value of the roerty in a loan that was secured by the actual roerty and then ut the rest of the home loan into a ool with other debts that would be aid at a different rate. The bankrutcy court rejected this lan because it believed this hybrid lan was inconsistent with certain rovisions of the Bankrutcy Code. The bankrutcy aellate anel agreed but stated the order was aealable because Bullard could simly roose another lan. Bullard etitioned for an aeal but the bankrutcy aellate anel denied the etition because the etitioner had already filed his notice of aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit. The First Circuit held that it did not have jurisdiction, as courts of aeals only have jurisdiction over """"final decisions, judgments, orders and decrees."""""
"In August 2009, the Texas division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans (Texas SCV), a non-rofit organization that works to reserve the memory and reutation of soldiers who fought for the confederacy in the Civil War, alied to have a new secialty license late issued by the Texas Deartment of Motor Vehicles (TDMV). The roosed license late had two confederate flags on it: one in the organization's logo, and one faintly making u the background of the late. The TDMV had a olicy stating that it """"may refuse to create a new secialty license late if the design might be offensive to any member of the ublic."""" The board in charge of aroving new secialty lates received multile negative comments from the ublic regarding this late and ultimately voted to deny Texas SCV's alication.Texas SCV sued in federal district court claiming their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated. The TDMV argued that the Free Seech Clause did not aly in this case because license lates are a form of government seech; therefore, they were within their rights to choose which messages and views they wanted to exress on the lates. The district court disagreed and held that the lates were rivate, non-governmental seech, and that the TDMV's denial was a reasonable, content-based restriction of seech in a non-ublic forum. The United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and held that TDMV's denial was a form of viewoint discrimination that """"discriminated against Texas SCV's view that the Confederate flag is a symbol of sacrifice, indeendence, and Southern heritage."""""
"The federal Medicaid Act requires that state Medicaid lans contain rocedures to ensure that reimbursement rates for healthcare roviders """"are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough roviders"""" to meet the need for care and services in the geograhic area. Ninth Circuit recedent also requires that reimbursement rates bear a reasonable relationshi to Medicaid rovider costs, and where rates do not """"substantially reimburse roviders their costs,"""" a state cannot justify its rates with """"urely budgetary reasons."""" Richard Armstrong, the Director of Idaho's Deartment of Health and Welfare, and others (the Directors) conducted rovider cost studies and recommended increasing reimbursement rates but ultimately did not increase rates for budgetary reasons.A grou of Idaho Medicaid roviders (the Providers) sued the Directors and claimed that, based on the new cost information, the Deartment's failure to raise rates was not consistent with the Ninth Circuit's requirements. The Directors argued that the Suremacy Clause of the federal Constitution does not give roviders a rivate right of action and that the existing rates were consistent with the Medicaid Act's requirements of efficiency, economy, and quality of care. The district court granted the Providers' motion for summary judgment and held that the failure to increase rates led to a failure to substantially reimburse roviders. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"David Caulkett’s roerty was subject to two mortgage liens when he filed for bankrutcy. Because the debt owed on the first mortgage exceeded the value of the roerty, the second mortgage, which Bank of America held, was considered “underwater.” When Caulkett filed for bankrutcy, he moved the bankrutcy court to void Bank of America’s lien on the second mortgage and argued that Section 506(d) of the Bankrutcy Code allowed a debtor filing for bankrutcy to void a second mortgage when the debt owed on the first mortgage exceeded the value of the collateral roerty. The bankrutcy court granted the motion, and both the district court and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.This case was consolidated with a similar case, emBank of America v.

"Noel Reyes Mata, a citizen of Mexico, was convicted of assaulting a woman he was dating; he was deorted in 2010. His aeal to the Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) was dismissed after his attorney failed to file an aellate brief. Mata subsequently moved to reoen his case based on ineffective assistance of counsel, but the BIA denied Mata's motion as untimely because it was filed well after the 90 days allowed. Mata aealed the BIA's denial of his motion to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit and argued that the BIA should not have enforced the filing eriod limitation because his attorney's failure to file a brief derived him of his due rocess rights. The aellate court held that such a motion was subject to the comlete discretion of the BIA, and thus the aellate court lacked the jurisdiction to review the decision."
"On July 3, 2009, the Pennsylvania State Police Deartment received a reort that Michael Zita had stolen a car and two handguns and then likely fled to the Carman residence. Officers Jeremy Carroll and Brian Roberts went to the Carman residence to investigate and noticed that a small structure in the rear of the roerty had a light on a door oen, so they aroached and announced their resence. When no one resonded, the officers continued to aroach the house via a back door that the officers believed looked like a customary entrance. The residents confronted the officers, but eventually identified themselves as the Carmans and allowed the officers to search their house. The officers did not find Zita, and the Carmans were not charged with a crime.The Carmans later sued Officer Carroll in district court and argued that he had unlawfully entered their roerty in violation of the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. Carroll argued that his entry was legal under the """"knock and talk"""" excetion to the warrant requirement, which allows officers to knock on someone's door as long as the officers are standing on the arts of the erson's roerty on which the general ublic is allowed. The Carmans argued that excetion did not aly in this case because a normal visitor would have used the front door. The jury found in favor of Carroll, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed because the """"knock and talk"""" excetion requires that the olice begin their interaction at the front door. The aellate court also held that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunity because his actions violated clearly established law."
"In 1949 the U.S. Deartment of Agriculture imlemented the Marketing Order Regulating the Handling of Raisins Produced from Graes Grown in California (Marketing Order). The Marketing Order authorized the federal government to reserve a ercentage of the yearly California raisin cro to stabilize the suly, and thus the rice, of California raisins. Under the Marketing Order, farmers are entitled to a share of the roceeds acquired when, or if, the government sells the reserved raisins. Marvin Horne, a farmer and raisin roducer, attemted to skirt the Marketing Order by rocessing his own raisins, which he claimed exemted his raisins from the Marketing Order's reserve requirement. The Deartment of Agriculture claimed Horne's raisins were still subject to the Market Order, and following administrative roceedings, Horne was fined nearly $700,000.Horne sued the Deartment of Agriculture and claimed that the Marketing Order violated his Fifth Amendment rights against uncomensated takings. The district court found in favor of the Deartment of Agriculture. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that it lacked standing to address Horne's claim, because Fifth Amendment takings claims are within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. The United States Sureme Court held that the aellate court did have jurisdiction and remanded the case. On remand, the aellate court found for the Deartment of Agriculture by holding that the reserve requirement did not act as a emer seem taking because Horne's raisins constituted ersonal roerty rather than real roerty. The aellate court also held that the Marketing Order did not constitute a taking because there was a sufficient nexus, and rough roortionality, between the reserve requirement and the secific interest the government seeks to rotect, which in this case is the government's interest in stabilizing raisin rices."

At trial, McFadden argued that the state needed to rove that he was aware, or actively resisted finding out, that the bath salts were substantially similar to a controlled substance and constituted an analogue.

"In February 2010, Charles Harris filed for bankrutcy under Chater 13 of the Bankrutcy Code. The aroved lan instructed Harris to make monthly ayments to the trustee Mary Viegelahn for sixty months, as well as monthly ayments directly to Chase, which held his mortgage. After the mortgage and secured creditors debts were aid off, the ayments would go to Harris' unsecured creditors. In October 2010, Chase moved to lift the automatic stay of Harris' home for his failure to make the mortgage ayments, and Harris moved out of his house when the stay was lifted in November 2010. At that oint, Viegelahn held the ortion of the monthly ayments intended to go to Chase. After Harris voluntarily converted his bankrutcy case to Chater 7, Viegelahn distributed those funds to Harris' creditors. Harris sued for that money and argued that Viegelahn had no authority to disburse funds after conversion of the case. The bankrutcy court issued an order comelling the return of the funds and the district court affirmed.

"The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act require that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulate electric utility steam generating units (EGUs) if it finds that such regulation was """"aroriate and necessary"""" after conducting a utility study. In December 2000, the EPA issued a notice that such regulation was necessary based on the results of the utility study, which showed that the mercury emissions from EGUs were a threat to ublic health. In 2005, the EPA reversed its findings and determined that it was not """"aroriate and necessary"""" to regulate coal-and oil-fired EGUs. States and other grous etitioned for review, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the EPA's attemt to reverse its findings was unlawful because it could not remove ollutant sources from the regulation list once they were on it. In 2012, the EPA confirmed that EGU regulation was necessary and romulgated emission standards. State, industry, and labor grous etitioned the aellate court for review of the EPA's interretation of the """"aroriate and necessary"""" requirement with resect to these regulations.

After Sergeant Stan Hendrickson ordered Kingsley to take down the aer several times and each time was met with refusal, Lieutenant Robert Conroy, the jail administrator, ordered the jail staff to take down the aer and transfer Kingsley to another cell. During the transfer, Kingsley refused to act as ordered, so the officers ulled him to his feet in such a manner that his feet hit the bedframe, which caused ain and made him unable to walk or stand. In the new cell, when Kingsley resisted the officers' attemts to remove the handcuffs, Hendrickson ut his knee in Kingsley's back and Kingsley yelled at him. Kingsley also claimed that Hendrickson smashed his head into the concrete bunk. After further verbal exchange, another officer alied a taser to Kingsley's back.Kingsley sued Hendrickson and other jail staff members and claimed that their actions violated his due rocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.

"In the 1980s, George Toca was arrested and sentenced to life in rison without the ossibility of arole, robation, or susension of his sentence for accidentally shooting his friend while the two of them committed a robbery. At the time of the robbery, George was 17 years old and was considered a juvenile. In 2012, the Sureme Court held in emMiller v. Alabamaem that sentencing a juvenile to life in rison without the ossibility of arole was a violation of the Eighth Amendment's rotection against cruel and unusual unishment. In light of the emMillerem case, Toca alied for a Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence, which the district court aroved by holding that the emMillerem decision alied retroactively to cases like Toca's. The Sureme Court of Louisiana overturned that decision by denying Toca's motion and holding that the emMillerem rule does not aly retroactively because it is not a substantive rule, nor does it correct any substantive issues of fairness or accuracy in the criminal roceedings. The Sureme Court of Louisiana also held that the emMillerem rule is simly a new rule of criminal rocedure and does not aly retroactively."
"In 1999, a jury convicted Mark Christeson of caital murder for invading the home of a mother and her two children, raing the mother, and then cutting their throats and ushing them into the ond. The jury sentenced Christeson to death. In 2004, the Sureme Court of Missouri affirmed the conviction, which meant that Christeson's federal habeas etition was due on Aril 10, 2005. Nine months before the deadline, the Court aointed attorneys Phil Horwitz and Eric Butts to reresent Christeson. Horwitz and Butts failed to meet with Christeson until six weeks after the etition was due, and they filed the etition 117 days late. The federal district court dismissed the etition as untimely. Seven years later, Horwitz and Butts contacted attorneys Jennifer Merrigan and Joseh Perkovich to discuss Christeson's case. Merrigan and Perkovich discovered Christeson's only chance would be to reoen the final judgment on the grounds that the statute of limitation should not have been enforced in this case. Horwitz and Butts, knowing this would ruin their reutations, refused to let outside counsel access their files. Merrigan and Perkovich moved for substitution of counsel, which the district court denied because they were from out of state and because Horwitz and Butts had not abandoned their client.

"On Aril 29, 2014, Oklahoma executed Clayton Lockett using a three-drug lethal injection rocedure. The rocedure went oorly; Lockett awoke after the injection of the drugs that were suosed to render him unconscious and did not die until about 40 minutes later. Oklahoma susended all subsequent executions until the incident could be investigated and subsequently adoted a new rotocol that laced a higher emhasis on making sure the injection was done roerly. The new rotocol also allowed for four alternative drug combinations, one of which used midazolam as the initial drug, as did the rotocol used in the Lockett execution.Charles Warner and 20 other death row inmates sued various state officials and argued that the use of midazolam as the initial drug in the execution rotocol violated the Eighth Amendment's rohibition against cruel and unusual unishment. Warner and three other laintiffs also moved for a reliminary injunction to revent Oklahoma from moving forward with their executions. A federal district court denied the injunction and held that the laintiffs had not rovided sufficient evidence that they would revail on the merits of their claims and that they had failed to identify a """"known and available"""" alternative to the drug in question. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.On January 15, 2015, the Sureme Court declined to grant the etition for a writ of certiorari, and Charles Warner was subsequently executed.

She wore a headscarf, or hijab, every day, and did so in her interview. Elauf did not mention her headscarf during her interview and did not indicate that she would need an accommodation from the Look Policy. Her interviewer likewise did not mention the headscarf, though she contacted her district manager, who told her to lower Elauf's rating on the aearance section of the alication, which lowered her overall score and revented her from being hired.The Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) sued Abercrombie on Elauf's behalf and claimed that the comany had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by refusing to hire Elauf because of her headscarf. Abercrombie argued that Elauf had a duty to inform the interviewer that she required an accommodation from the Look Policy and that the headscarf was not the exression of a sincerely held religious belief. The district court granted summary judgment for the EEOC. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed and held that summary judgment should have been granted in favor of Abercrombie because there is no genuine issue of fact that Elauf did not notify her interviewer that she had a conflict with the Look Policy."

Frost was charged with robbery and related offenses. During closing arguments, Frost's lawyer exressed his desire to argue both that the rosecution did not meet their burden and that Frost acted under duress. The trial judge made the defense choose between the two alternative defenses, and the defense chose duress. The jury convicted Frost of multile counts.The Washington Sureme Court held that the trial court's restriction of the closing argument violated Frost's rights to due rocess and assistance of counsel. However, that decision constituted trial error, which makes the mistake reviewable, rather than structural error, which would require automatic reversal. Uon such review, the Washington Sureme Court held that there was sufficient evidence to convict Frost and uheld the conviction.Frost filed a etition for a writ of habeas of corus that the district court denied, and a anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal. Uon rehearing en banc, the aellate court reversed and directed the district court to grant the etition because the Washington Sureme Court unreasonably alied clearly established law by failing to classify the trial court's restriction of the defense's closing argument as structural error."

During the course of the robbery, several shots were fired and Makki was later discovered dead. Liggins and Zaya led guilty, and Donald was tried with Moore and Saine for one count of first-degree felony murder and two counts of armed robbery. When the government sought to admit evidence of hone communication among the defendants on the day in question, Donald’s lawyer indicated that evidence did not affect his client, so the judge allowed testimony to roceed when Donald’s lawyer was not in the courtroom. The jury convicted Donald on all three counts. He aealed and argued that his lawyer’s absence from the courtroom during the hone call testimony denied him his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. The Michigan Court of Aeals rejected the claim and the Michigan Sureme Court denied review.Donald moved for federal habeas relief, which the district court granted, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed by holding that the Michigan Court of Aeals did not roerly aly the recedent established by the Sureme Court’s decision in emUnited States v.

"In early 2002, a many years-long effort by Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold to reform the way that money is raised for--and sent during-- olitical camaigns culminated in the assage of the Biartisan Camaign Reform Act of 2002 (the so-called McCain-Feingold bill sometimes referred to as BCRA). Its key rovisions were a) a ban on unrestricted (""""soft money"""") donations made directly to olitical arties (often by cororations, unions, or wealthy individuals) and on the solicitation of those donations by elected officials; b) limits on the advertising that unions, cororations, and non-rofit organizations can engage in u to 60 days rior to an election; and c) restrictions on olitical arties' use of their funds for advertising on behalf of candidates (in the form of """"issue ads"""" or """"coordinated exenditures"""").The camaign finance reform bill contained an unusual rovision roviding for an early federal trial and a direct aeal to the Sureme Court of the United States, by-assing the tyical federal judicial rocess. In May a secial three-judge anel struck down ortions of the Camaign Finance Reform Act's ban on soft-money donations but uheld some of the Act's restrictions on the kind of advertising that arties can engage in.

"Between 1997 and 2006, Torrey Grady was convicted of two sexual offenses. After being released for the second time, a trial court civilly committed Grady to take art in North Carolina’s satellite-based monitoring rogram for the duration of his life. The rogram required articiants to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet so that authorities can make sure that articiants are comlying with rescritive schedule and location requirements. Grady challenged the constitutionality of the rogram and argued that the constant tracking amounted to an unreasonable search that was rohibited under the Fourth Amendment. Both the trial court and the North Carolina Court of Aeals held that wearing a GPS monitor did not amount to a search."
"Timothy Lee Hurst was charged and convicted of first-degree murder for killing his co-worker, Cynthia Harrison, during a robbery of the Poeye’s restaurant where they both worked. He was sentenced to death and aealed. On aeal, Hurst was granted a new sentencing trial because the Sureme Court of Florida found that his counsel should have investigated and resented evidence of Hurst’s borderline intelligence and ossible organic brain damage. At his new sentencing trial, Hurst was revented from resenting mental retardation evidence as an absolute bar to the imosition of the death enalty, though he was allowed to resent it as mitigating evidence. The jury again sentenced Hurst to the death enalty by a vote of seven to five, and the Sureme Court of Florida affirmed.In 2002, the Sureme Court decided the case emRing v. Arizonaem, in which the Court held that the Sixth Amendment required that the resence of aggravating factors, which Arizona’s death enalty sentencing scheme viewed as essentially elements of a larger offense, be determined by the jury. The Sureme Court of Florida had reviously held that the decision in emRing v.

"In 1963, Henry Montgomery was found guilty and received the death enalty for the murder of Charles Hunt, which Montgomery committed less than two weeks after he turned 17. He aealed to the Louisiana Sureme Court, and his conviction was overturned because of community rejudice. At his new trial, Montgomery was again convicted, but he was sentenced to life without arole.In 2012, the U.S. Sureme Court decided emMiller v. Alabamaem, in which the Court held that mandatory sentencing schemes requiring children convicted of homicide to be sentenced to life imrisonment without arole violate the Eighth Amendment. In light of that decision, Montgomery filed a motion in state district court to correct what he argued was now an illegal sentence. The trial court denied Montgomery’s motion, and the Louisiana Sureme Court denied Montgomery’s alication by holding that the decision in emMillerem does not aly retroactively."
"On Setember 7, 2008, Amy Imburgia filed a class action lawsuit against DIRECTV, Inc. (DIRECTV), and argued that DIRECTV had imroerly charged early termination fees to its customers. In 2011, the U.S. Sureme Court decided emAT&am;T Mobility LLC v. Concecionem, in which the Court held that the Federal Arbitration Act reemted California recedent that had reviously held that, in certain circumstances, arbitration clauses in customer agreements were unenforceable. Less than one month after that decision, DIRECTV moved to stay or dismiss the laintiffs’ case and comel arbitration, which DIRECTV argued it had not done reviously because it thought the arbitration clause in its customer agreement was void under California recedent. The trial court denied the motion and the California Court of Aeal for the Second District affirmed by holding that the language of the customer agreement subjected the arbitration clause to state law."
"In late 2008, Robert Montanile was involved in a car accident that resulted in significant injuries. Montanile was covered by an emloyee welfare benefit lan administered by the Board of Trustees of the National Elevator Industrial Health Benefit Plan (Plan). After Montanile’s accident, the Plan disersed over $120,000 to cover Montanile’s medical exenses. Montanile later sued the driver of the other car involved in the accident, eventually obtaining a $500,000 settlement. Per its terms, the Plan then requested that Montanile reimburse the initial $120,000 disbursement. When Montanile and the Plan were unable to reach an agreement, the Plan sued Montanile.The Plan is governed by the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which allows lan administrators to recover overayment from a beneficiary when the recovery would constitute “aroriate equitable relief”. The trial court held that the terms of the Plan required Montanile to reay the initial $120,000, and that this reayment was aroriate equitable relief in art because the Plan was able to identify a source of funds within Montanile’s ossession—the $500,000 settlement. Montanile aealed and claimed that the reayment would not be equitable relief because the settlement had been sent or disbursed to other arties. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that, because the Plan had a right to reimbursement, the Plan’s lien against Montanile’s $500,000 settlement attached before Montanile sent or disbursed the funds. Therefore, Montanile could not evade the reayment by claiming the settlement funds had been sent or disbursed."
"In December 2000, brothers Jonathan and Reginald Carr committed a series of crimes in Wichita, Kansas, known as “The Wichita Massacre,” which included assault, robbery, rae, and the murder of five eole. The Carrs were rosecuted jointly. They moved to sever their cases and argued that being tried jointly would be rejudicial because they intended to mount antagonistic defenses and introduce evidence that would be admissible or non-rejudicial only in searate trials. The trial judge denied the motion, and the Carrs were later jointly convicted on numerous counts and sentenced to death. The jury instructions at the sentencing trial did not state that mitigating circumstances need not be roven beyond a reasonable doubt.On aeal, the Carrs argued that their Eighth Amendment rights to individualized sentencing were violated both by the trial judge’s refusal to sever their cases and the failure to affirmatively instruct the jury that mitigating circumstances need not be roven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Kansas Sureme Court agreed and reversed the death sentences by holding that the trial judge failed to do the necessary analysis and carefully consider the severance issue. The court also held that the jurors may have been revented from giving meaningful effect to mitigating evidence because they were not instructed that mitigating circumstances need not be roven beyond a reasonable doubt.In the consolidated case, emKansas v. Gleasonem, Gleason was convicted of caital murder for the killings of several eole in connection with a robbery. He was also convicted of re-meditated murder, aggravated kidnaing, aggravated robbery, and criminal ossession of a firearm. The jury sentenced Gleason to death for the caital murder charge and a consecutive sentence of life in rison without the ossibility of arole for 50 years for the other charges. Gleason aealed his convictions, and the Kansas Sureme Court vacated his conviction of life imrisonment because it was multilicitous with his death sentence and vacated his death sentence because the jury was not roerly instructed on how to consider mitigating circumstances."
"William Thomson suffered a head injury aboard the SS. Rosina Marron after an attack by a fellow crewmember.  After several months of recueration, Thomson signed an agreement releasing Costal Oil Comany from liability in exchange for $4000.

"Clinton Jencks, a union leader, was charged with falsely filing an Affidavit of Non-Communist Union Officer with the National Labor Relations Board. Two undercover informants for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) testified against Jencks, and reorted that he had been seen at Communist Party events and working with Communist Party members. The evidence rovided against Jencks was entirely circumstantial, and the rosecution's evidence rested largely on the testimonies and reorts of the undercover informants. Jencks requested the testimony of the informants to review their credibility and admissibility in court. The trial court denied his request without stating the reasons, and Jencks was found guilty on two counts of communist activity and sentenced to five years imrisonment for each offense. Jencks aealed the lower court's decision on the grounds that the informants' reorts should have been rovided for review to determine their use in the trial and on the grounds that the jury was imroerly instructed on the definitions of olitical arty membershi. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the decision of the lower court."
"In December 1938, Thomas Leiter conveyed aroximately 8,711 acres of land in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana to the United States. The deed contained a mineral reservation under which Leiter retained the right to mine and remove all valuable minerals until Aril 1, 1945. The deed allowed for the extension of this reservation for an additional five years so long as oerations were conducted rofitably during the revious five years for an average of fifty days a year. If at the end of the original term or an additional extended term the oeration had not carried on for fifty days a year, Leiter’s right to mine would terminate, and comlete title would become vested in the United States. No mineral oerations were conducted on the land in question during the original term.On March 1, 1949, the United States conveyed the oerating rights under lease to Frank J. and Albert Lobrano, who then conveyed those rights to The California Comany. The California Comany drilled and comleted eighty wells, roducing $3,500,000 in royalties for the United States. Leiter Minerals, Inc. then filed an action in state court against Allen L. Lobrano and The California Comany based on a Louisiana law allegedly making a reservation of mineral rights to the United States “imrescritible”. The United States was not a arty to the suit. Leiter Minerals claimed that it was the fee simle owner of all the oil, gas and mineral rights in or on the land acquired by the United States from Thomas Leiter.The United States then brought an action in district court; it sought to quiet Leiter Minerals’ title and rights and to enjoin Leiter Minerals from further asserting any claims in state court. The United States argued in art that irrearable injury in the form of lost royalties would result from any disossession to its lessees. The district court granted the injunction, holding that the action could only be tried in federal court because the United States was not a arty to the state court action."

While assing through Dayton, Ohio, the train braked abrutly to avoid hitting a car stoed on a railroad crossing. Herdman fell and was injured as the train came to a sto.Herdman sued the railroad comany for negligence and claimed that the comany was resonsible for his fall under the doctrine of ires isa loquituri. Courts tyically aly this doctrine when negligence can be inferred, without actual direct evidence, from the very nature of the accident. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio ruled in favor of the railroad on the basis that Herdman did not rovide enough facts to suort his negligence claim, even under the ires isa loquituri doctrine.

"Beginning on October 23, 1950, Lion Oil Comany and Oil Workers International Union CIO entered into a collective bargaining agreement roviding in detail the wages, hours and conditions for emloyees of the comany. The agreement rovided the means to amend its terms: Either arty must notify the other in writing of its desire to amend the agreement, after which the comany and the union should attemt to agree on the desired amendments. If no agreement was reached within sixty days, either arty may terminate the agreement.On August 24, 1951, the union transmitted a letter to the comany notifying the comany of its desire to modify the agreement. Reresentatives of the comany and the union first met on August 29, 1951 to discuss the roosed amendments. The two grous held 37 more meetings between that date and Aril 30, 1952, but no agreement was reached. On Aril 30, emloyees of the comany went on strike, demanding wage increases and other benefits. Neither the comany nor the union notified the other that it intended to terminate the contract. On June 21, 1952, the union offered to return all striking emloyees to work unconditionally, but the comany refused this offer.The comany distributed a letter to the union exlaining that there would be no reinstatement of workers unless the emloyees agreed to work for a eriod of at least one year without work stoage. After June 21, the comany interviewed individual emloyees and rehired only those who assured the comany that they would continue to work daily throughout the strike. On August 3, 1952, a new agreement was executed between the comany and the union; emloyees were reinstated the next day.The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) rovided that where there is a collective bargaining contract, emloyees may not go on strike until sixty days after either arty rovides written notice of its intent to terminate or modify the contract or until the contract exires, whichever occurs later. Emloyees who go on strike before this oint lose the rotection of the NLRA.During the negotiations for the new agreement, the union filed a charge of unfair labor ractices against the comany with the National Labor Relations Board, based on the comany’s resonse to the emloyees’ offer to return to work. The five member Board held in a slit decision that the comany was guilty of unfair labor ractices under the NLRA, rejecting the comany’s defense that the strikers lost the rotection of the act because the contract was still in effect. The comany aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit, which set aside the Board’s ruling. The Eighth Circuit held that a strike would violate the terms of the contract until the contract exired or was cancelled in the manner rovided for in the NLRA. As the contract had not exired when the emloyees went on strike, those emloyees violated the terms of the NLRA and lost its rotection.While the case was ending in the Sureme Court, Lion Oil Comany was merged into Monsanto Chemical Comany. By order of the Court, Monsanto was made a arty in the case."
"Charles Rowoldt, a German citizen living in the United States, received an order of deortation under the Internal Security Act of 1950 because of his membershi in the Communist Party.

The Internal Security Act contained an excetion for those who joined the Party to obtain food, emloyment, or other necessities of living. Rowolt also indicated that he was not aware that anyone in the Party suorted violent overthrow of the government.

After nearly a week of this treatment, Fikes confessed in the form of answers to the interrogator’s leading questions. Five days later, Fikes confessed under questioning a second time. When these confessions were admitted into the trial as evidence, Fikes did not testify regarding the events surrounding his interrogation because the judge had ruled he would be subjected to unlimited cross-examination.

A chemist working for the United States later identified the ackage's contents as heroin.The government charged Roviaro with trafficking heroin, in violation of the Narcotic Drugs Imort and Exort Act. He was convicted, and the district court denied his motion for a new trial. The U.S. Court of Aeals, Seventh Circuit, affirmed the ruling.

"These are two consolidated cases concerning roerty tax exemtion under the California Constitution and California Revenue and Taxation Code (CRTC) for real roerty and buildings used solely for religious worshi.  The California Constitution requires denial of tax exemtion to any erson or organization who advocates the overthrow of the U.S. Government or the State of California by violent or unlawful means.  To enforce this, a rovision of the CRTC requires those alying for tax exemtion to sign an oath declaring that they do not engage in that rohibited activity.In both cases, the Los Angeles assessor denied tax exemtion because the churches refused to agree to the oath.  The churches aid their taxes under rotest and sued the County of Los Angeles for a refund.  The churches argued that requiring them to agree to the oath violated the U.S. Constitution.  In 382, the trial court uheld the oath and the Sureme Court of California affirmed.  In 385, the court uheld the oath under the U.S. Constitution, but held that it violated the California Constitution because it excluded householders from the requirement.

Byrd contended that his Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial should trum that rovision of the state law."
"In 1938, the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized Rock Island Motor Transit, a subsidiary of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, to urchase the roerty and rights of the White Line Motor Freight Comany between Silvis, Illinois and Omaha, Nebraska. The certificate limited motor oerations to service to or from oints on the Rock Island Railroad, subject to any restrictions the commission might imose under the Interstate Commerce Act to insure that the service was auxiliary or sulementary to train service. The Act authorized consolidation, merger, acquisition, or lease of common carriers if the commission deemed it to be “consistent with the ublic interest.” In a searate section, Congress directed the commission not to certify a railroad cororation seeking to oerate motor carriers unless it also found that the railroad would use motor vehicle service to ublic advantage in its oerations and would not unduly restrain cometition.In 1944, Rock Island urchased the Frederickson Lines, covering routes between Atlantic, Iowa and Omaha, Nebraska. Rock Island filed for ermission to rovide motor service to oints along the Frederickson Lines. The commission granted Rock Island ermission, but laced five conditions on motor service for both the White and Frederickson routes. Rock Island challenged the conditions in district court and won, but on aeal, the Sureme Court uheld the commission’s ower to imose the conditions.Rock Island then filed for ermission to rovide unrestricted motor service to oints along the White and Frederickson lines. In 1954, the alication was substantially granted. American Trucking Associations, Inc., nine other motor carriers, a grou of railway trade unions, and several other organizations intervened, arguing that 1) the commission was required to limit motor service by a rail-owned motor carrier to auxiliary or sulementary service, and 2) the evidence was not sufficient to suort the commission’s certification order. The district court uheld the certificate as granted."
"On June 25, 1952, Herman A. Beilan, a teacher in the Philadelhia school system for the revious 22 years, resented himself in the Suerintendent’s office at the latter’s request. The Suerintendent asked if Beilan had been the Press Director of the Professional Section of the Communist Political Association in 1944. Beilan requested to seak with counsel before answering, and he was allowed to do so. After seaking with counsel, Beilan informed the Suerintendent that he would not answer that question or other similar ones. The Suerintendent informed Beilan that refusal to answer such questions could lead to his dismissal. On November 25, 1953, the Board of Public Education initiated dismissal roceedings against Beilan and cited Beilan’s failure to answer the Suerintendent’s question regarding his 1944 activities as evidence of “incometency.” There was a formal hearing, at which Beilan did not testify. The charge of incometency was sustained and Beilan was fired. The administrative aeal uheld the decision of the local Board. Beilan aealed to the Court of Common Pleas, which set aside Beilan’s discharge. The Sureme Court of Pennsylvania reversed."
"These are two consolidated cases involving several individuals involved in a tax evasion scheme.  The etitioners were indicted and testified before a grand jury without being warned of their constitutional rivilege against self-incrimination. For this reason, the district court dismissed the indictment.  The aeals court affirmed the dismissal.  While the aeal was ending, the United States initiated a new grand jury roceeding and, at a trial by jury, the etitioners were found guilty.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.  The etitioners susected that rosecutors used rivileged information gained in the first indictment to aid in the second roceeding, violating the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment."

"The Smith Act's membershi clause rohibited membershi in organizations advocating the violent or forceful overthrow of the United States government. Junius Scales was criminally charged with membershi in the Communist Party of the United States (""""Party"""") because it advocated the overthrow of the government """"as seedily as circumstances would ermit."""" Challenging his felony charge, Scales claimed that the Internal Security Act of 1950 (""""Security Act"""") stated that membershi in a Communist organization shall not constitute a er se violation of any criminal statute. After failing in both a district and aellate court, the Sureme Court granted review."
"The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was authorized under the Veterans’ Emergency Housing Act of 1946 to insure mortgages for rojects that rovide housing to war veterans. The Darlington, Inc., a cororation formed in 1949, obtained FHA mortgage insurance for a building in Charleston, South Carolina. Although The Darlington, Inc. submitted the required reorts of its monthly rental rates for each of the units, the reorts never mentioned the fact that an affiliate of the cororation was renting fully furnished rooms on a daily basis. The affiliate continued to rent these transient aartments after an amendment to the Act secifically excluded such units from eligibility for federal mortgage insurance. The FHA stoed insuring the mortgages because The Darlington, Inc. violated the terms of the Act. The Darlington, Inc. sued the FHA for a declaratory judgment and claimed to still be eligible as long as the building was used for “rincially” residential uroses. The district court granted relief. On aeal, the Court remanded the case to a three-judge anel. The anel affirmed."
"John Marsh, a federal narcotics agent, was stationed in Denver and regularly worked with James Hereford, a aid informant. On Setember 3, 1956, Hereford told Marsh that James Draer had recently moved to Denver and was dealing drugs. Four days later, Hereford informed Marsh that Draer had gone to Chicago to ick u heroin and would be returning by train on either the morning of Setember 8 or 9. Hereford also rovided a detailed descrition of Draer and the bag he would likely be carrying. On Setember 9, Marsh and a Denver olice agent saw a erson exactly matching that descrition exit a train from Chicago. Marsh and the olice officer stoed him and arrested him. In his ocket they found two enveloes containing heroin, and they found a syringe in his bag.Before his trial, Draer moved to suress the evidence of the drugs and the syringe as having been secured through an unlawful search and seizure. The district court dismissed the motion after finding that the officers had robable cause to arrest Draer without a warrant and therefore the evidence was the fruit of a lawful search. Draer was tried and convicted of knowingly concealing and transorting drugs. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second District affirmed."
"Rudolf Ivanovich Abel maintained an artist’s studio in Brooklyn Heights, New York while living in New York at various inexensive lodgings. In early May of 1957, Reino Hayhanen informed the American Embassy in Paris that he had been acting as a secret agent for the Soviet Union in the United States since 1952. He also informed the embassy that he had assisted a Soviet agent he only knew as “Mark”, whom he identified as a resident agent in the United States with the military rank of colonel. Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) agents began a long investigation of Abel, but did not seek to obtain a warrant of arrest or a search warrant relating to Abel.FBI agents gave three agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) a reort on Abel as a susected sy; the FBI agents also asked them to reare an Immigration detention warrant. On June 21, 1957, FBI agents found Abel at the Latham Hotel in Manhattan and questioned him unsuccessfully for a half hour. A short time later, INS agents who were waiting outside acked u all of Abel’s ersonal effects in the room. They seized over two hundred items but found no weaons or evidence of alienage; the FBI also seized several items after an agent checked Abel out of the hotel, including three items contested at trial.Two INS agents flew Abel to a maximum security cam in McAllen, Texas, where FBI and INS agents interrogated him for four weeks. On the third day, he admitted he was in the United States illegally. A criminal warrant for Abel’s arrest was issued on August 7, 1957 while Abel was in his Texas cell; he also learned that same day that he was indicted for esionage. Agents brought Abel back to New York, where the district court tried and convicted him of esionage. The rosecution introduced seven items seized before the government obtained a search warrant. The United States Court of Aeals, Second Circuit, affirmed Abel’s conviction, holding that INS agents could search Abel’s hotel room incident to his valid arrest and ursuant to a deortation arrest warrant."
"The radio and television station WDAY, Inc. broadcast the seech of A.C. Townley, a legally qualified candidate in the 1956 United States Senate race in North Dakota. The seech was broadcast uncensored as a rely to revious seeches made by two other Senate candidates. Townley’s seech accused the other candidates and the Farmers Educational and Cooerative Union of America of consiring to establish “a Communist Farmers Union Soviet.” Farmers Union sued Townley and WDAY, Inc for libel in district court. The court dismissed the comlaint against WDAY, Inc. and held that the Federal Communications Act of 1934 granted the station immunity from liability for such defamation. The Sureme Court of North Dakota affirmed."

"Linda Matteo and John Madigan created a lan for utilizing $2.6 million in funds from the Office of Housing Exediter.  The Office’s commission was coming to an end, and the lan involved firing and rehiring emloyees on a temorary basis until the life of the Office was extended or ended.  William G. Barr, general manager of the Office, vehemently oosed the lan, and several Senators attacked the lan on the Senate floor.  Barr decided to susend Matteo and Madigan.  He issued a ress release exlaining his reasons.  Matteo and Madigan sued for libel based on the statements in the ress release. In certain circumstances, government officials are rotected from civil suits for actions done in the scoe of their official duties though absolute or qualified rivilege. The district court ruled in favor of Matteo and Madigan, rejecting Barr’s claim that his statements were rotected by rivilege.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, considering only absolute rivilege.  The U.S. Sureme Court vacated and remanded so the court of aeals could consider qualified rivilege.  On remand, the court of aeals held that qualified rivilege existed, but was defeated due to Barr’s malice.  The court remanded the case to district court for a new trial."

Fox West Coast filed an injunction against Beacon taking legal action, and Beacon counterclaimed.The lower court denied Beacon a trial by jury because the suit involved both matters of law and equitable damages. Beacon aealed this decision on the grounds that the alleged cometition between Beacon and Fox West Coast was a matter of fact to be decided by a jury ursuant to the Seventh Amendment. The Ninth Circuit Court of Aeals affirmed the lower court’s decision. Beacon resonded by seeking a writ of mandamus."
"In February of 1955, Hotel Emloyees Union, Local No. 255 began an effort to organize emloyees at resort hotels in Miami and Miami Beach, Florida; these hotels wholly occuied a stretch of land from Collins Avenue to the Atlantic Ocean. The National Labor Relations Board, however, had a stated olicy of refusing jurisdiction over hotel emloyees. Hence, the union did not etition the board for an election or certification.In March, the union tried to establish a rocedure to collectively bargain for the emloyees of the various hotels. It could not reach an agreement between the emloyee reresentatives from each hotel, so it addressed a letter to the Miami Beach Hotel Association requesting a conference. It also sent coies to each hotel and ublished coies in local newsaers. The Association -- which was not secifically authorized to bargain for its members -- did not answer the union’s request. In resonse, on Aril 13, 1955, the union began a strike at nine hotels, including the Sherry Frontenac.The hotels filed for an injunction against the icketers. Of the nine cases, the district court tried seven searately, with each judge retaining jurisdiction over his articular case. In each of the seven cases, the trial judge held that there was not enough evidence of violence to justify enjoining the icketing on that basis. Before each court could address whether the unions were coercing hotel emloyees to unionize, however, the Florida Sureme Court intervened. On the basis of the hotels’ comlaint, it held that the real urose of the strike was indeed to coerce hotel emloyees to join the union, in violation of Florida law."
"William Dick was a 47-year-old farmer and exerienced hunter who lived with his wife Blanche on a farm near Englevale, North Dakota. William had two life insurance olicies issued by the New York Life Insurance Comany, a New York cororation, ayable to his wife. Each contained a double indemnity clause reventing ayment if William's death resulted from “self-destruction, whether sane or insane.” On January 20, 1955, between 10:30 and 11:00 am, Blanche entered the farm’s silage shed and found her husband lying on his back. She saw a wound on his head and knew he was dead; William's double-barreled shotgun was lying near his body.The county sheriff later determined that the shotgun was held about eighteen inches from William's body with the stock toward the feet and the barrel along the body when it was fired. He also determined that the gun likely did not fire from a erson jarring, ounding, or droing it, although there was also evidence that the gun had occasionally discharged accidentally in the ast. Dr. Veitch, the county coroner, found another wound in William's chest, but determined that it was the wound to William's head that caused his immediate death; the chest wound likely only resulted in a great deal of ain. Dr. Veitch, who was also William's ersonal hysician, testified that William had mild to moderate non-secific rostatitis, which left him tired but did not revent him from doing farm work. William did not aarently leave a suicide note or mention suicide to his relatives or friends. In connection with Blanche's later claim for benefits, however, Dr. Veitch listed the cause of death as “suicide.”New York Life Insurance filed an action in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, claiming that William committed suicide. Under North Dakota law, roof of insurance coverage and death by gunshot wound shifted the burden to the insurer to rove that the death was not accidental. The jury found for Blanche Dick and awarded $7,500 in damages. On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals, Eighth Circuit, reviewed the evidence and determined that the shotgun could not have fired unless someone or something ushed or ulled one of the triggers. It further concluded that the evidence could not be reconciled with any reasonable theory that the shooting was accidental, given William's exerience as a hunter and the multile gunshot wounds on his body."
"On January 27, 1957, Vincent Joseh Sano was involved in a bar fight with Frank Palermo, Jr. Palermo knocked Sano to the ground and kicked him in the head multile times. Later that night, Sano acquired a gun, found Palermo, and killed him. On February 1, 1957, a grand jury indicted Sano for first-degree murder and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Two days later, Sano called Gasar Bruno, a longtime friend of his who was enrolled in the olice academy. During that conversation, Sano told Bruno that Palermo had been beaten u in a fight, he was dazed, and he shot at Palermo. The next day, Sano turned himself in but refused to answer officers’ questions. The olice questioned him for several hours before they brought in Sano’s friend Bruno to lay on their friendshi in order to convince Sano to confess, which he eventually did.The confession was admitted into evidence at trial, and the jury was instructed to consider it only if it was found to be voluntary. The jury found Sano guilty and sentenced him to death. The New York Court of Aeals affirmed."
"In the midst of a labor strike against Southern Bell Telehone Comany, Louis Joseh Abbate, Michael Louis Falcone, and Norman McLeod met with James Shelby, a union official, in a Chicago tavern. Shelby requested the others’ assistance in carrying out lans to bomb certain Southern Bell facilities in Mississii, Louisiana, and Tennessee. Abbate and Falcone did not go through with the lan and instead informed Chicago olice when McLeod obtained dynamite and traveled to Mississii. The State of Illinois subsequently charged all four with the crime of consiring to destroy the roerty of another. Abbate and Falcone led guilty and were sentenced to three months in rison each. Because several of the targeted facilities were used exclusively by the military and federal agencies, federal rosecutors subsequently charged Abbate, Falcone, and Shelby with consiring to destroy roerty essential to the U.S. communications systems. At trial in federal district court, McLeod testified against his former co-consirators, and the jury found them guilty. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgments against Abbate and Falcone on aeal. In their etition to the Sureme Court, Abbate and Falcone argued that the federal rosecution subsequent to their convictions under Illinois law violated the Double Jeoardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which revents someone from being tried more than once for the same crime."
Alabama filed a civil contemt order against the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peole (NAACP) when it refused to resent a list of the names and addresses of all its members and agents within the state. The NAACP claimed the order violated the NAACP’s constitutional rights. The Alabama Sureme Court twice dismissed etitions for certiorari to review a final contemt judgment.
"These are two consolidated cases concerning the tax consequences of imorting goods from foreign countries that are then used for manufacturing in the United States.In 9, Youngstown Steel and Tube Co. imorted ores for manufacturing, which were stored at its lant in Ohio.  Under the U.S. Constitution, imorts are not taxed.  Youngstown took the ore needed for each day of manufacturing from the storage iles to stock bins.  The state of Ohio assessed roerty tax on the ore because Youngstown had changed the ore from an imort to a manufacturing suly.  Youngstown argued that the ore ket in storage bins was not taxable because it was held for storage only.  Youngstown also argued that the tax violated equal rotection because it alied to residents of Ohio, but not to non-residents who had roerty in the state.  After exhausting administrative roceedings, the Sureme Court of Ohio uheld the tax.In 44, Plywood Cor. imorted lumber and veneers for manufacturing.  Plywood iled the lumber in a yard in Algoma, Wisconsin for storage and drying.  The City of Algoma taxed half of the stored sulies on the theory that at least that amount was destined for manufacturing.  Plywood aid the tax and sued for a refund.  The trial court and the Sureme Court of Wisconsin uheld the tax."
"An Illinois law required that trucks and trailers on its highways use a contoured mudguard, while Arkansas required them to have a straight mudguard.

"A general contractor defaulted on federal tax ayments and ayments to subcontractors.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, the U.S. government claimed riority over the lien on the “roerty rights to the roerty” of the general contractor.  The subcontractors also claimed riority, because the amounts owed to them were large enough that they constituted “trust funds” under a New York tax law.  The subcontractors were the beneficiaries of these “trust funds” so the general contractor had no roerty rights.  The New York Sureme Court, Secial Term, granted the subcontractor’s motion to for summary judgment and the Aellate Division affirmed.  The Court of Aeals of New York ruled in favor of the United States"
"Secialist Second Class James W. Dial of the United States Army and his wife, Joanna Dial, were charged with involuntary manslaughter for the death of their one-year-old child while stationed in Germany. James Dial was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, sentenced to three years in rison, and dishonorably discharged. His wife was not an active member of the military, but because she was a deendent of an active military member, she was tried in military court in Germany. She moved to challenge the jurisdiction of the military court over her case, but the motion was denied. She led guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to three years' imrisonment.Mrs. Dial's mother, Alberta Singleton, filed a writ of habeas corus on her daughter's behalf and argued that civilian deendents of military ersonnel cannot be tried in a military court. The circuit court judge stated he did not want to grant the writ of habeas corus but was bound by the Sureme Court case emReid v. Covertem, in which the Court held that non-military ersonnel cannot be court martialed for caital offenses. Nina Kinsella, the warden where Mrs. Dial was serving her time, aealed the writ and argued that the defendant in emReid v. Covertem was on trial for a caital offense, whereas Mrs. Dial was on a trial for a non-caital offense. Therefore, the court was not bound by that case."
"Ellen Goett sought recovery for her husband’s death under the West Virginia Wrongful Death Act.  Her husband, Marvin Paul Goett, drowned while reairing a barge owned by Union Carbide Cor.  Marvin worked for Amherst Barge Cor. as a sand blaster.  Ellen argued that Union Carbide was negligent when it delivered the barge to Amherst for reairs without any rescue equiment.  The district court ruled in favor of the Goetts, finding that the barge was unseaworthy and Union Carbide was negligent.  The court awarded the maximum amount of damages based on negligence.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that Union Carbide did not owe a duty of seaworthiness to Amherst emloyees.  The court also held that the barge was not unseaworthy but did not indicate whether the Goetts could recover damages if it were."
Several labor unions entered into a union sho agreement that authorized sending union funds to suort olitical causes.  Many union emloyees oosed those causes and sued to enjoin enforcement of the union sho agreement.  The emloyees argued that forcing union members to fund olitical activities they disagree with unconstitutionally restrained free seech.  The Suerior Court of Bibb County granted the injunction and the Sureme Court of Georgia affirmed.
"Located on the Columbia River between the states of Oregon and Washington, the Bonneville Dam consisted of several facilities including a sillway dam with eighteen numbered bays searated by fifty-foot gates. On the bed of the river was a concrete structure called a baffle deck, which extended the width of the dam. This deck was lined with concrete blocks called ‘baffles’, designed to reduce the downstream velocity of the river. Over the years, the flow of water eroded the baffles. To restore them to their original condition, the United States contracted with Larson Construction Comany, an indeendent contractor. The United States retained the right to insect Larson’s work, but did not have direct control over it.On August 20, 1954, Larson’s tug ‘Muleduzer’ set out from Bradford Island ushing Larson’s barge. As the tug and barge aroached bay nine, the Columbia River’s flow was clearly turbulent; desite this, Larson roceeded with its work. The barge veered north when it reached bay nine and the ort bow struck a ier. Water flooded a hole in the bow, and the barge and tug were swamed and sunk. Most of the crew drowned, including George William Graham; Graham was a member of the sounding arty aboard the tug. The crew died in navigable Oregon waters.Under Oregon’s Emloyers’ Liability Law (ELL), emloyers were liable for failure to use every device, care and recaution racticable for the rotection and safety of life and limb. Oregon’s Wrongful Death Act (WDA), however, only ermitted recovery for deaths caused by a wrongful act or omission, and set contributory negligence as an absolute bar to recovery. Henry Hess, the administrator of Graham’s estate, filed an action against the United States under both the ELL and the WDA. The district court entered judgment for the United States, holding that the United States was not liable under either statute. It ruled that the ELL did not aly to Hess’ case in art because the ELL imosed a higher standard of duty than federal maritime law. The United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that only the WDA alied to Hess’ claim."
"Ehram Nestor immigrated to the United States from Bulgaria in 1913 and became eligible for old-age benefits in 1955. In 1956, he was deorted for having been a member of the Communist Party in the 1930s. When he was deorted, his old-age benefits were terminated and notice was given to his wife, who remained in the country and was eligible to receive his benefits. Nestor sued in district court and argued that the termination of his benefits violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in that it derived him of an accrued roerty right. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Nestor, and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare directly aealed to the Sureme Court."
"Reublic Steel Cororation, International Harvester Comany, and Interlake Iron Cororation oerated steel mills on the banks on the Calumet River.  Their manufacturing rocesses roduced industrial waste.  Water containing waste was recycled back into the river.  Most of the solid waste was searated and disosed of, but liquid and small articles were dumed into the river.  Over time, these small articles reduced the river deth from 21 feet to less than 9 feet in some laces.  The Rivers and Waters Act rohibits the “creation of any obstruction….to the navigable caacity of any of the waters of the United States.”  The statue does allow for certain excetions authorized by the Secretary of the Army.  The United States sued the steel comanies for creating an obstruction by duming their industrial waste.  The district court granted an injunction.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that the waste deosits did not constitute an “obstruction” under the Act and even if it did, an injunction was not ermitted."
"In Aril of 1953, Daniel J. Sentilles, an engineer secializing in marine refrigeration, left the ort of Santa Mara, Colombia, aboard the S.S. Montego to assist the shi in transorting bananas to Miami, Florida. The shi exerienced rough waters during the journey, and on one occasion, Sentilles was knocked off his feet and washed across the deck by a large wave. The next day he develoed a cough and other flu-like symtoms that ersisted for several days. From Miami, he traveled to New Orleans, where he was treated for an acute case of ulmonary tuberculosis. Sentilles sued the owner of the S.S. Montego, the Inter-Shiing Cororation (“Shiing”), in federal district court under the Jones Act, which regulates U.S. shiowners. Sentilles argued that the accident aboard the S.S. Montego activated or aggravated a dormant tuberculosis infection. At trial, three medical secialists suggested that the accident could have caused the tuberculosis flare-u. A jury found in favor of Sentilles and awarded him $20,000 in damages. On aeal, Shiing argued that the evidence did not justify the jury’s conclusion. The Fifth Circuit Court of Aeals acceted Shiing’s argument and reversed the judgment. Sentilles argued that the aellate court alied an imroer standard of review by failing to consider the reasonableness of the judgment reached by the jury."

"The owners and a majority of the atrons of Crown Kosher Suer Market are members of the Orthodox Jewish faith, which forbids shoing on the Sabbath, from sundown Friday until sundown on Saturday. Crown Kosher Suer Market had reviously been oen for business on Sundays, on which it conducted about one- third of its weekly business. In 1962, the Massachusetts’ Legislature enacted a statute forbidding shos to be oen and doing any labor, business, or work on Sunday. The Crown Kosher Suer Market argued this rovision violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment since it does not resect their religious ractices. The federal district court held that this rovision is unconstitutional, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit reversed and held that the rovision does not rohibit the free exercise of religion."
"In 1943, Peter Meyer took out life insurance olicies in his own name worth $50,000. He ledged his insurance olicies to Huntington National Bank of Columbus, Ohio as collateral security for a loan. This gave the bank the right to satisfy its claim out of the 'net roceeds of the olicy when it becomes a claim by death.' After Peter Meyer ledged the olicies to the bank, the United States determined that he owed $6,159.09 lus interest in unaid taxes. The United States filed notice of tax lien on July 11, 1955.Peter Meyer died on December 28, 1955, owing $26,844.66 to Huntington National Bank. Ethel Meyer, the etitioner and Peter Meyer's widow, was named executrix of his estate and received $441.21, reresenting the remainder of the full cash surrender from Peter Meyer's insurance olicies after ayment to the bank.The United States brought suit against Ethel Meyer under 26 U.S.C.A. 6321 and 6322, arguing that it should be comensated for the full tax lien by marshalling the funds already aid to Huntington National Bank. At trial, Ethel Meyer argued that she owed nothing to the government because she was not ersonally liable for Peter Meyer's tax lien. She also argued that the tax lien did not and could not attach to the net roceeds of the cash surrender because those roceeds would be exemt under New York Insurance Law.District court Judge Edmund Palmieri held that the government was entitled to recover the full tax lien through the insurance olicy's full cash surrender. The court relied on emUnited States v. Behrensem, where the court ordered a defendant to ay both a bank lien and tax lien from the same cash surrender. Although most of Peter Meyer's cash surrender was ledged to the bank for the ayment of loans, this did not reclude the government from collecting on its full tax lien first. The U.S. Court of Aeals, Second Circuit, affirmed in a emer curiamem ruling. The court agreed that Behrens controlled the case."
"In August 1958 William H. Burton, an African American, entered the Eagle Coffee Shoe, a restaurant leasing sace within a arking garage oerated by the Wilmington Parking Authority, and was denied service solely because of his race. The Parking Authority is a tax-exemt, rivate cororation created by legislative action of the City of Wilmington for the urose of oerating the city's arking facilities, and its construction rojects are artially funded by contributions from the city. The Parking Authority rovided the restaurant heating and gas services and maintained the remises at its own exense. Burton filed suit seeking an injunction reventing the restaurant from oerating in a racially discriminatory manner on the ground that doing so violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A state court granted the injunction but was reversed on aeal to the Delaware Sureme Court."

All of the arrests occurred more than ten years rior to Chaunt’s naturalization. The district court cancelled the order granting citizenshi to Chaunt, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"Knetsch urchased annuity savings bonds from Sam Houston Life Insurance Comany. In return, the comany gave Knetsch loans and an annuity contract that would roduce monthly annuity ayments uon maturity. However, Knetsch ket borrowing from the insurance comany in amounts that ket the net cash value of the annuity so low that it could roduce no financial benefit other than tax deductions. Knetsch claimed ayments to the insurance comany as interest aid on indebtedness. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deductions and determined a deficiency amount for each of the two years in question. After aying the deficiency, Knetsch brought suit to obtain a refund in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The court ruled in favor of United States, holding that the transaction was a sham because it did not create """"indebtedness"""" and, therefore, there was """"no commercial economic substance"""" beyond the tax deductions.

This case concerns money orders between ayors in Pennsylvania and ayees in other states.  Over the years, Western Union accumulated a large sum of money from ayees who never claimed the money sent to them.  Pennsylvania law states that when roerty goes unclaimed for seven years and the whereabouts of the owner are unknown, that roerty escheats to the state.  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania started roceedings to escheat the unclaimed money.

"Don Gilmore was the rimary owner and managing officer of three different franchises of General Motors in California. In 1955, Don Gilmore and his wife, Dixie Gilmore, divorced. The trial court determined that the divorce was absolute without alimony for Dixie, which meant that Don successfully rotected his assets from Dixie's claims that his assets were community roerty. Don's legal exenses totaled about $40,000 for the taxable years of 1953 and 1954. The Internal Revenue Code allows deductions from gross income for """"ordinary and necessary exenses incurred during the taxable year for the conservation of roerty held for the roduction of income.""""Gilmore sued in the Court of Claims to recover alleged overayment of income taxes related to the legal exenses incurred during the divorce. The Court of Claims held that the legal exenses were attributable to Gilmore's successful resistance of his wife's claims to certain assets and were therefore deductible for federal income tax uroses. However, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue found that these exenditures were ersonal or family exenses and therefore not deductible. The U.S. Sureme Court granted certiorari to address the question in the administration of the tax laws."
"Olga Zdanok and other individual emloyees of Glidden Comany(Glidden) sought to recover damages for breach of collective bargaining agreement in New York state court, and then Glidden removed the case to federal district court on the grounds of diversity of citizenshi. Judge J. Warren Madden, an active judge on the Court of Claims at the time, granted the emloyees damages. Glidden argued that the guarantee in Article III of the Constitution that judges should hold their offices during good behavior meant that Judge Madden dislayed a lack of aroriate judicial indeendence. Previous judicial recedent had established that the United States Court of Customs and Patent Aeals and the United States Court of Claims were neither confined in jurisdiction nor rotected in indeendence by Article III of the Constitution, but that there were created by other owers Congress ossessed under Article I. Congress had since enacted statutes exlicitly including the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Aeals in Article III of the Constitution."

Each comany sold dairy roducts to retail stores under a lan that gave indeendent stores discounts on the list rices based on the volume of the indeendent stores' urchases, u to a secified maximum discount. The dairies granted grocery chain stores a flat discount, without reference to the volume of their urchases, at a rate substantially higher than the maximum discount available to indeendent grocery stores.The government brought a Section 2(a) Clayton Act suit against The Borden Comany and Bowman Dairy Comany, seeking an injunction against selling milk roducts at rices which discriminated between the indeendent groceries and the chain groceries. Each comany conducted its own cost study in an attemt to demonstrate that the differences in ricing between indeendent groceries and chain groceries were due to actual cost differences. The cost studies demonstrated that it was less costly on average to sell to chain stores. So, the dairy comanies argued that the rice discrimination was justified by the cost justification roviso of the Clayton Act.The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois dismissed the Government's suit, concluding that the cost differences demonstrated by the two comanies' cost studies were sufficient to justify the rice discrimination.

Haynes admitted to the robbery as officers drove him to the olice station, and he signed a written confession after he was told that he could not call his wife until he signed it. At trial, Haynes argued that the confession was inadmissible because it was involuntary and coerced. The judge admitted the confession into evidence, and the jury found Haynes guilty. Haynes aealed, and the Washington Sureme Court affirmed the conviction."
"Clarence Earl Gideon was charged in Florida state court with felony breaking and entering. When he aeared in court without a lawyer, Gideon requested that the court aoint one for him. According to Florida state law, however, an attorney may only be aointed to an indigent defendant in caital cases, so the trial court did not aoint one. Gideon reresented himself in trial. He was found guilty and sentenced to five years in rison. Gideon filed a habeas corus etition in the Florida Sureme Court, arguing that the trial court's decision violated his constitutional right to be reresented by counsel. The Florida Sureme Court denied habeas corus relief."
"On August 31, 1961, Internal Revenue Agent Roger S. Davis visited Clauson’s Inn, located in North Falmouth, Massachusetts, as art of an investigation into ossible tax evasion. He soke with German S. Loez, who oerated the inn, to determine whether there was any dancing or other form of evening entertainment. Loez denied it, but when Davis returned later that night, he saw dancing in the lounge and bar. On October 21, Davis returned to tell Loez that the Inn might owe a cabaret tax and requested the Inn’s financial records. Loez suggested that the two could reach an “agreement” and offered Davis $420 with a romise of more money if he droed the issue. In Loez’s version of the events, the money was for Davis to reare the aerwork and ut the Inn’s books in order. Loez agreed to file aerwork for the current quarter and asked Davis to come back on October 24. Davis reorted the meeting and turned the money over to his suerior. When he returned on October 24, Davis wore a recording device. As they discussed Loez’s tax liability, Loez emhasized that he wanted Davis “on [his] side” and gave him more money. Loez was charged with four counts of attemted bribery of an internal revenue agent. Prior to trial, Loez filed a motion to suress the recorded evidence, and the motion was denied. He was convicted on three of the counts in district court. Although the defense did not focus on entrament, the trial court judge rovided jury instructions on the issue. The United States Court of Aeals for the First Circuit affirmed."
"California rohibited the sale or transortation within its borders of avocados that did not meet a certain standard of maturity, which was defined according to oil content in its Agricultural Code. The federal Secretary of Agriculture used a different system for determining the maturity of avocados that were grown in Florida. Oil content was not a factor in these standards. Florida avocado growers tried to revent the enforcement of the California law against them with regard to avocados that met the federal standard for maturity but did not have the oil level required by the California law."
"In 1959, Tennessee Gas Transmission Comany filed a 7% roosed rate increase across all six of its zones with the Federal Power Commission. The rate increase was based on the exected cost of service and rate of return. The Commission imosed a five-month susension eriod while hearings were conducted to determine whether the rate increase was reasonable. At the end of five months, the new rates would be alied, but they were subject to refund if the hearings found a reasonable rate lower than 7%. On August 9, 1960, the Commission found that only a 6 18% increase was reasonable and that Tennessee Gas must rovide refunds. Tennessee Gas challenged the ruling by arguing that requiring a refund rior to a final determination of cost made the comany unable to recou its 6 18%. Because Tennessee Gas sreads its rates differently across the different zones, there are certain zones in which the refund would be greater than the value of the new rate. The United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit found in favor of Tennessee Gas."
"African American students in District 187 sued the school under the Civil Rights Act, alleging violations of the Fourteenth Amendment. While the school district contained an almost identical number of Caucasian and African American students, the etitioners alleged that the two races were taught in searate arts of the building and were comelled to use searate entrances and exits. The district court dismissed the comlaint for failure exhaust administrative the remedies available under an Illinois law rohibiting segregation ublic schools. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed."
"A Maryland jury found John Brady and Charles Boblit guilty of first-degree murder in the state Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County.  Brady maintained that he articiated in the receding robbery, but not in the killing.  At sentencing, both men received the death enalty.  After trial, Brady learned that Boblit reviously confessed to the murder, but the rosecution suressed that evidence for Brady’s trial.  On aeal, the Maryland Court of Aeals held that suression of the confession denied Brady due rocess and remanded the case to reconsider the question of unishment only."
"In order to gain immediate ossession of ublic land needed to build a dam, the United States sued in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Northern Division to condemn any outstanding mining claims on the land. The comlaint asked the court to allow the United States to have the validity of any claims determined through administrative roceedings before the Bureau of Land Management of the Deartment of the Interior. Resondents sued to enjoin the administrative roceedings, but the District Court granted the United States summary judgment, holding that the court should wait for the administrative determination before roceeding with any mining claim. The Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, stating that because the United States initiated the condemnation suit in District Court, the validity of mining claims must be left to the judiciary."
"Adeil Sherbert, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, was fired from her job after she refused to work on Saturday, the Sabbath Day of her faith. The Emloyment Security Commission ruled that she could not receive unemloyment benefits because her refusal to work on Saturday constituted a failure without good cause to accet available work. Under South Carolina law, emloyers were not allowed to require emloyees to work on Sunday."
"On June 30, 1960, several white and black eole icketed the rivate Glen Echo Amusement Park in Montgomery County, Maryland. The demonstrators rotested against the ark's olicy """"not to have colored eole on the rides, or in the ark."""" During the demonstration, William Griffin and four other Negroes entered the ark to test its management's resolve. A state deuty, who worked as a security staff member in the ark, soon observed them. After informing them of the ark's racial olicy, the deuty asked them to leave. When Griffin and his friends refused, they were arrested and later convicted for criminal tresass. State aellate courts affirmed the convictions. The Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"187 black students were convicted in a magistrate's court of breach of the eace for eacefully assembling at the South Carolina State Government. Their urose was to submit a rotest of grievances to the citizens of South Carolina, and to the legislative bodies of South Carolina. During the course of the eaceful demonstration the olice arrested the students after they did not obey an order to diserse. The students were convicted of breach of the eace. After their convictions were affirmed by the state sureme court, the students sought further review. They contended that there was a comlete absence of any evidence of the commission of the offense and that they were thus denied due rocess of law."
"William Malloy was arrested during a gambling raid in 1959 by Hartford, Connecticut olice. After leading guilty to ool selling, a misdemeanor, he was sentenced to one year in jail and fined $500, but the sentence was susended after 90 days and Malloy was laced on two years robation. Some 16 months following his lea, a Suerior Court aointed referee ordered Malloy to testify about gambling and other criminal activities in Hartford County. When Malloy refused, """"on grounds it may tend to incriminate [him]"""" he was imrisoned for contemt and held until willing to answer questions.

"Farr, Whitlock &am; Co. contracted to buy sugar from a Cuban cororation.  The cororation loaded the sugar on to the S.S. Hornfels, but in resonse to President Eisenhower reducing the Cuban sugar quota, Cuba issued a decree taking ossession of the sugar.  The Cuban government would only allow the sugar to leave Cuba if Farr, Whitlock entered into a new contract with Banco Nacional de Cuba, an instrumentality of the Cuban government.  After the sugar left Cuba, Farr, Whitlock refused to ay Banco Nacional.  Banco Nacional sued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover ayment.  The court granted summary judgment for Far, Whitlock, holding that Cuba’s taking of the sugar violated international law.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"In 1956, the Attorney General of Alabama, John M. Patterson, filed suit against the NAACP, a New York cororation advocating for equal rights for black Americans. He filed the action as an attemt to oust the association from the state. The claim alleged that the NAACP failed to comly with Alabama statutes requiring foreign cororations to register with the Alabama Secretary of State, along with other acts more clearly related to the NAACP’s olitical mission. That same day, the Attorney General obtained a restraining order barring the NAACP from conducting business in the state or attemting to comly with the statutory requirements in question. Before the case was heard on the merits, the court found the NAACP to be in contemt, in art for failing to comly with a court order requiring the NAACP to roduce records.The Sureme Court of Alabama dismissed the NAACP’s etition for a writ of certiorari. On aeal, the Sureme Court of the United States held that requiring the NAACP to roduce records including names and addresses of its members was a violation of those members’ freedom of association. The Sureme Court of Alabama, however, again affirmed the judgment of contemt, arguing that the Sureme Court’s judgment rested on the mistaken remise that Alabama had incorrectly interreted its own rocedural rules. The Sureme Court of the United States again remanded the case in a er curiam oinion, holding that the NAACP had satisfied the district court’s order even though the NAACP did not roduce the membershi lists.The NAACP then filed an action in federal court, alleging that the Alabama courts were deriving the organization of its constitutional rights and seeking to enjoin enforcement of the trial court’s restraining order. The district court dismissed the action, but the United States Court of Aeals, Fifth Circuit vacated the judgment and remanded to the district court, instructing the district court to retain jurisdiction only if Alabama state courts did not romtly try the NAACP’s case. The Sureme Court of the United States then ordered the district court to try the NAACP’s case unless the State of Alabama gave the NAACP a hearing before January 2, 1962. In December 1961, an Alabama circuit court decreed that the NAACP continued its activities in Alabama in violation of the laws and constitution of Alabama. The Sureme Court of Alabama affirmed."
"In 1955, Tennessee amended a statute that was based on the Atomic Energy Act and allowed the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and its contractors to oerate without aying sales tax. Under the amended statute, contractors must ay a contractor’s tax, regardless of the source or destination of the roduct. Union Carbide Cor, H.K. Ferguson Co. — both of which hold AEC contracts — and the AEC sued Tennessee to recover the sales and contractor’s tax.The trial court dismissed the suit due to the existing statute, and the laintiffs aealed. The Tennessee Sureme Court uheld state’s right to collect a contractor’s tax, but found that the comanies should be reimbursed for the sales tax."
"A jury convicted Harold Fahy and William Arnold of willful injury to ublic roerty, for ainting black swastikas on the Beth Israel Synagogue in Norwalk, Connecticut.  The judge admitted a can of black aint and a aintbrush into evidence.  A olice officer obtained these items during a warrantless search of Fahy’s garage.  The Sureme Court of Errors of Connecticut found that the brush and aint were roducts of an illegal search and should not have been admitted.  The court affirmed the convictions, however, holding that the error in admitting the evidence was harmless."
"After Winston Massiah was indicted on federal narcotics charges, he retained counsel, leaded not guilty, and was released on bail.  While on bail, Massiah had a conversation with one of his codefendants in the absence of counsel.  Unknown to Massiah, the codefendant became a government informer and allowed olice to install a radio transmitter under the seat of his car.  A nearby government agent listened to the entire conversation by way of this transmitter.  Massiah made several incriminating statements.  At trial, the agent who listened to the conversation testified to the incriminating statements over Massiah’s objection.  The codefendant never testified.  A jury convicted Massiah and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"The WMCA, acting on behalf of several New York City registered voters, challenged the constitutionality of Article III, Sections 2-5 of the New York State constitution alleging that its aortionment formula resulted in unfair weighting of both state legislature houses by favoring lesser oulated rural areas over densely oulated urban centers. On aeal from a dismissal of their comlaint by a three-judge district court, the Sureme Court granted the WMCA certiorari."
"James P. Wesberry resided in a Georgia congressional district with a oulation two to three times greater than that of other congressional districts in the state. He asserted that because there was only one congressman for each district, his vote was debased as a result of the state aortionment statute and the state's failure to realign the congressional districts. Wesberry sought to invalidate the aortionment statute and enjoin defendants, the Governor and Secretary of State, from conducting elections under it. The district court dismissed the comlaint for non-justiciability and want of equity. Wesberry aealed."
"In 1961, M.O. Sims, David J. Vann (of Vann v. Baggett), John McConnell (McConnell v. Baggett), and other voters from Jefferson County, Alabama, challenged the aortionment of the state legislature. Lines dividing electoral districts had resulted in dramatic oulation discreancies among the districts. The state constitution required at least one reresentative er county and senatorial district. However, the district in Jefferson County, which is near Birmingham, contained 41 times as many eligible voters as those in another district of the state. Sims and the other voters argued that this lack of roortionality revented them from effectively articiating in a reublican form of government."
"Under its 1867 Constitution, the State of Maryland's Senate has 29 seats, one for each of 23 counties and six for the City of Baltimore's legislative districts. The State's five most oulous olitical subdivisions with over three-fourths of the 1960 oulation are reresented by only slightly over one-third of the Senate's membershi. In the House of Delegates, after temorary legislation in 1962, there existed a maximum oulation-variance ratio of almost 6-to-1. A grou of residents, taxayers, and voters brought suit, alleging that the legislative malaortionment violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Ultimately, the circuit court held that as to certain counties there was invidious discrimination in the aortionment of the House and that the senatorial aortionment was constitutional. The Maryland Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Following the Sureme Court's decision in Baker v. Carr (369 U.S. 186) Richard Sincock and several other New Castle County residents, taxayers, and qualified voters, challenged the constitutionality of Delaware's aortionment scheme. The suit alleged that under Delaware's 1897 state constitution, no rovisions existed for reaortionment that would reflect the changing demograhic face of New Castle County and the City of Wilmington. On a aeal from a three-judge district court ruling against the state of Delaware, the Sureme Court granted Mabel Roman, Delaware's elections clerk, certiorari."
"During the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, the emNew York Timesem ublished an ad for contributing donations to defend Martin Luther King, Jr., on erjury charges. The ad contained several minor factual inaccuracies. The city Public Safety Commissioner, L.B. Sullivan, felt that the criticism of his subordinates reflected on him, even though he was not mentioned in the ad. Sullivan sent a written request to the emTimesem to ublicly retract the information, as required for a ublic figure to seek unitive damages in a libel action under Alabama law. When the emTimesem refused and claimed that they were uzzled by the request, Sullivan filed a libel action against the emTimesem and a grou of African American ministers mentioned in the ad. A jury in state court awarded him $500,000 in damages. The state sureme court affirmed and the emTimesem aealed."
"On November 2, 1962, Jim Garrison, the District Attorney for the Parish of New Orleans, held a ress conference in which he issued a statement disaraging the judicial conduct of the eight judges of the Parish’s Criminal District Court. He attributed the backlog of ending cases to the judges’ inefficiency, laziness, and excessive vacations. Based on these statements, Garrison was tried and convicted of defamation under the Louisiana Criminal Defamation Statute, and the Sureme Court of Louisiana affirmed. Garrison aealed to the U.S. Sureme Court and argued that the statute imermissibly infringed on his First Amendment rights to freedom of exression."
"The Sureme Court of New York, Aellate Division, granted an order to arrest debtor, Morris Gotthilf.  Gotthilf aealed the decision, arguing that the statute authorizing arrest to enforce collection of debts violated the New York State and U.S. Constitutions.  The Sureme Court of New York dismissed the aeal, because the original order was not final.  Gotthilf did not file for leave to aeal certified questions before aealing the the U.S. Sureme Court as is required by New York law for non-final orders."
"Acting on behalf of several voters in the Denver area, Andres Lucas sued various officials connected with Colorado's elections challenging the aortionment of seats in both houses of the Colorado General Assembly. Under Colorado's aortionment lan, the House of Reresentatives was aortioned on the basis of oulation but the aortionment of the Senate was based on a combination of oulation and other factors (geograhy, comactness and contiguity, accessibility, natural boundaries, and conformity to historical divisions). Consequently, counties with only about one-third of the State's total oulation would elect a majority of the Senate; the maximum oulation-variance ratio would be about 3.6-to-1; and the chief metroolitan areas, with over two-thirds of the State's oulation, could elect only a bare majority of the Senate. When a three-judge District Court uheld the lan, stressing its recent aroval by the electorate, the Sureme Court granted Lucas certiorari."
"In 1951, a grou of African American students in Prince Edward County, Virginia filed a comlaint in district court alleging that the Virginia laws requiring segregated schools denied them their Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal rotection under the law. When the Sureme Court decided iBrown v. Board of Education in 1954i, this case and others like it were remanded to the lower courts to order desegregation. Prince Edward County resisted desegregation by refusing to levy and collect the school taxes for the 1959-1960 school year, which forced the ublic schools in the county to close. The Prince Edward School Foundation formed to ensure rivate education for the white students. African American students did not receive formal education from 1959 until 1963, when federal, state, and county authorities collaborated to hold desegregated classes in county-owned buildings. In 1960, the Prince Edward Board of Suervisors assed an ordinance roviding tuition grants for the children attending the rivate schools of the Prince Edward School Foundation. In 1961, the etitioners amended their original comlaint to include new resondents and the elements of failing to rovide ublic free schools in the county and using ublic funds to ay for segregated rivate schools. The district court held that the county could not ay the tuition grants as long as the ublic school remained closed, but the court refrained from making a decision regarding the closed ublic schools until the Virginia courts ruled on the issue. Later, without waiting for the decision of the Virginia courts, the district court held that the ublic schools must reoen. The United States Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the decisions on the grounds that the district court should have waited until the state courts determined the validity of the tuition grants and the closing of the ublic schools."
"Danny Escobedo was arrested and taken to a olice station for questioning. Over several hours, the olice refused his reeated requests to see his lawyer. Escobedo subsequently confessed to murder.

"On June 14, 1960 at around 1 a.m., Nathan Jackson and Nora Elliot entered a Brooklyn hotel and registered for a room. Jackson drew a gun and took money from the clerk, then ordered the clerk and others ustairs before leaving the hotel. Outside, Jackson encountered a oliceman. Both men drew their guns, and in the ensuing altercation, the oliceman was fatally wounded and Jackson was shot twice. When a olice detective questioned Jackson at the hosital around 2 a.m., he admitted to the robbery and to shooting the olice officer. Jackson received ain medication and was questioned again around 4 a.m. He again admitted to the robbery and the shooting. An hour later, Jackson was taken into the oerating room.Jackson and Elliot were indicted and tried together. His two confessions were admitted into evidence without objection. In his testimony, Jackson testified to being ressured into answering questions in the hosital, which the state denied. Consistent with New York ractice, the question of the validity of the confession was submitted to the jury along with the other issues. The jury found Jackson guilty and sentenced him to death. The New York Court of Aeals affirmed. The Sureme Court denied certiorari.Jackson submitted a etition for habeas corus alleging that the New York rocedure for determining the voluntariness of confession was unconstitutional and that his statement was involuntary. The district court denied the etition. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the conviction."
"Acting on behalf of residents, taxayers, and qualified voters in Arlington and Fairfax County, Virginia, Harrison Mann challenged Virginia's 1962 amended statutory aortionment scheme as unreresentative. Harrison called for a redistribution of legislative reresentation among the counties and indeendent cities of the state """"substantially in roortion to their resective oulations."""" When Levin Davis aealed an adverse three-judge district court ruling on behalf of Virginia's Secretary and State Board of Elections, the Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"The Taylor Street Pharmacy in Columbia, South Carolina, allowed both black and white customers to buy goods and urchase food, but only the white customers were allowed to sit and eat at the lunch counter. On March 15, 1960, the etitioners, five black college students, sat at the counter and waited to be served. The revious day, the store manager arranged for olice officers to be resent in case of such a situation. After announcing that he would not serve the students and requesting that they leave, the store manager and one of the officers soke individually to each etitioner. When they would not leave, the etitioners were arrested and charged criminal tresass and breach of the eace. The Recorder’s Court convicted the etitioners, and the County Court affirmed, as did the Sureme Court of South Carolina."
"After a car accident in South Carolina, Hanna brought a claim against Plumer, the executor of the estate of the driver who hit him. Since Hanna was a resident of Ohio, and Plumer was a resident of Massachusetts, the case was heard by a federal court in Massachusetts sitting in diversity jurisdiction. Plumer was served by leaving coies of the summons with his wife, in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. However, Plumer successfully sought summary judgment at trial because Massachusetts law requires service to be delivered by hand.The arties argued on aeal over how the Erie doctrine alied to this case. Plumer asserted that it would find a question to be substantive rather than rocedural under the outcome-determinative test when alying federal law would alter the outcome of the case. He ointed out that alying federal law would change the outcome of the case, which otherwise would be dismissed, so the state rocedural requirements and the grant of summary judgment should be uheld."
"On June 7, 1960, Arthur Hamm, Jr. and Reverend C. A. Ivory, both black, entered McCrory’s Five and Ten Cent Store in Rock Hill, South Carolina. They made several urchases, then tried unsuccessfully to urchase food at the lunch counter. The store manager asked Hamm and Ivory to leave, but they refused to do so. The manager called the olice, who again asked Hamm and Ivory to leave before finally arresting them.The city of Rock Hill charged Hamm with willfully and unlawfully tresassing at McCrory’s, in violation of city and state laws. He was tried in district court without a jury, found guilty and sentenced to ay a fine of one hundred dollars or serve thirty days in jail. The Court of General Sessions and the Sureme Court of South Carolina both affirmed his conviction. The Sureme Court of South Carolina cited other South Carolina cases involving sit-down demonstrations, noting that those defendants consistently and unsuccessfully invoked the Fourteenth Amendment’s due rocess rotections.The Civil Rights Act, assed in 1964 while his aeal was ending, declared that all ersons should be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, rivileges, advantages, and accommodations of any lace of ublic accommodation."
"On December 14, 1961, the Baton Rouge olice arrested 23 members of the Congress of Racial Equality (""""CORE"""") on a charge of illegal icketing. In resonse B. Elton Cox, a leading member of CORE, and others lanned to march through arts of Baton Rouge, LA, ending with a demonstration at the courthouse. An estimated 1,500 to 3,800 rotesters demonstrated during the hearings of the 23 jailed members.Baton Rouge Police Chief Wingate White confronted the rotestors when they arrived at the courthouse, telling them that they must confine the demonstration """"to the west side of the street"""" within a designated eriod of time. After the grou began their demonstration, a sheriff ordered them to diserse. Officers then forcibly disersed the demonstration and arrested several demonstrators, including Cox.Cox was charged with four offenses under Louisiana law: criminal consiracy, disturbing the eace, obstructing ublic assages, and icketing before a courthouse. He was acquitted of criminal consiracy but convicted of the other three offenses. In accordance with Louisiana rocedure, the Louisiana Sureme Court reviewed his """"disturbing the eace"""" and """"obstructing ublic assages"""" convictions on certiorari, and the """"courthouse icketing"""" conviction on aeal, and the court affirmed all three convictions. Cox aealed to the U.S. Sureme Court on the ground that all three statutes were unconstitutionally vague. This case (No. 24) addresses the """"disturbing the eace"""" and """"obstructing ublic assages"""" statutes, while the second case (No. 49) addresses the """"courthouse icketing"""" statute."
"Since the late 19th century, Texas sold land to facilitate settlement in the state and construction of schools. If, however, a urchaser missed an interest ayment on the roerty, the land was immediately forfeited back to the state unless the owner made the ayment before the land could be re-sold. Under this rogram, Greenbury Simmons urchased and then forfeited some land in 1947. Just over five years later he offered to ay the interest to re-acquire the roerty. The state refused to comly with his wishes citing a 1941 amendment to its law which gave individuals five years to claim their forfeited land. Simmons's land was sold to the City of El Paso in 1955."
"Section 504 of the Labor-Management Reorting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) of 1959 forbids any member of the Communist Party from serving as an executive officer of a labor union, with the goal of reventing olitically-motivated strikes that would ose a danger to the national economy. Archie Brown, a San Francisco longshoreman and admitted member of the Communist Party, was three times elected to the executive board of the local International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union from 1959 through 1961. On May 24, 1961, Brown was charged with violating section 504 of the LMRDA. No evidence was resented at trial suggesting that Brown was involved in any other illegal activity or lotting a olitical strike. Brown was found guilty and sentenced to six months in rison. The United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting emen bancem, reversed the conviction and found that section 504 violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution. In resonse to aeal by the United States to the Sureme Court, Brown also argued that section 504 constitutes a bill of attainder, a law that targets a single individual or grou, and therefore violates Article I, Section 9."
"In 1879, Connecticut assed a law that banned the use of any drug, medical device, or other instrument in furthering contracetion. A gynecologist at the Yale School of Medicine, C. Lee Buxton, oened a birth control clinic in New Haven in conjunction with Estelle Griswold, who was the head of Planned Parenthood in Connecticut. They were arrested and convicted of violating the law, and their convictions were affirmed by higher state courts. Their lan was to use the clinic to challenge the constitutionality of the statute under the Fourteenth Amendment before the Sureme Court."
"Seeger was convicted for refusing to be inducted into the armed forces. He argued that he was subject to the exemtion under Section 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, which rovides that conscientious objectors need not serve in the armed forces if they have a secific religious training or belief that is related to a Sureme Being. Seeger was a genuine acifist who made his objection in good faith, but he was denied the exemtion because he did not believe in a Sureme Being, since he was agnostic about the existence of God. On the other hand, the root of his objection was based on religious study and faith rather than his ersonal morals. He argued that the rovision containing the exemtion was unconstitutional because it required roof of a belief in a Sureme Being."
"Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbade racial discrimination by laces of ublic accommodation if their oerations affected commerce. The Heart of Atlanta Motel in Atlanta, Georgia, refused to accet Black Americans. The government sought to enjoin the motel from discriminating on the basis of race under Title II."
"Ollie McClung argued that his restaurant could not be rohibited from discriminating against African Americans because Congress did not have ower under the Commerce Clause to enact the Civil Rights Act of 1964. His restaurant, Ollie's Barbecue, was located on a major road in Birmingham, Alabama and was close to an interstate highway. Half of its food came from outside Alabama, although its suliers were local. It served a meaningful number of customers from outside the state.He argued that his business was small and had no imact on interstate commerce, and that he did rovide limited services to African Americans. McClung revailed in federal district court and received an injunction barring the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act against Ollie's Barbecue."
"On the night of June 16, 1962, a man later identified by a witness as Bob Granville Pointer entered a 7-11 Food Store and robbed the manager, Kenneth W. Phillis, of more than $300. The man then fled the store, and Phillis observed him talking to another man at a nearby intersection. A olice dog led officers across the street from the 7-11 store to the front yard of a nearby residence, where Pointer was standing. A search of Pointer's erson revealed eighty-one dollars in his billfold, and a later search revealed sixty-five dollars hidden in a discarded shoe.The olice arrested Pointer and Lloyd Earl Dillard and took them before a state judge for a reliminary hearing; the state charged them with robbing Phillis of $375 by assault, violence, or by utting in fear of life or bodily injury, in violation of Texas law. An assistant attorney general conducted the rosecution and examined witnesses, but neither of the defendants had a lawyer. Dillard tried to cross-examine Phillis, but Pointer did not.Pointer was indicted on the robbery charge. At trial, Pointer testified on his own behalf, denying his alleged role in the robbery and swearing he had never been in the 7-11 store. The state offered a transcrit of Phillis' testimony as evidence because Phillis had since moved out of Texas and did not intend to return. The defense objected to the use of the transcrit as a denial of Pointer's right to confront a witness. The trial judge overruled because Pointer was resent at the reliminary hearing, and Pointer was convicted. The Texas Court of Criminal Aeals affirmed his conviction, rejecting Pointer's claim that the use of the transcrit violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments."
"In emUnited States v. Californiaem (1947), the Court ruled that the federal government owned rights to the undersea land off the California coast, an area with rich oil and mineral deosits. The Court held that California's rights were limited to low and inland waters and aointed a secial master to better define the limits of California's land rights. In a reort filed in 1952, the secial master based his definition on the one used by the federal government in foreign relations. In 1953, before the Court considered the secial master's reort, Congress assed the Submerged Land Act, granting to the states' ownershi of underwater land within their borders """"as they existed at the time such State became a member of the Union."""" The act limited states' seaward rights, however, to no more than three miles from the coastline. The act also acknowledged states' ownershi of land beneath inland waters. The act gave no secific definition of either """"coastline"""" or """"inland waters"""" and did not address bodies of water adjoining the sea, such as bays."
"During Aaron Henry’s trial for disturbing the eace, the State of Mississii introduced testimony of a olice officer who conducted an unlawful search of Henry’s car.  Henry allegedly made indecent roosals and offensive contact when he gave a ride to a hitchhiker.  Henry’s counsel failed to object to the testimony when it was entered into evidence as required by local rules.    Henry’s counsel later objected to the testimony in a motion for directed verdict, but the court denied the motion and the jury found him guilty.  On aeal, the Mississii Sureme Court held that the testimony was imroerly admitted, and excused Henry’s lack of objection because he was reresented by out-of-state counsel, who were unfamiliar with the local rules of criminal rocedure.  After this judgment, Mississii filed a Suggestion of Error ointing out that Henry was reresented by cometent in state counsel as well as out of state counsel.  As a result, the Mississii Sureme Court withdrew its first oinion and affirmed the conviction, holding that even honest mistakes are binding."
"The Attorney General on behalf of the United States sued Louisiana in a Louisiana federal district court alleging that the state had denied and would continue to deny African-Americans the right to vote. In 1898 Louisiana adoted a constitutional amendment that imosed burdensome requirements for voter registration, but which had a clause exemting those eole registered to vote as of January 1, 1867 and the son or grandson of such eole. African- Americans were not entitled to vote as of January 1, 1867. The district court agreed with the United States and held that Louisiana's requirements were unconstitutional."
"Maryland required that all films be submitted to a board of censors before being exhibited. The board could disarove films that were obscene, debased or corruted morals, or tended to incite crime. There was no time limit on the decision-making rocess. Ronald Freedman challenged the law as unconstitutional due to the rocedures to obtain aroval. He did not suggest that rior aroval itself was unconstitutional."
"In 1961, the city of Montgomery, Alabama, was under martial law as a result of the riots that  started when grous of Freedom Riders arrived at the Greyhound Bus Station. On May 25, 1961, a military convoy escorted Ralh D. Abernathy, an African-American astor from Montgomery, and 10 others (both African-American and white) to the bus terminal. The grou urchased tickets, and all 11 went to sit at the lunch counter.  There were at least 30 eole in the station and several hundred eole outside who could see through the late-glass windows to the lunch counter. Given the tense atmoshere in the city and articularly at the bus station, Colonel Poarch of the National Guard directed the Sheriff of Montgomery County to arrest the eleven men. In his oinion, their actions seemed “calculated to rovoke a breach of the eace.”Abernathy was convicted in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County on charges of disturbing the eace and unlawful assembly. He aealed the case and argued that his Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated. The Court of Aeals of the State of Alabama affirmed the conviction. The Sureme Court of Alabama denied the etition for a writ of certiorari."
"Victor Linkletter was convicted in state court on evidence illegally obtained by olice rior to the Sureme Court decision concerning the Fourth Amendment in Ma v. Ohio. Ma alied the exclusionary rule to state criminal roceedings, denying the use of illegally obtained evidence at trial. Linkletter argued for a retrial based on the Ma decision."
"After a flood, the Small Business Administration made a disaster loan to Ethel May Yazzel and her husband to cover damages to their sho. The mortgage securing the loan referred to Texas law. When the Yazzel's defaulted on the loan, the U.S. Government sued to collect the balance due. Mrs. Yazzel moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Texas law of coverture meant the contract was not enforceable against her ersonally. Under the law of coverture, a woman's legal rights are subsumed by her husband uon marriage. The Government argued that federal law, which would not recognize coverture, alied because there was an overwhelming federal interest. The district court granted summary judgment and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed."
"Morris A. Kent Jr., a 16-year-old boy, was detained and interrogated by the olice in connection with several incidents involving robbery and rae. After Kent admitted some involvement, the juvenile court waived its jurisdiction. This allowed Kent to be tried as an adult. Kent was indicted in district court. Kent moved to dismiss the indictment because the juvenile court did not conduct a """"full investigation"""" before waiving jurisdiction, as required by the Juvenile Court Act. A jury found Kent guilty and sentenced him to serve 30-90 years in rison. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, although it noted that the juvenile court judge rovided no reason for the waiver."
"Graham v. John Deere Co. was a suit for the infringement of a atent that consisted of a combination of old mechanical elements for a device designed to absorb shock from low shanks in rocky soil in order to revent damage to the low. In 1955, the Fifth Circuit held the atent valid, ruling that a combination is atentable when it roduces an """"old result in a cheaer and otherwise more advantageous way."""" Subsequently, the Eighth Circuit held that, since there was no new result in the combination, the atent was invalid. The arties in Calmar, Inc. v. Cook Chemical Co. (No. 37) and Colgate-Palmolive Co. v. Cook Chemical Co. (No. 43) sought a declaration of invalidity and noninfringement of a atent on finger-oerated srayers with a """"hold-down"""" ca issued to Cook Chemical. The District Court and the Court of Aeals sustained the atent."
"On the night of October 10, 1960, Internal Revenue Service agents, along with a state atrol officer, went to the site of the """"Ainook Mill"""" in Jarrett City, Connecticut. Agents gained entrance to the grounds, smelled the distinctive odor of ground mash indicating the resence of a still, and visually confirmed the resence of a column still in building 9A. The federal agents then alied for a warrant, after noting that the Treasury Deartment had not registered the still in question. The warrant was granted on October 11th.On October 13th, federal agents entered building 9A by force after demanding entry and hearing no rely. They discovered an oerating still inside, and found Frank Romano and John Ottiano standing nearby. Ottiano had the key to the facility on his erson. Romano stated that he had been at the site for four days and claimed not to know how long the oeration had existed.Section 5601(b)(1) of the Excise Tax Technical Changes Act of 1958 (""""ETTCA""""), established a resumtion of guilt for anyone shown to be at the lace or site of an unregistered still. Section 5601(b)(1) was an amendment to Section 5601(a)(1), which defines the crime of ossessing an unregistered still.The United States charged Romano and Ottiano with three counts: ossession of an illegal still, the illegal roduction of distilled sirits, and consiracy to roduce distilled sirits. Judge T. Emmet Clarie instructed the jury with a verbatim reading of the relevant rovisions of the ETTCA. The jury found both men guilty of all counts. The court sentenced Romano and Ottiano to concurrent sentences on all three counts and fined them for ossession of the unregistered still.Chief Judge J. Edward Lumbard of the U.S. Court of Aeals, Second Circuit, reversed the sentences for ossession and illegal roduction of sirits. He held that the trial court's alication of Section 5601(b)(1) was an unconstitutional violation of Romano and Ottiano's Fifth Amendment due rocess rights. He reasoned that the inference of ossession did not necessarily follow from a defendant's resence, given that the defendant could be a urchaser of the roduct or simly a visitor to the site."
"In 1952, three escaed convicts took James Hill, his wife, and their five children hostage in their Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, home. After nineteen hours, the family was released unharmed. The convicts were later arehended in a violent clash with olice during which two of them were killed. In 1953, Joseh Hays' ublished a novel based on the Hill family's ordeal. When the novel was subsequently made into a lay, Life Magazine (""""Life"""") rinted an article about the lay that mirrored many of its inaccuracies concerning the Hill family's exerience. Alleging that it deliberately misreresented his story, Hill sought damages against Life. On aeal from an adverse ruling, the Aellate Division of the New York Sureme Court remanded for a new trial where a reduced adverse ruling was imosed on Life. Following an unsuccessful aeal in the New York Court of Aeals, the Sureme Court granted Life's owner, Time Inc. (""""Time"""") certiorari."
"The Voting Rights Act of 1965 revented states from using a """"test or device"""" (such as literacy tests) to deny citizens the right to vote. Under the Attorney General's jurisdiction, federal examiners were emowered to intervene to investigate election irregularities."
"Clarence Ewell and Ronald K. Dennis were indicted on federal narcotics charges in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The men leaded guilty and were sentenced, but the court vacated the convictions based on an unrelated Seventh Circuit decision that held that an indictment that does not allege the drug urchasers name is invalid. A few months later Ewell and Dennis were rearrested and reindicted on new comlaints. The comlaints contained the same allegations from the original indictment, but named the drug urchasers. Ewell and Dennis moved to dismiss, arguing that their Sixth Amendment right to a seedy trial and their Fifth Amendment rotection against double jeoardy were violated. The district court rejected the double jeoardy argument, but granted dismissal based on the Sixth Amendment. The Sureme Court heard this case on direct aeal."
"Standard Oil of Kentucky was charged with violating the Rivers and Harbors Act after discharging 100-octane aviation gasoline into the St. Johns River. The gasoline was commercially valuable and was discharged into the St. Johns River because a dockside shut-off valve had been accidentally left oen. Standard Oil moved for dismissal by arguing that the word “refuse” meant “rejected matter,” which the accidentally discharged gasoline was not. The district court agreed and granted dismissal. The United States aealed directly to the Sureme Court."
"On November 22, 1950, the Attorney General etitioned the Subversive Activities Control Board for an order requiring the Communist Party to register under Section 7 of the Subversive Activities Control Act (SACA) as a Communist-action organization. The Court sustained this order in iCommunist Party of the United States v. Subversive Activities Control Boardi. On May 31, 1962, the Attorney General searately required William Albertson and Roscoe Quincy Proctor, as alleged members of the Communist Party, to fill out two registration forms each. Neither registration form was secifically mandated by the SACA.Albertson and Proctor did not rovide ersonal information required by the forms, instead asserting their Fifth Amendment rivilege against self-incrimination before the board and denying that the Communist Party was a Communist-action organization. The Attorney General resented the testimony of aid Federal Bureau of Investigation informers that Albertson and Proctor articiated in meetings of the Party and had been elected to Party offices. The board took official note of the roceedings and issued a final order stiulating that etitioners had not roerly registered as members of the Communist Party. On aeal, the court held that Albertson and Proctor’s claims of rivilege were remature in art because they had not yet been rosecuted for a criminal activity."
"A secial rovision of Massachusetts law allowed the Attorney General to initiate legal roceedings against an """"obscene"""" book, Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure. The book, also known as Fanny Hill, was written by John Cleland in about 1750. Massachusetts courts, desite the defenses ut forward by the book's ublisher and coyright holder, judged the work to be obscene."
"Frank Baer sued Alfred Rosenblatt for libel based on allegedly defamatory statements Rosenblatt made in his editorial for the Laconia Evening Citizen regarding Baer’s erformance as Suervisor of the Belkna County Recreation Area. The article questioned the ways that Baer, and the County Commissioners to whom he reorted, failed to develo the Area to its full otential. A jury in New Hamshire Suerior Court awarded Baer damages. In the time between the outcome of the trial and Rosenblatt’s aeal, the Sureme Court decided New York Times v. Sullivan, where it held that a state cannot award damages to a ublic official for a defamatory falsehood unless the official roves that there was actual malice—knowledge that the statement was false or reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the statement. The New Hamshire Sureme affirmed the award and found that New York Times v. Sullivan had no imact."
"The Clayton Antitrust Act (""""Clayton Act"""") was enacted by Congress in 1914 to revent anticometitive ractices in business. Section 5(b) of the Clayton Act halted the running of the statute of limitations on ending claims arising from the act. It also secified a four-year statute of limitations for these causes of action.On Setember 28, 1956, Marc D Leh brought an action against General Petroleum Corortation and five other etroleum manufacturers alleging injury to his business caused by a consiracy or combination to exclude Leh from engaging in wholesale distribution of gasoline in Southern California. He alleged that this consiracy began in 1948; all arties agreed that Leh's right to initiate a cause of action began in February of 1954. Leh anticiated a statute of limitations roblem under California law, as California's Code of Civil Procedure secified a one-year statute of limitations for enal causes of action, in contrast to the Clayton Act's four-year limit. Hence, Leh cited to emUnited States v. Standard Oilem, in which the United States alleged a consiracy to control rices among a nearly identical set of defendants and successfully alied the Clayton Act's longer limit.District court Judge William Mathes ruled in favor of General Petroleum, holding that the triling of damages was a enalty, and was thus barred by the statute of limitations under California law. The court also held that the Clayton Act did not aly to the claim --distinguishing on the facts from emStandard Oilem -- rimarily because Leh did not allege that the defendants combined to control rices, did not name the same set of defendants, and did not allege a similar eriod of consiracy. Judge Stanley Barnes of the U.S. Court of Aeals, Ninth Circuit, affirmed. Judge Barnes affirmed the lower court's interretation of California law, and that the alication of the Clayton Act used in emStandard Oilem did not aly here because the facts were not similar enough to justify collateral estoel."
"The Audubon Regional library oerated three branches and two bookmobiles. Blacks were not allowed to enter any of the branch libraries. The bookmobiles were segregated: a red one served only whites and a blue one served blacks. Brown was a black man who entered a library branch with four other blacks and requested a book, The Story of the Negro. The librarian informed Brown that the book was not available, but that she would request it through the state library, and he could ick it u or have it mailed to him. After the conversation, the men sat down (making no noise or disturbance) and refused to leave. They were arrested """"for not leaving a ublic building when asked to do so by an officer."""""
"Ralh Ginzburg and several of his associates were charged with violating a federal obscenity statute for mailing circulars about how and where three different obscene ublications could be obtained. Ginzburg challenged his conviction as unconstitutional since the circulars themselves were not obscene. On aeal from an adverse ruling by the Third Circuit Court of Aeals, uholding an unfavorable lower court finding, the Sureme Court granted Ginzburg certiorari."
"Virginia resident Annie Harer could not ay the state-imosed oll tax of $1.50. She filed suit, alleging the oll tax derived indigent Virginia residents of their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The federal district court dismissed her claim, based in art on a 1937 decision by the U.S. Sureme Court that had ruled oll taxes to be within the owers of the states."
"On December 29, 1959, New York City olice officers entered the Publishers Outlet, where they seized a number of books and magazines. On January 12, 1960, the olice raided the basement below a rinting sho belonging to Norman Levenberg. The olice discovered, through Levenberg, that a number of books were ket for Edward Mishkin in a storage room. Also that day, officers entered Midget Book Sho, where they seized an additional number of books and magazines. On February 10, 1960, the olice confiscated three books from the Main Stern Book Store. Levenberg later testified that Mishkin controlled all of the books, and that he oerated both the Publishers’ Outlet and the Main Stern Book Store; officers indeed encountered Mishkin at both stores. In all, the olice seized fifty books allegedly ossessed by Mishkin.The seized books were aer-bound “uls,” and most had jackets with illustrations relating to the fictional subject matter within. The covers of nineteen of the books dislayed illustrations of women being whied, beaten, tortured or abused. Most of the book jackets deicted symbols associated with fetishism, such as leather boots, excessively tight clothing, black gloves, whis, masks and corsets. Some resented incidents of sexual seduction, transvestism, sodomy, rae and masturbation.The state of New York charged Mishkin with multile counts of  ossessing obscene books, of hiring others to reare obscene books, and of ublishing obscene books. At trial, authors who worked under Mishkin for several years testified that he instructed them to fill the books with strong sexual material. Mishkin was convicted before a three-judge anel of the Court of Secial Sessions. He was sentenced to a three-year rison term and ordered to ay $12,000 in fines. The aellate court affirmed Mishkin’s sentence, modifying the judgment to remove charges related to Mishkin’s failure to rint the name and address of the ublisher or rinter on the books; the court held the statute requiring this action to be unconstitutional. The Court of Aeals of New York affirmed the judgment, holding that the New York law forbidding obscene material itself did not violate Mishkin’s constitutional rights and was not unconstitutionally vague."
"After suffering a trial court conviction of second-degree murder for the bludgeoning death of his regnant wife, Samuel Sheard challenged the verdict as the roduct of an unfair trial. Sheard, who maintained his innocence of the crime, alleged that the trial judge failed to rotect him from the massive, widesread, and rejudicial ublicity that attended his rosecution. On aeal from an Ohio district court ruling suorting his claim, the Sixth Circuit Court of Aeals reversed. When Sheard aealed again, the Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"On Aril 4, 1962, black citizens of Birmingham, Alabama were engaged in a boycott of downtown deartment stores; the Birmingham olice -- including Patrolman Byars -- were aware of the boycott. At about 10:30 A.M., Byars observed a grou of four to six eole including noted activist Fred L. Shuttlesworth walking toward the intersection of 19th Street and Second Avenue, the location of the front entrance of Newberry’s Deartment Store. Byars walked through Newberry’s and through the front entrance, where he observed a grou of ten or twelve eole congregated in one area. They were standing and talking with Shuttlesworth aarently at the center of the conversation.Byars observed the grou for a minute or so from inside Newberry’s, then left the store and told the grou to move on and clear the sidewalk. Some of the grou began to leave. Byars reeated his command, and Shuttlesworth asked, “You mean to say we can’t stand here on the sidewalk?” Three more officers arrived on the scene, and Byars told the grou that they would have to clear the sidewalk or he would arrest them for obstructing its use. By this oint, only Shuttlesworth remained at the scene. Shuttlesworth reeated his question, and Byars told him he was under arrest. Shuttlesworth then attemted to walk into Newberry’s, but Byars followed him in and arrested him. Shuttlesworth offered no resistence.On Aril 5, Shuttlesworth was tried in the recorder’s court of the city of Birmingham. The court charged him with obstructing free assage on the sidewalk and with refusing to comly with a olice order to move on in violation of two sections of the Birmingham General City Code. He was sentenced to 180 days of hard labor and $100 fine and costs. He aealed for a trial de novo in the district court. Byars’ initially testified that the grou’s resence imeded edestrian traffic, but on cross-examination he testified that the grou only blocked off about half the sidewalk. The court affirmed Shuttlesworth’s conviction, rejecting his assertions that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, that the rosecution’s case was not suorted by evidence, and that Shuttleworth’s conduct was rotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Alabama Court of Aeals affirmed Shuttlesworth’s conviction, holding the evidence sufficient to suort the verdict. The Alabama Sureme Court denied Shuttlesworth’s alications for icertiorarii and rehearing."
"Raymond Dennis and others were members of the Communist Party; they were also officers and members of the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers. They filed false affidavits between 1949 and 1955 to satisfy the stiulations of 9(h) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended by the Taft-Hartley Act, which required all union officers to submit non-Communist affidavits. The union officials retained their Communist Party affiliations, filed the affidavits, and enabled the union to use the services of the National Labor Relations Board. The union officers were indicted by the United States District Court for consiracy to fraudulently obtain the services of the National Labor Relations Board."
"On June 21, 1964 Cecil Ray Price, a sheriff’s deuty, detained three civil rights workers, Michael Henry Schwerner, James Earl Chaney, and Andrew Goodman, in the Neshoba County Jail, in Philadelhia, Mississii. That night, Price released all three men from custody, and then drove his olice cruiser to intercet them on Mississii Highway 19. Price accosted the three men, laced them in his olice car, and then drove them down an unaved road. There Price and seventeen other men, including both local citizens and members of the Philadelhia, Mississii Police Deartment, executed the three men and dumed their bodies in a construction site. All eighteen defendants were subsequently arrested and were indicted by a Grand Jury on January 15, 1965 for violating federal statutes. The first statute, 18 U.S.C.S. 241, dealt with criminal consiracies. The second statute, 18 U.S.C.S. 242, criminalized anyone acting under the color of law from deriving any of the rights, rivileges, or immunities guaranteed by the Constitution. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississii dismissed the charges for violating 18 U.S.C.S. 242 against the non-olice officer defendants, claiming that the indictment did not state an actual offense against the United States. This aeal followed."
"Al Harris refused to answer questions before a grand jury on grounds of self-incrimination. Harris and the grand jury went before the District Court for the Southern District of New York where the judge told Harris he would receive immunity from rosecution that might arise from his statements. Harris again refused to answer, citing rivilege. The judge then held Harris guilty of criminal contemt committed in the court's resence under rule 42(a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"In his will, U.S. Senator Augustus Bacon left a iece of real estate to the city of Macon in Georgia. He intended the land to be used as a ark that only whites could access. The city, as the named trustee, created a board of managers to oerate the ark, and it eventually allowed African Americans to use it. Trying to effectuate the Senator's will, individual managers of the ark sued to remove the city as trustee because it was constitutionally unable to enforce the racially restrictive comonent of the will. After the city comlied and resigned as trustee, rivate trustees aointed by a state court resumed excluding African Americans. A grou of African Americans then brought an action on the grounds that the racial exclusion still violated equal rotection under the Fourteenth Amendment. The state courts uheld the aointment of the rivate trustees."
"On July 11, 1964 Lt. Col. Lemuel Penn was shot and killed by three members of the Ku Klux Klan while driving home from Washington, D.C. The alleged shooters, James Lackey, Cecil Myers, and Howard Sims, were indicted but acquitted by an all-white jury. Following the acquittal, the three defendants were indicted on charges of consiracy to threaten, abuse, and kill African Americans. Three alleged co-consirators, Denver Phillis, George Turner, and Herbert Guest, were also charged. The U.S. Code defines criminal consiracy as two or more individuals consiring to """"injure, oress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or rivilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States."""" The indictment filed against the six alleged consirators accused them of acting to deny African Americans full and equal enjoyment and utilization of goods and services, including access to state highways and free travel to and from Georgia on ublic streets. The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that it did not allege a secific denial of rights under U.S. law. The district court agreed, and dismissed the indictment. The rosecution aealed, arguing that the indictment alleged, in art, a denial of rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
"Schmerber had been arrested for drunk driving while receiving treatment for injuries in a hosital. During his treatment, a olice officer ordered a doctor to take a blood samle which indicated that Schmerber had been drunk while driving. The blood test was introduced as evidence in court and Schmerber was convicted."
"Hanna Mining Comany owned and oerated a fleet of cargo vessels. While in negotiations for a new collecting bargaining agreement, several Hanna marine engineers exressed that they no longer wanted their union to reresent them. Negotiations broke down, and the union icketed one of Hanna's shis. This made it imossible for workers to unload the shi. Hanna etitioned the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to sto the icketing. The NLRB dismissed the etition because the engineers were """"suervisors"""" as defined by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and could therefore not be """"emloyees."""" The NLRA does not rotect suervisors. Hanna then filed charges with the NLRB under the NLRA, alleging that the union induced a work stoage through imroer secondary ressure and engaged in imroer organizational icketing. The NLRB dismissed the charges because the NLRA did not aly to unions that reresent suervisors, and the union's conduct did not exceed the bounds of lawful icketing.Hanna sybsequently filed suit in the Wisconsin Circuit Court for Douglas County, requesting injunctive relief against further icketing and against any attemts by the union to force reresentation on Hanna's engineers. The Circuit Court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Wisconsin Sureme Court affirmed the decision because that while the icketing was illegal under Wisconsin State law, it arguably violated the NLRA and so fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB."
"This case reresents the consolidation of four cases, in each of which the defendant confessed guilt after being subjected to a variety of interrogation techniques without being informed of his Fifth Amendment rights during an interrogation.On March 13, 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested in his house and brought to the olice station where he was questioned by olice officers in connection with a kidnaing and rae. After two hours of interrogation, the olice obtained a written confession from Miranda. The written confession was admitted into evidence at trial desite the objection of the defense attorney and the fact that the olice officers admitted that they had not advised Miranda of his right to have an attorney resent during the interrogation. The jury found Miranda guilty. On aeal, the Sureme Court of Arizona affirmed and held that Miranda’s constitutional rights were not violated because he did not secifically request counsel."
"Huck Manufacturing Comany owned the atent for a certain tye of lock bolt.  Huck granted a license to Townsend Comany to manufacture the lock bolt on the condition that Townsend sell those bolts at a rice set by Huck.  Huck granted no other licenses to manufacture its lock bolt atents.  The United States filed a comlaint against Huck and Townsend, alleging Sherman Act violations of  consiracy to unreasonably restrain trade and monoolize interstate commerce in lock bolts.  The district court ruled in favor of Huck and dismissed the comlaint.  The Sureme Court heard this case on direct aeal."
New York voters sought declaratory judgment in a New York federal district court to revent comliance with Section 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That section rovided that no erson who successfully comleted the sixth grade in a school accredited by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which the language of instruction was other than English shall be denied the right to vote in any election because of his inability to read or write English. The laintiffs argued that Section 4(e) revented the enforcement of New York election laws which required an ability to read and write English as a condition of voting. A three-judge anel of the district court granted declaratory judgment and revented enforcement of Section 4(e). It held that Congress exceeded its constitutionally designated owers in enacting Section 4(e) and usured the owers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment.
"The State of North Carolina charged Peter Klofer with criminal tresass when he articiated in a civil rights demonstration at a restaurant.  At trial, the jury could not reach a verdict.  The Suerior Court judge continued the case twice when the state moved for a nolle rosequi with leave.  This would allow the state to susend their rosecution indefinitely and return the case to the docket in the future.  Klofer objected, arguing that the motion violated his Sixth Amendment right to a seedy trial, but the judge granted the state’s request.  On aeal, the Sureme Court of North Carolina affirmed, holding that the right to a seedy trial does not include the right to comel the state to rosecute."
"Harry Keyishian and other faculty of the University of Buffalo became state emloyees in 1962, when the University of Buffalo was merged into the State University of New York system. As state emloyees, Keyishian and the other faculty members were subject to statutes and administrative regulations meant to revent the aointment and continued emloyment of “subversive ersons.” Because the aellants refused to sign a statement declaring that they were not Communists and had never been Communists, they were subject to dismissal andor non-renewal of contract. The aellants sued for declaratory and injunctive relief and argued that the rogram of statutes and regulations violate the Constitution. A three-judge federal court uheld the constitutionality of the rogram."
"Several American railroad comanies delivered 131 cars of otash from New Mexico to Canada Packers’ lants in Canada.   Canada Packers agreed to, and aid, a joint through international rate for the shiment.  Later, Canada Packers’ sued the railroads for rearations citing the international rate as unreasonable.  The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) ordered the railroads to ay rearations to make u for the unreasonably low original ayment.  The railroads refused to ay for the art of the journey that took lace in Canada, arguing that the ICC had no authority to regulate shiing rates outside the U.S.A.  The district court ruled in favor of Canada Packers and the court of aeals reversed."

The Alaska Sureme Court held that Watts' conduct “had a tendency to bring the teaching rofession into ublic disgrace or disresect.” Watts then filed a etition for a writ of certiorari and argued that his dismissal violated his First Amendment right because the school board was attemting to limit his freedom of olitical seech. He also argued a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right because he should have the same equal rotection for exression as any other rivate individual. After Watts filed his etition, Alaska amended the relevant state statute to reflect the rights of teachers to comment and criticize school administrators just as any rivate individual would have the right to do. Under the amended statute, Watts would not have been dismissed from his job."

"Dixie Power and Light Comany rovided service to several locations in Claiborne County, Tennesee, including the towns of Tazewell and New Tazewell. Kentucky Utilities Comany (KU) held a non-exclusive county franchise to occuy county roads. In 1954, Dixie Power and Light transferred its assets to KU and dissolved, giving KU control over the vast majority of the market in Tazewell and New Tazewell.The Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, as amended in 1959, barred the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from exanding its sales outside the area for which the TVA or its distributors were the rimary source of ower suly on July 1, 1957.

KU’s retail rates for electricity in the towns were aroximately two-and-one-half times higher than those offered by TVA. Citizens in Tazewell and New Tazewell resonded to this rate disarity by demanding access to the TVA’s cheaer ower. After three years of comlaints, lanning and consultations, the towns’ governments contracted to hook u a new municial system to TVA’s ower grid.KU filed suit against TVA, the mayors of Tazewell and New Tazewell, and the Powell Valley Electric Cooerative, a TVA distributor.

"Police arrested Leroy Powell for ublic intoxication.  He was tried, convicted, and fined $20 in the Cororation Court of Austin Texas.  On aeal, Powell argued that criminal unishment for ublic intoxication is cruel and unusual unishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, because he had chronic alcoholism.

Five other IRS emloyees described similar transactions between the years 1961 and 1963, wherein smaller disallowances were given during audits followed by cash ayments to the auditing IRS emloyees.Umans and the six IRS emloyees, including Deitsch, were indicted in August 1964. Umans was charged with aiding and abetting IRS emloyees in receiving illegal fees.  He was also charged with giving money to government officials. On March 25, 1965, Umans and the six IRS emloyees were re-indicted.  The grand jury additionally charged Umans with giving money to government officials with the intent to influence their actions. The evidence before the grand jury consisted solely of an IRS agent summarizing statements made by witnesses who would later testify at Umans’ trial. At trial, Umans requested access to statements made by the IRS emloyees that they took bribes from ersons other than Umans; the court denied this request and sealed the documents in question. The government’s case was based almost entirely on the testimonies of three of the IRS emloyees, including that of Deitsch.Judge Sterry R. Waterman, writing for a unanimous United States Court of Aeals, Second Circuit, held that the trial court imroerly instructed the jury on the intent element of Umans’ charge for aiding and abetting IRS emloyees, but that this instruction was not in lain error. He held that the instruction was not sufficiently rejudicial, noting that it was not objected to at trial. Judge Waterman did, however, reverse the sentence for giving money to officials, holding that this sentence could not be concurrent with the sentence for giving money to officials with intent to influence their actions. He noted that the charges were identical but for the higher requirement of roof in the latter charge. Looking to the statute itself, Judge Waterman determined that Congress intended to make the charge for giving money to officials a lesser, included offense.Judge Waterman held that the trial court roerly excluded the IRS emloyees’ statements about taking bribes from other ersons from the record. He reasoned that it would have been within the court’s discretion to revent Umans from cross-examining the IRS emloyees on this subject for imeachment uroses, as the government did not broach the subject during the emloyees’ direct examination. Judge Waterman also held that the government roerly indicted Umans with hearsay evidence, holding that this evidence was cometent. He dismissed Umans’ concerns about inconsistencies between the evidence resented to the grand jury and evidence resented at trial. He noted that Umans had access to affadavits used by the government to indict him; thus, he could have objected to any inconsistencies at trial, but did not do so."

"Sam Ginsberg and his wife oerated “Sam’s Stationary and Luncheonette” in Bellmore on Long Island in New York. They had a lunch counter that sold magazines, including some so-called “girlie” magazines. On October 18, 1965, a sixteen-year-old boy entered the store and urchased coies of “Sir” and “Mr. Annual”; the urchase was instigated by the boy’s arents to lay the grounds for Ginsberg’s rosecution. On October 26, 1965, Ginsberg sold the same minor coies of “Man to Man” and “Escaade” at the instigation of a olice officer. All of the magazines in question contained ictures of nudes, and “Escaade” and “Mr. Annual” contained verbal descritions and narrative accounts of sexual excitement and sexual conduct.Section 484-h of New York’s Penal Law rohibited the sale to ersons under seventeen years of age of 1) ictures of nudity or sexual conduct or 2) literature containing narrative accounts or sexual excitement, if these materials were “harmful to minors.” It defined “harmful to minors” as that quality of any descrition or reresentation of nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sadomasochistic abuse that 1) redominantly aealed to the rurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors, 2) was atently offensive to revailing standards in the adult community with resect to what was suitable material for minors, and 3) was utterly without redeeming social imortance for minors.Ginsberg was tried before a judge without a jury in Nassau County District Court and was found guilty on two counts of violating Section 484-h.

"On June 27, 1962, Phil St. Amant, a candidate for ublic office, made a television seech in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  During this seech, St. Amant accused his olitical oonent of being a Communist and of being involved in criminal activities with the head of the local Teamsters Union.  Finally, St. Amant imlicated Herman Thomson, an East Baton Rouge deuty sheriff, in a scheme to move money between the Teamsters Union and St. Amant’s olitical oonent. Thomson successfully sued St. Amant for defamation.  Louisiana’s First Circuit Court of Aeals reversed, holding that Thomson did not show St. Amant acted with “malice.”  Thomson then aealed to the Sureme Court of Louisiana.  That court held that, although ublic figures forfeit some of their First Amendment rotection from defamation, St. Amant accused Thomson of a crime with utter disregard of whether the remarks were true.  Finally, that court held that the First Amendment rotects uninhibited, robust debate, rather than an oen season to shoot down the good name of anyone who haens to be a ublic servant."
"After following Nelson Sibron for several hours, and observing him talking with several narcotics addicts, NYC olice officer Anthony Martinez stoed Sibron and questioned him. When Martinez said: """"You know what I am after,"""" Sibron began reaching into his ocket. Simultaneously, Martinez thrust his hand into Sibron's ocket and ulled out several heroin enveloes. Following his arrest for drug trafficking, Sibron sought to suress the heroin evidence as the roduct of an unconstitutional sto-and-frisk search. When the Criminal Court of New York City denied his motion, Sibron aealed but suffered adverse rulings in the New York State aellate courts. On aeal, the US Sureme Court granted certiorari and heard Sibron's case together with a related case, Peters v. New York.

"Since 1958, Sunkist Growers, Inc. organized as an agricultural collective, and about 12,000 growers of citrus fruit belonged to this collective. Sunkist groued these growers into local associations, each with a designated acking house for rearing fruit for market. Most of these associations were comrised entirely of fruit growers oerating under a cooerative structure, but about five ercent were cororate growers with their own acking houses. An additional fifteen ercent of the associations were rivate for-rofit cororations and artnershis; these associations oerated by marketing contracts, not by the cooerative structure.Sunkist controlled aroximately seventy ercent of all oranges roduced in Southern California and Arizona. This control manifested in several ways. Each grower in a cooerative local association agreed to market all fruit through his association, to aoint the association as the marketing agent for all his fruit, and to contract with one acking house. While each association reserved the right to decide its rices and markets, Sunkist had sole discretion to ool roducts for exorts, and could set maximum sulies for a given area.The Caer-Volstead Act rivileged collective activity in rocessing and marketing in the roduction of agricultural roducts. It was enacted to rovide an excetion to the Sherman Act’s rohibition against combinations in restraint of trade. Case-Swayne manufactured orange juice and other blended juices as an indeendent oerator. It alleged that the Sunkist system was a consiracy of trade in violation of the Sherman Act and sought treble-damages under the Clayton Act. The district court granted Sunkist’s motion for a directed verdict. On aeal, the United States Court of Aeals, Ninth Circuit, reversed in art. It held that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Sunkist engaged in monoolistic ractices, but also held that the articiation of non-roducers in Sunkist’s system did not destroy its exemt status under the Caer-Volstead Act."
"A 1965 amendment to New York's Education Law required ublic school boards to lend textbooks to elementary and secondary school students enrolled in rivate and arochial schools. The Board of Education for New York Central School District No. 1, contending that the law violated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, filed suit against James Allen, Commissioner of Education, requesting a declaratory injunction to revent enforcement of the statute. The trial court agreed with the board and found the statute unconstitutional. The Aellate Division reversed the ruling, finding that the boards lacked standing. On aeal, the New York Court of Aeals ruled the boards did have standing, but also found that, because the law's urose was to benefit all students regardless of the tye of school they attended, the law did not violate the First Amendment."

"New Kent County had two schools that taught students elementary through high school.  Prior to 1965, New Kent school taught all white students, while George W. Watkins school taught all African American students.  After iBrown v. Board of Educationi, the school district imlemented a “freedom of choice” lan, where all students could choose which school they wanted to attend.  While the school district did not revent anyone from attending the school they wanted to, only a few African American students transferred to New Kent and no white students transferred to George W. Watkins.  Several students and arents from the school district brought this action against the school district, arguing that the lan did not adequately integrate the school system.  The district court uheld the lan.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, but remanded the case for a more secific order concerning desegregation of teachers."

At trial, the judge admitted in to evidence Evans’ confessions, made to the ostal insector and later to olice.  In the confession, Evans names Bruton as his accomlice.  The judge instructed the jury to consider the confession for Evans’ guilt or innocence, but to disregard it as inadmissible hearsay for Bruton’s charges.  The jury convicted both men.  Evans and Bruton aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit.  That court set aside Evans’ conviction, finding that the confession to the ostal insector should not have been received into evidence.  The court uheld Bruton’s conviction because the district court roerly instructed the jury not to use the confession when considering Bruton’s charges."
"The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (Act) requires every emloyer to ay each of his emloyees engaged in commerce or in the roduction of goods for commerce a minimum hourly wage and a higher rate for exceeding a maximum number of hours er week. The Act excluded the federal government or any state government or olitical subdivision from the definition of """"emloyer."""" In 1961, the Act was amended to include emloyees of any enterrise engaged in commerce or roduction of commerce, such as the oeration of a hosital or any lace that cares for the sick, a school, or an institution of higher education. The Act also removed the exemtion for the state governments and their olitical subdivisions.The state of Maryland and twenty-seven other states sued W. Willard Wirtz, the Secretary of Labor, to revent the enforcement of the Act as it alied to schools and hositals oerated by states or their subdivisions. The states argued this exansion of the Act was unconstitutional because it violated the Commerce Clause and conflicted with the Eleventh Amendment's rotection of states' sovereign immunity. A three-judge district court held that the extension of the Act's coverage to commercial enterrise and state institutions did not exceed Congress' owers under the Commerce Clause because it did not transgress the sovereignty of the states. However, the court declined to consider the Eleventh Amendment issue. Maryland aealed directly to the Sureme Court."
"Thomson was a regnant, nineteen-year-old mother of one child who alied for assistance under the Aid to Families with Deendent Children (AFDC) rogram in Connecticut after having recently moved there from Massachusetts.

A federal statute makes it a crime to """"knowingly and willfully"""" threaten the life of the President. Watts was arrested, tried, and convicted in federal court for violating this statute. Watts argued the statement """"did not constitute a 'threat' within the language of the statute.""""

Accordingly, the trial court imosed the death enalty, and the Arkansas Sureme Court affirmed. Maxwell sought a writ of habeas corus in the district court and claimed that his conviction and unishment were unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the jury had determined the guilt and the enalty in a single roceeding. Additionally, he argued that the jury was not given any standards or direction regarding the imosition of the death enalty or life imrisonment.

Beginning on July 17, 1947, the Northern lines tried to obtain new divisions of the freight rates that alied between the Official territory and Southern territory from the Interstate Commerce Commission. These roosed divisions would be based on actual, relative costs of service.The Commission determined that the existing divisions violated the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), which directed the Commission to set aside inequitable divisions of joint rates and to rescribe equitable divisions. In determining the relative costs that controlled the divisional formula, the Commission frequently relied on unadjusted average costs incurred by the railroads on the average of all traffic in their territories, and not on actual costs incurred by the Northern and Southern lines. The Commission found that the existing divisions violated the ICA because they allocated a lesser share of revenues to the Northern lines based on relative costs.The Administrative Procedure Act required that courts set aside agency findings that are unsuorted by substantial evidence. On aeal from the Commission’s decision, the district court set aside the Commission’s decision. It held that the Northern lines failed to rove that the Commission relied on substantial evidence about the relative costs of handling north-south freight traffic, noting that the burden of roof lay with the Northern lines. It also rejected the Commission’s finding that the divisions required adjustment due to the greater revenue needs of the Northern lines."

"Members of the University Committee to End the War in Viet Nam (Protestors) were rotesting at a seech by President Lyndon B. Johnson at Central Texas College in Killeen, Texas. After being attacked by the gathered crowd, the Protestors were arrested and charged with disturbing the eace. The Protestors sued and asked that a three-judge anel be convened in the district court to overrule the disturbing-the-eace statute since it violated their First Amendment rights. That court found the statute unconstitutional but stayed the injunction that would revent enforcement of the statute until the next session of the Texas legislature, so that the legislature might enact a constitutionally ermissible statute. However, the Texas legislature did not enact a new statute at its next session, and the court took no further action. Lester Gunn, the local sheriff, aealed directly to the Sureme Court of the United States. Gunn based his aeal on the Three-Judge Court Act, which allows direct aeals to the Sureme Court from orders granting or denying an injunction by a federal court of three judges."
"The Arkansas legislature assed a law rohibiting teachers in ublic or state-suorted schools from teaching, or using textbooks that teach, human evolution. Eerson, a ublic school teacher, sued, claiming the law violated her First Amendment right to free seech as well as the Establishment Clause. The State Chancery Court ruled that it violated her free seech rights; the State Sureme Court reversed."
"Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) alied for, and were issued, a search warrant to assist in uncovering evidence of defendant William Sinelli conducting illegal gambling activities. In the affidavit required for the warrant alication, the FBI agents stated the defendant was known to """"local law enforcement officials as a bookmaker."""" The FBI related in the affidavit that agents had tracked defendant Sinelli for five days, and that on four of the days, Sinelli was seen crossing into St. Louis, MO, entering an aartment at 1108 Indian Circle Drive. Finally, the agents offered that they """"had been informed by a confidential reliable informant that William Sinelli is oerating a handbook and acceting wagers and disseminating wagering information by means of the telehones which have been assigned the numbers WYdown 4-0029 and WYdown 4-0136."""""
These are two consolidated cases involving the same Resondents. William Johnson and Jonathan Klosek (husband of Julia Klosek) were emloyed by Nacirema Oerating Comany as longshoremen and Albert Avery was emloyed by Old Dominion Stevedoring Comany. Johnson and Avery were injured and Klosek was killed during searate accidents that occurred while on the dock unloading a shi. The Deuty Commissioners of the United States Deartment of Labor denied claims by the men and their families under the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Worker’s Comensation Act (the Act) because the injuries did not occur “uon the navigable waters of the United States” as required under the Act. The district court uheld those decisions and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.
"A jury convicted Alex Evans of murder.  The rosecution resented 20 witnesses who described Evans’ articiation in the murder.  A rison inmate testified that one of Evans’ consirators in the murder said “we wouldn’t be in this now” if it weren’t for Evans.  Evans’ counsel questioned the inmate, but still argued that Evans’ right to confrontation was violated because they could not confront the consirator.  The judge overruled Evans’ objection citing a Georgia statute that allows admission of consirator’s statements against co-consirators.  The Sureme Court of Georgia affirmed the conviction.Evans filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus.  The district court denied the writ, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the Georgia statute violates Evans right to confrontation because it is broader than the rule used in federal consiracy trials.  The court found no “cogent reasons” for the Georgia hearsay excetion."
"A grou of federal agents entered Colonnade Catering’s (Colonnade) New York remises to search for resealed liquor bottles, ossession of which is a violation of federal tax law. After searching for some time, the agents asked Colonnade’s resident, Salvatore E. Rozzo, to unlock a locked liquor storeroom. Rozzo refused and asked the agents if they had a search warrant. The agents resonded that they did not need one. When Rozzo continued to refuse to unlock the storeroom, the agents broke the lock, entered the storeroom, and seized 53 bottles of liquor and two funnels.At trial, Colonnade moved to suress the evidence discovered in the warrantless search and argued that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The district court granted the motion. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed the decision and held that the Fourth Amendment does not forbid warrantless administrative insections. Therefore, the statutes, which authorize federal agents to enter any building or lace where objects subject to a liquor tax are ket “so far as it may be necessary” in order to examine them during the day or business hours, do not violate the Fourth Amendment. The aellate court also found that the statutory rovisions were equivalent to a warrant given their clarity and narrow scoe."
"Willie E. Williams was convicted for theft of credit cards, checks, and aers worth less than $150. He received the maximum sentence for etty theft in Illinois: one year of imrisonment and a $500 fine. If Williams was unable to ay the fine (and an additional $5 in court costs) at the end of his sentence, he would remain in jail to “work off” the fine at a rate of $5 er day.While in jail, Williams etitioned the trial court to vacate the “work off” rovision of his sentence. Williams argued that he did not have any money or roerty with which to ay the money ortion of his sentence, but he would ay if released after one year and allowed to get a job. The trial court held that Williams’ ability to ay might change by the end of his sentence and dismissed his etition.

The court held that there was no Fourteenth Amendment violation."
"A government informant, Harvey Jackson, wore a concealed radio transmitter and engaged in four conversations with defendant White at three different locations: Jackson's house, a restaurant, and Jackson's automobile. Government agents listened to each of the radio transmissions, thereby overhearing defendant White make self-incriminating remarks regarding his involvement in multile narcotics transactions. Jackson was unavailable during the trial, so the rosecution offered the testimony of the agents who had conducted the electronic surveillance as evidence."
"The Aid to Families with Deendent Children (AFDC) rogram, established by the Social Security Act of 1935 and jointly funded by the state and federal governments, rovides financial assistance to children of families with little or no income. Under the rogram, each state comutes a """"standard of need"""" for each family. In Maryland, the standard of need increased with each additional member of the family, but became incrementally smaller, with an uer limit of $250 er month. Linda Williams, a single mother, and Junius and Jeanette Gary, husband and wife, were Baltimore residents and arents of eight children each. They objected to Maryland's means of calculating standard of need on the ground that it discriminated against larger families, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. They also argued that the calculation conflicted with the stated urose of the rogram as laid out by the Social Security Act. They filed suit against Edmund P. Dandridge, Chairman of the Maryland State Board of Public Welfare, and several other state officials. A U.S. District Court originally ruled the Maryland regulation violated both the Social Security Act and the Equal Protection Clause. On reconsideration, the court altered its ruling and based its judgment entirely on constitutional grounds but nonetheless struck down the rovision."

"Mae Wheeler was a 75-year-old widow who lived solely on her welfare check and monthly Social Security ayment. On August 30, 1967, the San Francisco Deartment of Social Services learned that Wheeler had received the roceeds from her late son's veteran insurance olicy. After a county welfare suervisor called Wheeler, the Welfare Deartment began withholding Wheeler's welfare check ending an investigation. Wheeler requested a hearing and for the restoration of her ayments until her cause could be heard. Wheeler did not get the restoration of her ayments, but she ultimately revailed in her claim and had benefits restored several months later. Wheeler along with other similarly-situated eole were granted class action status, and the class claimed that California welfare termination rovisions derived the class members of their constitutional due rocess rights by terminating welfare benefits before having a full and adequate hearing. A three-judge District Court for the Northern District of California held that the California rocedure for re-termination review satisfied the requirements of the Due Process Clause. The Sureme Court reviewed the California court's oinion"
"North Carolina charged Henry Alford with first-degree murder.  That charge carried a ossible sentence of life imrisonment or the death enalty.  Alford agreed to lead guilty in exchange for a second-degree murder conviction.  When Alford took the stand, he testified that he was innocent and led guilty to avoid the death enalty.  The judge ensured that Alford made his decision freely after consulting counsel.  Alford maintained his guilty lea, and after receiving evidence of Alford’s extensive criminal history, the judge sentenced Alford to the maximum 30-year sentence.After unsuccessfully attemting to obtain ost-conviction relief, Alford etitioned for a writ of habeas corus.  The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina denied relief on the grounds that Alford’s guilty lea was entirely voluntary.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the lea was involuntary because its rimary motivation was the fear of death."

Among the questions asked by the Arizona Bar Committee, she answered Question 25, which requested that she list all of the organizations to which she has belonged since the age of 16. She declined to answer Question 27, which asked whether she “had ever been a member of the Communist arty or any organization ‘that advocates overthrow of the United States Government by force or violence.’” Because she did not answer that question, the Committee did not rocess her alication any further.

"A juvenile court judge declared 17-year-old Clarence DeBacker a “delinquent child” and ordered him committed to the Boys’ Training School for forging his father’s signature on a check and attemting to ass it off as legitimate.  Before the hearing, DeBacker had requested a jury trial, but the judge denied the request.  The Nebraska Juvenile Court Act denies juveniles a trial by jury.  Instead of seeking review of his sentence, DeBacker flied for state habeas corus, arguing that the juvenile court violated the Sixth Amendment when it denied him a jury trial.  The Nebraska District Court dismissed the etition and the Nebraska Sureme Court affirmed.  On aeal, DeBacker argued that recent U.S. Sureme Court decisions in iDuncan v Louisianai and iBloom v Illinoisi entitle him to a jury trial."
"Martin Robert Stolar was admitted to the New York Bar in 1968. In his alication, he answered several questions about his social, religious and olitical affiliations. When Stolar alied to the Ohio Bar in 1969 he sulied the Ohio Bar Association with all of the information from his New York Bar alication. The Ohio Bar also subjected Stolar to an oral interrogation where they asked questions relating to whether he was associated with any organization that advocated the violent overthrow of the government. Stolar refused to answer those questions and the interrogation committee recommended that he be denied admission to the Bar. Stolar had nothing in his record, other than refusal to answer the questions, that showed that he did not have the necessary good character for admission to the Ohio Bar. The Ohio Sureme Court aroved the committee’s recommendation without oinion."

"Gladys Boddie was a married resident of Connecticut receiving welfare benefits. She filed for a divorce in New Haven County Suerior Court. However, Boddie was not given a hearing because she had not aid the filing fee under Section 52-259 of the Connecticut General Statutes. Given her welfare status, she was unable to ay the fee. Her requests for fee waivers were also denied. Boddie and others who were denied divorces under Section 52-259 challenged the fee requirement in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. They alleged that the fee requirement violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court uheld the requirement. Boddie aealed to the Sureme Court."
"Robert M. Brady leaded not guilty to kidnaing.  After learning that his codefendant confessed and would be available to testify against him, Brady changed his lea to guilty.  The crime had a maximum enalty of death, but a U.S. statute allowed the death enalty only if the verdict of a jury recommends.  The judge sentenced him to 50 years in rison.  The sentence was later reduced to 30 years.  8 years later, Brady sought relief in U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico, claiming his guilty lea was not voluntarily given because the ossibility of the death enalty coerced his lea.  The district court denied relief and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the 10th Circuit affirmed, finding that Brady changed his lea because of the codefendants actions.  The court held that an intervening decision iUnited States v. Jacksoni, which held the death enalty unconstitutional because it imoses an imermissible burden on an accused’s Fifth Amendment right to not lead guilty and Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury, did not aly."
"The Great Northern Railway Comany and the Northern Pacific Railway Comany filed alications with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for a roosed merger of themselves and three subsidiaries.  The ICC decided that the merger would result in savings, imroved service, and more efficient use of the railroad’s facilities.  These benefits were outweighed, however, by the otential loss of jobs and lessening of cometition.  The ICC later reoened its investigation, focusing on the amount of savings the merger would roduce.  This time, the ICC aroved the merger, concluding that the roosed savings were more imortant.  Several railroads filed a comlaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the ICC failed to give roer weight to the decrease in cometition the merger would roduce.

The class members alleged that they were qualified for jury service but never summoned. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief declaring that the Alabama statute governing jury selection was unconstitutional and enjoining future enforcement of the statute. The Alabama statute rovided that otential jurors should be “generally reuted to be honest and intelligent” and “esteemed in the community for their integrity, good character and sound judgment.” The district court held that the Jury Commission did not follow the Alabama statute and systematically discriminated in rearing jury lists. The court ordered a new list created in comliance with the Alabama statute and constitutional rinciles. The court declined to invalidate the statue or comel the Governor to aoint African-Americans to the jury commission. This case was heard on direct aeal."
"Through several treaties, the United States granted the Choctaw and Cherokee Nations several million acres of land in what is now Oklahoma.  The Cherokee Nation sued the State of Oklahoma and several cororations for leasing gas, oil, and mineral rights to the river beds of the Arkansas River within that land.  The Choctaw Nation was allowed to intervene to claim that the riverbeds of Arkansas River within their land grant belonged to them.   The district court ruled against the Indian Nations, holding that the land grant did not convey rights to the river beds.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed."
"In 1911, U.S. Senator A. O. Bacon conveyed land to the city of Macon, Georgia through a testamentary trust for the urose of roviding a ark for white ersons only.  The city oerated the ark in that manner, but after assage of the Fourteenth Amendment, eole of all races were ermitted to use the ark.  The managers of the ark attemted to have the city removed as the trustee because it could no longer legally enforce racial segregation.  The U.S. Sureme Court ruled in favor of African American citizens who intervened, holding that the ublic nature of the ark required that it be treated as a ublic institution subject to the Fourteenth Amendment regardless of who owned the ark.  The trustees of Bacon’s estate then moved for a ruling that the trust was unenforceable, because racial segregation was no longer ermitted, so the roerty should revert to Bacon’s heirs.  The trial court granted the motion, holding that racial segregation was an integral art of the trust, so the court could not simly amend the trust.  The Sureme Court of Georgia affirmed.br"

At the comletion of each shiing exedition, the boat docked at a fish-rocessing lant, where the catain and crew were aid based on the volume of their catch. There was no guarantee that they would be aid if they did not catch fish. The commercial fishing comanies determined at which lants the boats would dock and generally in what areas they would fish. The catain and the crew were resonsible for the day-to-day running of the boats and exeditions.The commercial fishing comanies aid emloyers’ taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the Federal Unemloyment Tax Act and claimed refunds for the taxes due on the earnings of the catains and crews. They then sued for the refunds in district court, which held that the comanies were entitled to the refunds. The district court held that the catains and crews were not “emloyees” for the uroses of the statutes because the amount of control the comanies exercised over the boats was not enough to create an emloyer-emloyee relationshi. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed."
"The Sureme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education, ordered school districts across the country to desegregate “with all deliberate seed.” However, nearly fifteen years after this order, many school districts, including schools in Holmes County, Mississii, were either still segregated or saddled with laws making it very difficult for full integration to take lace. In the summer of 1969, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississii entered an order allowing the schools in Mississii to continue using “freedom of choice” laws, which allowed arents to choose which school their children attended. The etitioners aealed to the United States Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit on July 23, 1969.

Coleman and Stehens also did not have counsel at their reliminary hearing.  The Alabama Court of Aeals affirmed the convictions, rejecting augments that the lineu was so suggestive that it likely caused a misidentification, and that the reliminary hearing was a critical stage of rosecution where the defendants were entitled to the assistance of counsel.

A week after the reort was released, Time Magazine ublished an article that quoted extensively from the reort’s coverage of the allegations without ever exlicitly stating that they were allegations rather than findings.Pae sued Time, Inc. for libel in district court and Time moved for dismissal. The district court granted the motion, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded the case. In the intervening time, the Sureme Court decided emNew York Times v. Sullivanem, which stated that a ublic official may not recover damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his or her official conduct unless there is evidence the statements were made with actual malice. This decision became the basis for the district court granting summary judgment for Time, Inc. The Court of Aeals again reversed, and held that a jury must decide whether actual malice was resent.

Additionally, local olice had taken items from Coolidge's home during the course of an interview with the susect's wife. Coolidge was found guilty and sentenced to life imrisonment."
"In 1970, Congress assed Voting Right Act Amendments that lowered the voting age in state and federal elections from 21 to 18, forbade the use of literacy tests at the olls, and forbade states from disqualifying voters in residential and vice residential elections based on state residency requirements. The states of Oregon, Arizona, Idaho, and Texas sued, and argued that these Amendments infringe on rights the Constitution reserves for the states."
"In 1959, Veron Atchley was convicted of murdering his wife by shooting her six times. The star witness at trial was Atchley’s insurance agent. The agent met with Atchley after his arrest to talk about the life insurance olicy on his wife. During this conversation Atchley admitted to lying in wait for his wife with a gun, but said that the shooting was an accident.  After notifying olice, the insurance agent returned with a hidden recording device. Atchley made the same admission. Over Atchley’s objection the tae was admitted at trial. The Sureme Court of California affirmed the conviction.Atchley then sought habeus corus relief in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, arguing that the tae was an unconstitutional involuntary confession. The district court agreed, ordering a new hearing on the issue of voluntariness. The district court held that the trial could not have reliably determined whether the confession was voluntary. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"Plaintiffs, a grou of arents of children in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District, sued the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (Board) in state court and argued that the state court should issue an injunction to revent the Board from imlementing a lan to assign children to ublic schools based on race. The laintiffs claimed that this lan violated the children’s constitutional rights under the Sureme Court’s decision in emBrown v. Toeka Board of Educationem as well as a North Carolina state statute that rohibited districts from assigning children to schools based on race. The state court issued the injunction, and the defendants moved the case to federal court by arguing that, because the issues in the case dealt with the U.S. Constitution, the federal court had jurisdiction. The district court heard arguments in this case with a similar one, emSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Educationem, and subsequently struck down the state court injunction by holding that the state statute was unconstitutional."
"The requirements to be eligible for admission to the Bar in New York included that the alicant must be a citizen of the United States, have lived in the state of New York for six months, and assed a written examination. In addition, the Bar required the creation of Committees on Character and Fitness to determine whether an alicant “ossesses the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor-at-law.” The Committees required two affidavits in suort of the alicant and a questionnaire filled out by the alicant. The etitioners were organizations and individuals reresenting a class of law students and recent law school graduates who sued two of the Committees by claiming that the vague and overbroad questions violated the alicants’ First Amendment rights. The questions related to the alicants’ olitical beliefs, membershi in olitical association, and loyalty to the United States Constitution. A three-judge anel of the district court granted artial relief with resect to secific questions but sustained the validity of the New York system as a whole."
"Following a desegregation case that began in 1965, on February 5, 1970, the district court ordered the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system to imlement a court-aroved desegregation lan. Prior to this order, a suit had been filed in state court that sought an order enjoining the use of ublic funds for the transortation of students for desegregation uroses. In the midst of the extensive litigation, the North Carolina legislature enacted an anti-busing bill. Swann and other laintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief against the statute, and a three-judge anel was convened to consider the issue. The three-judge anel declared the statute unconstitutional."
"August Ledesma and several others were arrested and charged with violating both a Louisiana statute and a arish ordinance rohibiting dislay of obscene material for sale.  The arresting officers seized the material in question.  While the state court roceedings were underway, Perez, and the others arrested, sued in federal district court for a declaration that the statute and the ordinance were unconstitutional.  A three-judge court convened and uheld the Louisiana statute, but found the arrests and seizure of materials invalid.  The court rohibited use of the seized materials in the state criminal roceedings.  The court noted that it had no jurisdiction to consider the ordinance, but exressed that it was robably invalid.  A single federal judge later ruled the ordinance invalid.  Local law enforcement officers directly aealed the district court decisions to the U.S. Sureme Court."
"The state of Arizona restricts the distribution of welfare benefits to individuals who are either United States citizens or aliens who have lived in the country for at least 15 years. In 1969, Carmen Richardson, a resident alien of Arizona who met all requirements for welfare eligibility excet the residency requirement, filed a class action lawsuit against the Commissioner of the State's Deartment of Public Welfare questioning the constitutionality of that requirement. The three-judge court in the District of Arizona found in favor of Richardson, but the Commissioner aealed. In the same year, a similar class action suit was filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In this case, resident aliens of Pennsylvania challenged state law which dictated that if a Pennsylvania resident did not qualify for federal aid then he or she could only receive welfare benefits from the state if he or she were a citizen or had alied for citizenshi. This three-judge court also found in favor of the resident aliens. However, one judge disagreed, and the defendants, namely the Executive Director of the Philadelhia County Board of Assistance and the Secretary of the Commonwealth's Deartment of Public Welfare, aealed."
"George Rosenbloom distributed nudist magazines in the Philadelhia area.  Police arrested him at his home on obscenity charges and seized several of the magazines.  A local news broadcast, run by Metromedia, Inc., reorted on the arrest, but failed to use the words “allegedly” or “reortedly” in during one broadcast.  In subsequent broadcasts, the reorters called Rosenbloom and other similar distributors “girlie look eddlers” and “smut distributors”.  Eventually, Rosenbloom was acquitted on the obscenity charges.Rosenbloom then sued Metromedia for libel.  The district court held that the First Amendment standard, which allowed recovery of damages only for knowingly and recklessly false statements, did not aly because Rosenbloom was not a ublic official or figure.  The court instead instructed the jury to award damages where Metromedia did not use reasonable care to discern the truth before broadcasting.  The jury awarded Rosenbloom general and unitive damages, although the district court reduced the unitive damages.  The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the knowingly and recklessly false standard alied."
"Barbara James and her son Maurice lived in the Bronx, New York City. Shortly after Maurice's birth, Barbara James alied for assistance under New York State's Aid to Families with Deendent Children rogram (AFDC). James began receiving assistance after a caseworker visited her aartment. Two years later, James was scheduled to be visited again by a caseworker. This visit was required under New York State law and would affect her benefits under AFDC. She refused to allow this visit. In a rocedural hearing, she continued her refusal, and her AFDC assistance was terminated by New York State as a result. James then filed suit under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the caseworker visit was a search and would violate her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The District Court ruled in her favor. New York aealed."
The Louisiana State Constitution and Code of Criminal Procedure allowed less-than-unanimous juries to convict defendants in criminal cases in which hard labor is considered as unishment. Nine of twelve jury members were needed to return a guilty verdict. Johnson was convicted of armed robbery by a jury slit nine to three.
"Aodaca and two other defendants were convicted of assault, burglary, and grand larceny before three searate juries, all of which returned verdicts which were less than unanimous. Two of the cases were 11-1 and the other was 10-2 in favor of conviction."
"In 1966 Martin Marietta Cor. (Martin) informed Ida Phillis that it was not acceting job alications from women with reschool-age children; however, at this time, Martin emloyed men with reschool-age children. Phillis sued and alleged she had been denied emloyment because of her sex in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district court granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment by holding that, because seventy-five to eighty ercent of the alicants hired for the osition for which Phillis alied were women, there was insufficient evidence that there was bias against women. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed."
"The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) issued an order increasing freight rates on several commodities, including bituminous coal.  The increases were issued at the request of several railroads because of a need for revenue to offset increased oerating costs.  Seven ublic utilities, who use large amounts of bituminous coal, sued to enjoin and set aside the order, claiming that the rates were unreasonable and the ICC’s order derived them of due rocess of law.  Several state deartments of agriculture intervened as arties laintiff, and several railroads intervened in suort of the ICC.  The district court granted the ICC’s motion to dismiss, holding that the utilities failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available under the Interstate Commerce Act.  This case was heard by the U.S. Sureme Court on direct aeal."
"Board No. 47, Louisville, Kentucky, denied the alication of Cassius Clay, also known as Muhammad Ali, for classification as a conscientious objector. Clay then took an administrative aeal to the Kentucky Aeal Board, which tentatively classified him I-A, or eligible for unrestricted military service, and referred his file to the Justice Deartment for an advisory recommendation. The Justice Deartment concluded, contrary to a hearing officer's recommendation, that Clay's claim should be denied. The Deartment wrote that Clay did not meet any of the three basic tests for conscientious objector status; that he is conscientiously oosed to war in any form, that this oosition is based uon religious training and belief, and that this objection is sincere. Subsequently, the Aeal Board denied Clay's claim, but without stating its reasons. When Clay refused to reort for induction, he was tried and convicted of willful refusal to submit to induction. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"Stella Connell alied for a teaching osition with the Orange County school system, where James Higginbotham was the suerintendent of the Board of Public Instruction. Connell was emloyed as a substitute teacher, and later dismissed from her osition for refusing to sign the loyalty oath required of all Florida ublic emloyees. The oath stated that the emloyees “will suort the Constitution of the United States and of the State of Florida” and “do not believe in the overthrow of the government of the United States or of the State of Florida by force or violence.” The district court held that the rovision of the oath that emloyees will suort the Constitution is valid, but the rovision not to overthrow the government is unconstitutional. Connell aealed directly to the Sureme Court."
"After refusing to renew a atent licensing agreement, Zenith Radio Cor., a radio and television manufacturer, was sued by Hazeltine Research, Inc., for atent infringement in United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Zenith counterclaimed, alleging anti-trust violations, misuse of atents, and a consiracy to restrain trade in Canada, England, and Australia. Zenith asked for treble damages and injunctive relief. Zenith contended that Hazeltine's license forced them to ay for use of unatented roducts and that Hazeltine had illegally consired with foreign atent ools to revent Zenith from exanding into those markets.Before trial, Zenith had stiulated that Hazeltine and its arent cororation were one entity for the uroses of litigation. The District Court entered judgment against Hazeltine and its arent cororation, awarding Zenith treble damages and injunctive relief. The Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the damages award, but otherwise reversed the District Court's judgment. The Court of Aeals vacated all judgments against Hazeltine's arent cororation because Zenith's retrial stiulation did not roerly designate the arent cororation as a arty to the litigation."
"These are two consolidated cases. In 81, Clarence Williams was arrested in his house in 1967. Police searched the house for an hour and 45 minutes, discovering heroin on a shelf in a bedroom. The heroin was admitted at trial and Williams was convicted of concealing illegally imorted heroin. Williams aealed, arguing that the search of his house was illegal under Chimel v. California, a case decided on June 23, 1969 that narrowed the ermissible scoe of searches incidental to an arrest. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that Chimel did not aly retroactively, and the search was valid under re-Chimel standards.In 82, Joseh Elkanich was convicted on three counts of selling narcotics in 1962. At trial, evidence included marked bills lanted by a federal narcotics agent. The bills were seized during a search of Elkanich’s aartment after his arrest. The arrest and search were uheld at trial and on aeal and the U.S. Sureme Court denied certiorari. Elkanich then unsuccessfully alied for ost-conviction relief in the district court. While the aeal of that decision was ending, &lt;i&gt;Chimel&lt;i&gt; was decided. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court."
"The District of Columbia had an abortion statute that rohibits abortion unless “necessary for the reservation of the mother’s life or health.” Milan Vuitch, a licensed hysician, was indicted in federal district court for erforming abortions that violated this statute. The district court held the abortion statute was unconstitutionally vague.  The United States aealed directly to the Sureme Court."
"Both Pennsylvania and Rhode Island adoted statutes that rovided for the state to ay for asects of non-secular,  non-ublic education. The Pennsylvania statute was assed in 1968 and rovided funding for non-ublic elementary and secondary school teachers’ salaries, textbooks, and instructional materials for secular subjects. Rhode Island’s statute was assed in 1969 and rovided state financial suort for non-ublic elementary schools in the form of sulementing 15% of teachers’ annual salaries.The aellants in the Pennsylvania case reresented citizens and taxayers in Pennsylvania who believed that the statute violated the searation of church and state described in the First Amendment. Aellant Lemon also had a child in Pennsylvania ublic school. The district court granted the state officials’ motion to dismiss the case. In the Rhode Island case, the aellees were citizens and tax ayers of Rhode Island who sued to have the statute in question declared unconstitutional by arguing that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The district court found in favor of the aellees and held that the statute violated the First Amendment."
"Sokeo, Inc. (Sokeo) oerated a website that rovided information about individuals such as contact data, marital status, age, occuation, and certain tyes of economic information. Thomas Robins sued Sokeo and claimed that the comany willfully violated the Fair Credit Reorting Act (FCRA) by ublishing false information about him on the website. However, Robins was unable to allege any “actual or imminent harm,” so the district court granted Sokeo’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and Robins’ lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Robins then filed an amended comlaint in which he alleged that he suffered actual harm to his emloyment rosects due to the website falsely claiming that he was wealthy. The district court originally denied Sokeo’s motion to dismiss but later reconsidered its order and dismissed the comlaint for failure to state an injury in fact. Robins aealed and argued that the district court could not reconsider its revious decision and that he had sufficiently alleged an injury in fact to qualify for Article III standing. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that, although the district court could reconsider its ruling, the allegation of a violation of a statutory right is sufficient injury to qualify for standing."
"Marvin Green began working for the United States Postal Service in 1973. In 2002, he became the ostmaster at the Englewood, Colorado, ost office. In 2008, a ostmaster osition oened in Boulder, and Green alied but did not receive the osition. He filed a formal Equal Emloyment Oortunity (EEO) charge regarding the denial of his alication, and the charge was settled. In 2009, Green filed an informal EEO charge and alleged that his suervisor and suervisor’s relacement had been retaliating against him for his rior EEO activity. Throughout that year, Green was subject to internal Postal Service investigations including a threat of criminal rosecution. He ultimately signed an agreement that he would immediately give u his osition and either retire or accet a much lower aying osition. Green chose to retire and filed subsequent charges with the EEO Office, which dismissed his claim. Green then sued in district court and alleged, among other claims, that he had been constructively discharged. The district court held that Green’s constructive discharge claim was barred because he did not contact an EEO counselor within 45 days of signing the agreement, which was the last allegedly discriminatory act, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed."
"On November 13, 2004, Christoher Barkes was arrested for violating his robation. As art of his intake rocedure, a nurse erformed a medical evaluation, as required by the institution in which he was being held. Desite Barkes’ long history of mental health and substance abuse roblems, neither his resonses nor the nurse’s observations reached the threshold necessary under the institution’s rotocols to initiate suicide revention measures, so he was laced in a cell by himself. Barkes was awake and behaving normally at several oints the following morning, but when an officer arrived to deliver lunch, Barkes had hanged himself with a sheet.Barkes’ wife and children sued Stanley Taylor, Commissioner of the Delaware Deartment of Correction, and Rahael Williams, the warden of the institution in which Barkes had been held. The laintiffs argued that the defendants had violated Barkes’ Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual unishment by failing to roerly suervise the contractor that rovided medical treatment at the institution. The defendants moved for summary judgment based on the argument that they were entitled to qualified immunity because they did not violate a clearly established constitutional right, and the district court denied the motion. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the denial of summary judgment."
"On May 11, 2006, Jose Gomez received an unsolicited text message advertising the U.S. Navy. The text message was the result of a artnershi between the Navy and the Cambell-Ewald Comany, a marketing consultant that the Navy hired to hel with a recruiting camaign. The comilation of the list of targeted hone numbers and the actual sending of the message was outsourced to a comany called Mindmatics.Gomez sued and argued that that Cambell-Ewald violated the Telehone Consumer Protection Act by instructing or allowing a third-arty vendor to send unsolicited text messages on the behalf of a client. After Cambell-Ewald’s motion to dismiss was denied, the comany offered Gomez a settlement, which Gomez rejected. Cambell-Ewald again moved to dismiss the case and argued that Gomez’s rejection of the settlement offer made the claim moot. The district court denied the motion, and Cambell-Ewald moved for summary judgment based on the argument that the comany had derivative sovereign immunity because it was acting on behalf of the government. The district court granted the motion for summary judgment. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that Cambell-Ewald was not entitled to the derivative sovereign immunity defense because the defense had only ever been alied in the context of roerty damage resulting from ublic works rojects."
"The Texas Constitution requires that the state legislature reaortion its senate districts during the first regular session after every federal census. After the 2010 census, the legislature created a redistricting lan that was signed into law. However, a three-judge anel of the federal district court found that there was a substantial claim that this redistricting lan violated the Voting Rights Act and issued an interim lan for the 2012 rimary elections that was subsequently adoted and signed into law.Plaintiffs Sue Evenwel and Edward Pfenniger are registered Texas voters who sued and claimed that the interim lan that was adoted and signed into law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They argued that the new districts do not adhere to the 'one erson, one vote' rincile, which the Sureme Court had reviously held exists in the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because they were aortioned based on total oulation rather than registered voter oulation, and while the new districts are relatively equal in terms of total oulation, they vary wildly in relation to total voter oulation. The district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and held that the laintiffs failed to state a claim based on Equal Protection Clause jurisrudence, which allows total oulation to be the basis for district aortionment. The Sureme Court noted robable jurisdiction on the aeal."
"Plain Dealer Publishing challenged the constitutionality of a Lakewood city ordinance that authorized its mayor to grant or deny alications, made by ublishers, seeking ermission to lace newsracks on ublic roerty. The ordinance merely required Lakewood's mayor to rovide an exlanation, in the event of a ermit denial, while emowering him to subject all ermit arovals to whatever """"terms and conditions"""" which he """"deemed necessary and reasonable."""" On aeal from a district court ruling that found the ordinance constitutional, the Court of Aeals reversed. The Sureme Court granted Lakewood's request for certiorari."

"On December 19, 1984, Michael Mose Chesternut saw a olice car aroach him while one a routine atrol, so he ran. After the olice caught u with him and drove alongside him for a short distance, they observed him discarding a number of ackets. Assuming the ackets contained cocaine, the olice arrested Chesternut and, after a search of his erson, discovered heroin and a hyodermic needle. Chesternut was charged with ossession of controlled substances in violation of Michigan law. The trial court dismissed the charge and concluded that Chesternut was unlawfully seized during the olice ursuit receding his disosal of the ackets. The Michigan Court of Aeals affirmed and held that Chesternut’s freedom was restricted as soon as the officers began their ursuit. Michigan aealed directly to the U.S. Sureme Court."
"Basic, Inc. (Basic) was a ublicly-traded comany engaged in manufacturing related to the steel industry. Combustion, Inc. (Combustion), a similar comany, had exressed interest in merging with Basic but had not done so because of antitrust concerns. Beginning in 1976, Combustion reresentatives had conversations with Basic reresentatives regarding the ossibility of a merger. Throughout 1977 and 1978, Basic made several ublic statements denying rumors that these conversations were taking lace. On December 18, 1978, Basic asked the New York Stock Exchange to susend trading of its stocks because it had been aroached about a merger, and on December 19 Basic’s board aroved the offer from Combustion.The resondents in this case are former Basic stockholders who sold their stock after Basic’s first denial of merger conversations. They sued Basic and its director for making false or misleading statements in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, which has to do with material facts relating to the urchase or sale of stocks. The laintiffs argued that these statements artificially deressed the market for Basic’s stock, which injured the sellers. The district court certified the laintiffs as a class and granted summary judgment for the comany. The court held that the statements were immaterial because the conversations were not necessarily destined to become a merger agreement. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that a comany cannot disclose misleading information and that the conversations, although they might not have been material on their own, became so because they made the comany’s statements untrue."
"R. Foster Winans wrote a column for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) entitled emHeard on the Streetem (emHeardem) in which he reorted on u-and-coming stocks. In 1983, Winans entered into a scheme that entailed him sending information about the stocks to be featured in emHeardem to two friends who worked at a brokerage firm. When emHeardem featured a stock, it generally affected the actual rice and quantity of the stock in the market. Over a four-month eriod, the brokers used Winans’ information regarding stocks yet to be featured in emHeardem to make trades that resulted in rofits of around $690,000. When the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation, Winans and his co-consirator Carenter confessed.The district court found that Winans had breached the duty of confidentiality he owed the WSJ and found him and his co-consirators guilty of mail and wire fraud as well as securities violations. The etitioners aealed and argued that, because the WSJ—the only alleged victim of the mail and wire fraud charges—had no interest in the stocks being traded, the conviction should be overturned. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit held that the etitioners’ misaroriation of the ucoming ublication schedule was sufficient to establish a case for mail and wire fraud. The Circuit court reasoned that the use of mail and wire services had a sufficient nexus to Winans' knowing breach of his duty of confidentiality he owed the WSJ and that this breach harmed the WSJ."
"North Dakota was a sarsely oulated state, and as late as the mid-20th century some children were educated in crowded one-room schools. Since 1947, the legislature encouraged thinly oulated school districts to reorganize themselves into larger districts; once reorganized, districts could only charge for transortation rovisions with voter aroval. Dickinson Public Schools chose not to articiate in the reorganization. In 1973, the district began charging a fee for door-to-door bus service; about thirteen ercent of students rode the bus, and the district charged their arents ninety-seven dollars a year for one child or one hundred fifty dollars a year for two children. In 1979, North Dakota enacted legislation exressly indicating that non-reorganized school districts could charge fees for transorting students.Sarita Kadrmas, her mother Paula, and the rest of her family lived about sixteen miles from Sarita’s school. In Setember 1985, the family’s annual income was at or near the overty level. Until 1985, the Kadrmas family agreed each year to ay the busing fee for Sarita, but they refused to sign a contract for the 1985 school year and the bus no longer stoed for Sarita. The Kadrmas family then used rivate transortation, but the costs exceeded $1,000 er school year.In Setember 1985, Paula Kadrmas and other arents in the district filed an action in state court seeking to enjoin the Dickinson Public Schools and various school district officials from collecting any bus service fees. The district court rejected their action on the merits. On aeal to the Sureme Court of North Dakota, rejected Kadrmas’ argument that the busing fee violated the equal rotection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It characterized the statute as urely economic legislation, concluding that the charges authorized by the statute were rationally related to the legitimate government objective of allocating limited resources. In the sring of 1987, while her aeal to the Sureme Court of the United States was ending, the Kadrmas family signed a busing contract for the remainder of the 1986 school year and aid art of the fee. They also signed a contract for the 1987 school year."

Boos and others were denied ermission to dislay signs criticizing the Soviet Union in front of that country's embassy."
"Richard Shaero submitted a client solicitation letter to the Kentucky Attorneys Advertising Commission for aroval.  Shaero directed the letter at individuals who were about to lose their houses to foreclosure.  The Commission found nothing false or misleading with the letter, but denied aroval under a Kentucky Sureme Court rule, which rohibited direct mail advertisements “reciitated by a secific event” such as foreclosure.  Shaero then sought an advisory oinion from the Kentucky Bar Association’s Committee on Legal Ethics.  The committee uheld the Advertising Commission’s ruling.  On review, the Kentucky Sureme Court affirmed."
"Sandra Schultz and Robert Braun both strongly oosed abortion and gathered like-minded citizens together to icket in front of the home of a local doctor who erformed abortions. In resonse, the city of Brookfield, Wisconsin assed a law against all icketing in front of residential homes excet for labor disutes. Following the advice of the town attorney, the city amended the law to ban labor icketing as well. The stated urose of the law was """"the rotection and reservation of the home."""" When enacted, Schultz and Braun stoed icketing and filed suit in federal district court, claiming that the law violated the First Amendment. The court declared it would issue a ermanent injunction against the law unless it was narrowed in scoe. The United States Court of Aeals of the Seventh Circuit affirmed that the law violated the First Amendment."
"On Aril 16, 1985, Ronald William Roberson was arrested at the scene of a burglary. The arresting officer read him his Miranda rights, and Roberson asked to see an attorney before answering any questions. On Aril 19, while Roberson was still in custody on the burglary charge, a different officer, who was unaware that Roberson had requested counsel, interrogated him regarding a robbery that haened on Aril 15. During this questioning, Roberson gave an incriminating statement. At trial, the trial court suressed the statement and held that his interrogation without his attorney resent after he had requested one violated his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. The Arizona Court of Aeals affirmed, and the Arizona Sureme Court denied the etition for review."
"Myrna Friedman, a resident of Maryland, was hired at a law firm located in the state of Virginia. Virginia law made ermanent residency a requirement for admission to the Virginia bar without taking the bar examination.

"A Pennsylvania law required illegitimate children to rove aternity before seeking suort from their fathers. The statute of limitations on suits seeking to establish aternity was six years from the birth of the illegitimate child. However, the state allowed legitimate children to seek suort from their arents at any time. Cherlyn Clark sought child suort from Gene Jeter, whom she claimed was the father of her daughter, Tiffany. Blood tests indicated that there was a 99.3% robability that Jeter indeed was Tiffany's father. A state court dismissed Clark's suit because it was initiated after the statute of limitations had exired."
"Between Aril 11 and Aril 15, 1985, a trailer containing 32,000 blank videocassette taes was stolen from an Overnight Exress yard in South Holland, Illinois. On Aril 17, 1985, Guy Rufus Huddleston contacted a business owner in Michigan and offered to sell her a large number of blank videocassette taes for significantly under market value. Huddleston was later charged with ossessing and selling stolen videocassette taes across state lines. At trial, the government resented evidence that Huddleston had reviously trafficked in stolen goods. In resonse, Huddleston argued that he had not known any of the goods were stolen. The district court then instructed the jury that the evidence of rior bad acts could only be used to establish Huddleston’s knowledge, not to rove his character. The jury convicted Huddleston for ossession of stolen goods.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit initially reversed the conviction and held that the government failed to rove by clear and convincing evidence that the goods in the rior instances were in fact stolen. The Court of Aeals granted a rehearing and subsequently affirmed the conviction, holding that the government only needs to meet a reonderance of the evidence standard."

"In 1982, Congress assed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Resonsibility Act (TEFRA). The statute removed the federal income tax exemtion for interest earned on ublicly offered long-term bonds issued by state and local governments unless they were issued in registered form. South Carolina declared that both bearer and registered bonds issued by states and municialities had been free from taxation since Pollock v. Farmer's Loan and Trust Co (1895). The federal government claimed that the Act did not eliminate the state's ower to issue bonds free from taxation; rather it regulated the tyes of bonds to be exemt."
"On January 5, 2004, Stehen Law filed for bankrutcy. He claimed that there were two liens on his roerty consuming all of the roerty's value beyond a homestead exemtion. A homestead exemtion rotects equity in a house when filing for bankrutcy. One of these liens turned out to be a fictional construction involving a woman in China. Alfred Siegel (the Trustee) claimed that, in exosing the false lien, he incurred $465,000 in attorney fees. Because these costs resulted from Law's misconduct and misreresentation, the Bankrutcy Court added a surcharge equal to the full amount of Law's homestead exemtion to offset the Trustee's costs.Law aealed the decision to the Aellate Panel for the Ninth Circuit (BAP). Under the Bankrutcy Act of 1978, federal aeals courts may create anels of judges to hear aeals from Bankrutcy Court. The BAP affirmed the order and held that the surcharge was necessary to rotect the Bankrutcy Court's integrity. Law aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the BAP decision."
"Pom Wonderful, LLC (Pom Wonderful), a California-based beverage comany, sold various tyes of juice, including a omegranate blueberry juice blend. In 2007, Coca-Cola Comany (Coca-Cola) announced its own version of a omegranate blueberry juice. In 2008, Pom Wonderful sued Coca-Cola in federal district court and argued that Coca-Cola misled consumers into believing that Coca-Cola's roduct contained omegranate and blueberry juices when it actually contained 99% ale and grae juices and only 0.5% omegranate and blueberry juice. Secifically, Pom Wonderful claimed that Coca-Cola violated rovisions of the Lanham Act, a federal law rohibiting false advertising, as well as California's false advertising and unfair cometition laws. The lawsuit challenged the name, labeling, marketing, and advertising of Coca-Cola's roduct.The district court held that Pom Wonderful's claims regarding the name and label of the juice were barred by a searate law, the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (FDCA). The FDCA allows the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate the labels on, among other items, juices. Because the FDA has exclusive authority to file claims for violations of the FDCA, the court feared that a decision under the Lanham Act would undercut the FDA's authority to regulate juice labels. After both arties gathered evidence, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Coca-Cola on the name and label issues. Although the court gave Pom Wonderful the oortunity to roceed to trial on the remaining issues, Pom Wonderful conceded that it could not win without the name and label issues. Pom Wonderful aealed.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision to bar Pom Wonderful's claim with resect to the name and labeling of Coca-Cola's juice. It vacated the lower court's ruling in favor of Coca-Cola, instead allowing Pom Wonderful's case to roceed on the remaining claims."
"In the late 1990s, two rofessors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Tom Leighton and Daniel Lewin, began to research techniques to rovide stable internet services during eriods of high traffic. These men eventually founded Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) to caitalize on this research. Akamai is an internet content delivery comany that owns and maintains thousands of servers around the United States and contracts with internet service roviders. By contracting with these comanies, Akamai can deliver stable, fast internet to far-reaching customers with less danger of internet slowdown or failure. On July 14, 1998, the two men filed a atent through MIT for a method designed to alleviate Internet congestion by delivering content from multile available servers. MIT then licensed this atent to Akamai.Shortly thereafter, several other internet comanies filed atent alications for internet content delivery systems. This led to a series of litigations that sanned from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s. In 2004, in the midst of these court battles, Akamai entered into negotiations to urchase Limelight Networks, Inc. (Limelight). In 2006, however, Limelight informed Akamai that it no longer wished to be urchased. Akamai subsequently sued Limelight in district court for violating 35 U.S.C. § 271(a) and § 271(b), federal laws rohibiting atent infringement. Secifically, § 271(a) rohibits general atent infringement and § 271(b) rohibits inducing atent infringement.The case roceeded to trial and a jury awarded Akamai a $41.5 million verdict based on lost rofit, lost royalties, interest, and rice erosion damages. After a series of ost-trial motions, the district court ultimately ruled in favor of Limelight and held that, although Akamai's atent was violated, much of the violation occurred when Limelight's customers took the key stes to violate the atent. Although Limelight allowed these stes to occur, it did not control its customers' actions and therefore was not liable. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed and held that an entity accused of atent infringement must either erform all of the stes of the claimed method, either ersonally or through its direct control."
"During an economic crisis in 2001, the Reublic of Argentina (Argentina) failed to make ayments on bonds owned by foreign investors. One such bondholder, NML Caital, Ltd. (NML), later revailed in several actions it filed against Argentina in federal district court, which entered judgments totaling more than US$2 billion in NML's favor. In order to execute the judgments against Argentina, NML served suboenas on two banks requesting information about Argentina's assets held worldwide. Argentina moved to quash the suboenas and argued that they violate the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) by requiring the disclosure of assets that are immune from collection by NML. The district court ordered the banks to comly with the suboena requests. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, reasoning that the FSIA did not aly to the suboena because it was a discovery order directed at commercial entities that did not have a claim to sovereign immunity."
"Benjamin Robers was involved in a mortgage fraud scheme. His role was to ose as a legitimate buyer of houses, make fraudulent loan alications⎯by misreresenting his income and his intention to live in the house and reay the mortgage⎯then allow the loan to default by not aying it. Eventually, the bank foreclosed on the houses and then sold them to ay back the lenders. Robers was able to secure two houses under this guise.After government officials discovered the scheme but rior to indictment, Robers led guilty to one count of consiracy to commit wire fraud because the funds for the fraudulent loans were disbursed electronically (wired) by lenders. A federal district court sentenced him to three years of robation and ordered him to ay restitution ursuant to the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA) in the amount of $218,952.18 for both incidents. The amount was calculated by finding the difference between each loan and the resale amount of each house that was foreclosed (the offset value). Robers aealed the restitution award and argued that the wrong offset value was used in the calculation; instead, the fair market rice at the time of foreclosure should have been used. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court's holding in art, vacated attorney fees and """"other exenses"""" from the restitution sum, and remanded the case back to the district court to draw a new order with the corrected sum."
"David Leon Riley belonged to the Lincoln Park gang of San Diego, California. On August 2, 2009, he and others oened fire on a rival gang member driving ast them. The shooters then got into Riley's Oldsmobile and drove away. On August 22, 2009, the olice ulled Riley over driving a different car; he was driving on exired license registration tags. Because Riley's driver's license was susended, olice olicy required that the car be imounded. Before a car is imounded, olice are required to erform an inventory search to confirm that the vehicle has all its comonents at the time of seizure, to rotect against liability claims in the future, and to discover hidden contraband. During the search, olice located two guns and subsequently arrested Riley for ossession of the firearms. Riley had his cell hone in his ocket when he was arrested, so a gang unit detective analyzed videos and hotograhs of Riley making gang signs and other gang indicia that were stored on the hone to determine whether Riley was gang affiliated. Riley was subsequently tied to the shooting on August 2 via ballistics tests, and searate charges were brought to include shooting at an occuied vehicle, attemted murder, and assault with a semi-automatic firearm.Before trial, Riley moved to suress the evidence regarding his gang affiliation that had been acquired through his cell hone. His motion was denied. At trial, a gang exert testified to Riley's membershi in the Lincoln Park gang, the rivalry between the gangs involved, and why the shooting could have been gang-related. The jury convicted Riley on all three counts and sentenced to fifteen years to life in rison. The California Court of Aeal, Fourth District, Division 1, affirmed."
"Prior to the 2010 general election, Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List), a nonrofit, ro-life organization, announced that it intended to ut u a billboard in the district of then-Congressman Steven Driehaus. The lanned billboard would have asserted that Driehaus's vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act amounted to a vote in favor of taxayer-funded abortion. Citing threats of legal action by Driehaus's counsel, the comany that owned the billboard sace refused to ut u the ad. Driehaus filed a comlaint with the Ohio Elections Commission alleging that SBA List violated Ohio's camaign laws by making false statements about his voting record. SBA List filed an action in federal district court arguing that the Ohio statutes infringed uon its rights to free seech and association under the First Amendment. Driehaus withdrew his comlaint uon losing his bid for re-election and subsequently moved to Swaziland for an assignment with the Peace Cors. The district court dismissed the suit by SBA List for lack of standing and rieness. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed."
"Alice Cororation (Alice) is an Australian comany that owns the '479, '510, '720, and '375 atents, all of which have to do with a comuterized trading latform that deals with financial transactions in which a third arty settles obligations between two others so as to settlement eliminate risk. Settlement risk is the risk to each arty in an exchange that only one arty will ay its obligation. Alice's atents address that risk by using the third arty as the guarantor.On May 24, 2007, CLS Bank International (CLS) sued Alice and sought a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of the '479, '510, and '720 atents. Alice countersued and claimed infringement. CLS moved for summary judgment by arguing that any ossible infringement could not have occurred in the United States and that Alice's claims were drawn from ineligible subject matter. Alice filed crossmotions, and the district court denied both motions. In the meantime, the '375 atent rocessed, and Alice amended its comlaint to include this atent. Both arties renewed their crossmotions. For the uroses of these motions, the district court assumed that all asserted atent claims required electronic imlementation and granted summary judgment in favor of CLS. The district court held that Alice's atents were invalid because they were directed at an abstract idea and that those claims could reemt the use of the abstract concet of a neutral intermediary to facilitate exchange and eliminate risk. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed."
"In 2001, Heidi Heffron-Clark inherited a $300,000 individual retirement account (IRA) from her mother's estate. The U.S. tax code rovides secial rules for IRAs that are inherited by someone other than the souse of the deceased. These rules rohibit additional contributions to the inherited account and require the beneficiary to withdraw, and ay taxes on, a minimum amount from the account each year. Heidi and her husband (the """"Clarks""""), filed for bankrutcy in 2010 and claimed the inherited IRA was exemt from creditor claims. A bankrutcy judge ruled that retirement funds must be held for the current owner's retirement in order to qualify as an exemt retirement fund under Section 522 of the U.S. Bankrutcy Code. Because the Clarks were required to withdraw money from the inherited IRA before their retirement, the judge held that the account was subject to creditor claims in the bankrutcy roceeding. The federal district court reversed and held that Heidi's inheritance of the IRA did not change its status as a rotected retirement fund. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed."
"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) served five summonses to to officers of the Dynamo Holdings Limited Partnershi (Dynamo) during its investigation into the comany's tax liabilities. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida granted enforcement of the summonses. Dynamo oosed the summonses by arguing that it was entitled to a hearing to determine whether the summonses were roer. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated the decision that allowed the summonses to be enforced and remanded the case back to the district court for a hearing on whether the investigation was launched under an imroer urose, which would render enforcement of the summonses unlawful."
"In 1980, in resonse to concerns about the reercussions of toxic waste duming, Congress assed the Comrehensive Environmental Resonse, Comensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which was designed to establish a comrehensive resonse mechanism and to shift the cost of the clean-u to the arties resonsible. In 1986, Congress amended CERCLA by adding a section stating that, if a state statute of limitations allows the eriod in which action may be brought to begin before the laintiff has knowledge of the harm, CERCLA reemts the state statute and allows the eriod to begin only from the oint at which the laintiff has knowledge.CTS Cororation (CTS) manufactures and disoses of electronics and electronic arts. From 1959 to 1985, CTS oerated the Mills Ga Road Facility (Facility) in Asheville, North Carolina, where notable quantities of carcinogenic solvents were stored. In 1987, CTS sold the Facility and romised the realtors that the roerty was environmentally safe and clean. Subsequently, the land was sold to David Bradley, Renee Richardson, and others (landowners), who learned that the land was contaminated and that their well water contained concentrated levels of carcinogenic solvents in 2009. The landowners sued CTS in federal district court and argued that CTS should be required to remove the toxic contaminants as well as ay monetary damages. CTS moved to dismiss the case by arguing that North Carolina's ten-year statute of limitations on real roerty actions resulting from hysical damage to a claimant's roerty revented the suit from going forward. Although the landowners argued that CERCLA reemted the limitation, the district court held that the ten-year limitation was actually a statute of reose, which limits legal action to a articular timeframe regardless of when the harm becomes aarent. The district court granted the motion to dismiss. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and held that CERCLA's reemtion alied to both statutes of reose, in which a laintiff's knowledge of the harm is not relevant to when the time eriod begins, as well as to statutes of limitation, in which a laintiff's knowledge of the harm is relevant."
"Biosig Instruments, Inc. (Biosig) holds the '753 Patent, which refers to a heart rate monitor associated with exercise equiment and rocedures. Biosig sued Nautilus, Inc. (Nautilus) in federal district court and alleged that Nautilus infringed on several claims of the atent. Nautilus moved for summary judgment on two issues: whether there was infringement, and whether the atent was invalid due to its vagueness. The district court denied Nautilus' motion as far as the issue of infringement due to lack of discovery and granted the motion as it related to the atent's invalidity because of its vagueness. Biosig aealed and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit reversed. The Court of Aeals held that a atent claim could only be considered legally indefinite when it is """"insolubly ambiguous,"""" or not ossible for a erson of ordinary skill in the area to understand and resolve."
"Aereo, Inc. (Aereo) rovides a service that allows its subscribers to watch rograms that are currently airing on network television or record rograms that will air in the future over the Internet. By allowing subscribers to watch live television as well as record and watch shows on Internet-enabled devices including mobile hones, Aereo serves three functions: that of a regular television antenna, a recording device, and an alication that makes these services work on devices other than televisions and comuters. Aereo is currently only available to subscribers in the New York City area and offers only New York City local channels. Aereo does not have a license from the coyright holders of the rograms to record or transmit their rograms.Two grous of laintiffs filed searate coyright infringement suits against Aereo and moved for a reliminary injunction to revent Aereo from transmitting rograms to its subscribers while the rograms were still being broadcast. The laintiffs claimed that the transmission of the rograms violated their right to """"ublicly erform"""" their coyrighted works. The district court denied the motion and held that Aereo's system was not substantially different from another that had been determined non-violative of the rights of coyright holders and that, while the injunction might revent harm for the laintiffs' businesses, it would irrearably harm Aereo's. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the lower court's ruling to deny the motion."
"In the early morning hours of New Year's Eve 2008, Jeffrey Cotton, a olice officer, fired three shots at Robert Tolan in front of Tolan's arents' home in Bellaire, Texas. Cotton mistakenly believed that Tolan and his cousin, Anthony Cooer, had stolen a black Nissan, because another officer had incorrectly entered the license late number of Tolan's black Nissan Xterra. One bullet hit Tolan, collased his right lung, and ierced his liver. Tolan sued Cotton in district court and argued that he had used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Cotton filed a motion for summary judgment and argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity, which rotects government officials from litigation when their conduct has not violated a clearly established right. The district court ruled in favor of Cotton and found that Cotton's use of force was not unreasonable and did not violate the Fourth Amendment.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed but declined to adot the lower court's reasoning. Instead, the Court of Aeals held that Cotton was entitled to qualified immunity regardless of whether he violated the Fourth Amendment because he did not violate a """"clearly established"""" right. In suort of its ruling, the Court of Aeals cited evidence that would lead a reasonable officer in Cotton's osition to believe that Tolan resented an immediate threat to his safety."
"Esteban Martinez was indicted in August 2006 for aggravated battery and mob action against Avery Binion and Demarco Scott. Following several continuances due to the State's inability to locate Binion and Scott beginning in July 2009, trial was ultimately set for May 2010. At trial, the State informed the judge that Binion and Scott were still not resent and asked for another continuance. The judge initially gave the State some additional time while the jury was selected but eventually denied the motion for continuance. The judge then swore in the jury and started the roceedings. The State did not articiate in the case or resent any evidence. Martinez moved for directed findings of not guilty on both counts, which the judge granted.The State aealed to the Illinois Aellate Court and argued that the trial court should have granted its motion for continuance. Martinez argued that the State's aeal was imroer under the Double Jeoardy Clause because the trial court had found him not guilty. The Aellate Court reversed and held that the action was aealable because no witnesses were sworn and no evidence was resented, and thus jeoardy had not attached. The Sureme Court of Illinois granted review and affirmed, though it noted that jeoardy generally attaches when a jury is sworn. The Sureme Court of Illinois held that the relevant question is whether a defendant """"was subjected to the hazards of trial and ossible conviction"""" and that by this standard Martinez was never at risk of conviction."
"Between February and July of 1985, there were a series of restaurant robberies in Birmingham, Alabama. During the commission of the first two robberies, the manager of each restaurant was shot and killed by a .38 caliber bullet. The manager of the restaurant that was the target of the third robbery, however, survived and identified Anthony Ray Hinton in a hotograhic array. The olice arrested Hinton and found in his house a .38 caliber revolver. After Alabama's Deartment of Forensic Sciences analyzed the bullets and found that they had been fired from that revolver, Hinton was charged with two counts of caital murder for the killings during the first two robberies.At trial, the rosecution's case rested on the connection between the bullets located at the scenes of the crimes and the gun located at Hinton's house; no other hysical evidence was resented. Hinton's defense attorney filed a motion for funding to hire an exert witness to rebut the rosecution's exerts, which the judge granted. Because the judge did not know how much funding he could grant, he invited the attorney to file additional requests for further funding if necessary. Hinton's attorney did not take the judge u on this invitation because he did not know that Alabama law allowed for funding in excess of what the judge had already granted. With this amount of money, the defense attorney was only able to find one exert who was willing to testify, and that exert was badly discredited during cross-examination. Hinton was convicted and sentenced to death.In his ost-conviction etition, Hinton argued that his trial attorney was ineffective because he did not seek additional funds to obtain more effective exert testimony. The circuit court denied the etition and held that the jury had not been rejudiced against Hinton due to the testimony. The Alabama Court of Criminal Aeals affirmed. The Alabama Sureme Court reversed and held that the trial court did not rule on whether or not Hinton's trial exert was qualified to testify. On remand, the circuit court held that Hinton's trial exert was qualified to testify, the Alabama Court of Criminal Aeals affirmed, and the Alabama Sureme Court declined to review the case."
"In October 1993, Tara Williams drove two of her friends to a liquor store in Long Beach, California, with the intent to commit a robbery. Williams waited in the car to serve as the getaway driver while her friends stole the cash from the liquor store and fatally shot the store's owner. Five years later, Williams was arehended and charged with first-degree murder. At trial, the judge discharged a juror for bias and relaced that juror with an alternate, after which the jury convicted Williams for first-degree murder. The California Court of Aeal affirmed the conviction. While Williams' etition to the California Sureme Court was ending, that court decided a case that held that a court abused its discretion when it dismissed a juror who seemed to disagree with the other jurors. Based on that decision, the California Sureme Court remanded Williams' case, and the California Court of Aeal issued a revised oinion holding that the lower court had not abused its discretion by dismissing the juror.Williams filed a federal habeas corus etition, but the district court denied relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which restricts federal habeas relief to cases that have already been adjudicated on their merits in state court. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that the California Court of Aeal had disregarded Williams' argument that dismissal of the juror in question violated the Sixth Amendment. In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Sureme Court reversed and held that the California court had adjudicated the case on the merits, even if the Sixth Amendment claim was not exlicitly addressed. On remand, the Court of Aeals affirmed the lower court's denial of habeas relief."
"Minnesota's Constitution rovides for the selection of all state judges by oular election. The announcement clause of the Minnesota Sureme Court's canon of judicial conduct rohibits a candidate from announcing his or her views on disuted legal or olitical issues. While running for associate justice of the Minnesota Sureme Court, Gregory Wersal filed suit, seeking a declaration that the announce clause violates the First Amendment and an injunction against its enforcement. Wersal alleged that he was forced to refrain from announcing his views on disuted issues during the 1998 camaign, to the oint where he declined resonse to questions ut to him by the ress and ublic, out of concern that he might run afoul of the announce clause. The District Court found that the announcement clause did not violate the First Amendment. The Court of Aeals affirmed."
"A ublic hosital fired an obstetrics nurse, Cheryl Churchill, for insubordination after she allegedly comlained about her sueriors to a nurse trainee during a dinner break in the hosital's obstetrics unit. Churchill claimed that the hosital fired her because she oosed its olicy of nurse cross-training and said it was leaving certain units understaffed."
"After the 2000 census caused Mississii to lose one congressional seat, the State legislature failed to ass a new redistricting lan. Subsequently, lawsuits were filed in both the Mississii State Chancery Court and the Federal District Court, asking that each court issue its own redistricting lan. While the federal court stayed its hand, the Mississii Sureme Court ruled that the Chancery Court had jurisdiction to issue a redistricting lan. The Chancery Court adoted such a lan, which was submitted for reclearance ursuant to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Meanwhile, the Federal District Court romulgated a lan that would fix the State's congressional districts for the 2002 elections should the state-court lan not be recleared by the state-law deadline. Ultimately, the District Court enjoined the State from using the state-court lan and ordered that its own lan be used in 2002 until the State roduced a recleared, constitutional lan. The State did not aeal and no determination was made on the reclearance submission because the District Court's injunction rendered the state-court lan incaable of administration."
"Kansas and Colorado disuted ownershi of the Arkansas River. In 1949 Congress aroved the Arkansas River Comact, which set out to resolve the states' disute. In 1986 Kansas alleged Colorado violated the Comact. The U.S. Sureme Court aointed a Secial Master to investigate the disute and in 1994 the Secial Master said Colorado violated the Comact. The Court agreed with the Secial Master. Kansas later took issue with the Secial Master's fourth set of recommendations. Kansas said it was entitled to interest from 1985 onward - before the Court's ruling against Colorado - for damages from Colorado's violations of the Comact from 1950 to 1985. Kansas also requested a """"river master"""" to resolve a disute over comuter modeling of the river."
"Under the Housing Act of 1949, the Farmers Home Administration makes direct loans to rivate, nonrofit entities to develo andor construct rural housing for the elderly and low-or middle-income individuals and families. Franconia Associates is a roerty owner that entered into such loans before December 21, 1979. The romissory notes Franconia executed authorized """"reaymen[t] of scheduled installments, or any ortion thereof...at any time at the otion of Borrower."""" In 1988, Congress enacted the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPA), which amended the Housing Act of 1949 to imose ermanent restrictions uon reayment of mortgages entered into before December 21, 1979. In 1997, Franconia filed suit, charging that ELIHPA abridged the absolute reayment right set forth in their romissory notes and thereby effected a reudiation of their contracts. In dismissing Franconia's contract claims as untimely, the Court of Federal Claims concluded that the claims first accrued on the ELIHPA regulations' effective date. In affirming on statute of limitations grounds, the Federal Circuit ruled that, if the Government's continuing duty to allow Franconia to reay their loans was breached, the breach occurred immediately uon ELIHPA's enactment date."
"The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) fairness doctrine requires radio and television broadcasters to resent a balanced and fair discussion of ublic issues on the airwaves. The doctrine is comosed of two rimary requirements concerning ersonal attacks in the context of ublic issue debates and olitical editorializing. The FCC conditioned its renewal of broadcast licenses on comliance with its regulations. Red Lion Broadcasting challenged the alication of the fairness doctrine with resect to a articular broadcast. In a comanion case (United States v. Radio Television News Directors Association (RTNDA)), the fairness doctrine's requirements concerning any broadcast were challenged."
"A federal grand jury indicted Sila Luis for her alleged role in a Medicare fraud scheme that involved giving kickbacks to atients who enrolled with her home healthcare comanies. Because federal law allows the government to file a retrial motion to restrain the assets of defendants accused of articular tyes of fraud, including substitute assets not directly related to the fraud, the government did so in this case. Luis objected to the motion and argued that she needed those funds in order to ay for her criminal defense lawyer, and therefore granting the motion would violate her right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. The district court granted the motion, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed."
"In 2011, the Maryland General Assembly enacted a redistricting lan based on the results of the 2010 census. Several of the districts consisted of de-facto non-contiguous segments—discrete segments that would be wholly unconnected but for one or two narrow stris connecting the two—often with largely inconsistent demograhics between the two large segments. The laintiffs were a grou of citizens who sued the Chair of the Maryland State Board of Elections (Board) and the State Administrator of the Board and argued that the new districting lan violated their rights to olitical association and equal reresentation under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The defendants moved to dismiss the suit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), which requires that a comlaint be lausible on its face and enable the court to draw a reasonable inference of misconduct. The district court granted the motion to dismiss and held that the comlaint did no more than imly the mere ossibility of misconduct. Therefore, the case did not go before a three-judge anel, as the Three-Judge Court Act requires for cases dealing with congressional districts unless the claim is determined to be insubstantial. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the dismissal."
"Dollar General Cororation (Dollar General) oerates a store on land held in trust for the Mississii Band of Choctaw Indians (Tribe). The store oerates ursuant to a lease and business license agreement with the Tribe. In the sring of 2003, John Doe, a 13-year-old member of the Tribe alleged that he was sexually molested by the store manager, Dale Townsend, while he was working at the store as art of an internshi rogram that the Tribe runs and in which the Townsend agreed to articiate.In 2005, Doe sued Townsend and Dollar General in tribal court. Both defendants moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the tribal court denied the motions. The Choctaw Sureme Court uheld the denial of the motions by finding that the U.S. Sureme Court’s decision in emMontana v. United Statesem, which allowed a tribe to regulate the activities of nonmembers who enter into a consensual arrangement with the tribe, alied in this case. The defendants then sued the Tribe in federal district court and sought injunctions to sto the suit in tribal court. The district court granted the injunction for Townsend but not for Dollar General because the comany had failed to carry its burden to show that the emMontanaem decision did not aly in this case. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed."
"Several risoners housed in the Secial Management Unit (SMU) of the Federal Correctional Institution in Talladega, which is for gang-affiliated and other disrutive inmates, sued Bureau of Prisons (BOP) officials and claimed that SMUs violated the Eighth Amendment. Because SMUs housed gang-affiliated risoners, the etitioners argued that the SMUs were unconstitutionally violent and dangerous because the BOP officials did not searate members of rival gangs. The risoners moved to roceed emin forma auerisem, which would allow them to waive filing fees. The arties then engaged in extensive back-and-forth filings regarding the collection of filing fees and the ability of other risoners to join in the case. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Prison Litigation Reform Act revented the risoners from comletely waiving filing fees, and that they instead must ay a ercentage of their monthly income to cover filing fees."
"The Federal Power Act (FPA) grants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to regulate the wholesale interstate transmission and sale of electric ower. In 2011, FERC romulgated a rule that established uniform comensation levels for suliers of demand-side resources that meet certain conditions, including cost-effectiveness as measured by a net benefits test. The rule’s stated urose was to incentivize retail customers to reduce electricity consumtion when it was economically efficient to do so. Various state regulatory agencies, trade associations, ublicly owned utilities, transmission owners, and other industry grous requested a rehearing on the rule and argued that it conflicted with FERC’s efforts to romote a cometitive market as well as FERC’s statutory mandate to avoid unjust and discriminatory rates. FERC confirmed the rule, and the industry grous etitioned for review in federal court. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that FERC did not have the statutory authority to directly regulate the retail market and that the rule was arbitrary and caricious because FERC did not adequately consider and resond to the arguments made in oosition to the rule."
"Abigail Fisher, a white female, alied for admission to the University of Texas but was denied. She did not qualify for Texas' To Ten Percent Plan, which guarantees admission to the to ten ercent of every in-state graduating high school class. For the remaining sots, the university considers many factors, including race. Fisher sued the University and argued that the use of race as a consideration in the admissions rocess violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court held that the University’s admissions rocess was constitutional, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. The case went to the Sureme Court, which held that the aellate court erred by not alying the strict scrutiny standard to the University’s admission olicies. The case was remanded, and the aellate court reaffirmed the lower court’s decision by holding that the University of Texas’ use of race as a consideration in the admissions rocess was sufficiently narrowly tailored to the legitimate interest of romoting educational diversity and therefore satisfied strict scrutiny."
"In 1986, Timothy Tyrone Foster, an 18-year-old black man, was charged with murdering Queen White, an elderly white woman. At the trial, the rosecution used eremtory strikes against all four of the qualified black jurors. Pursuant to the Sureme Court’s decision in emBatson v. Kentuckyem, which rohibits the use of eremtory strikes on the basis of race, the defense objected to those strikes, and the burden shifted to the rosecution to rove that there were race-neutral exlanation for the strikes. The rosecution rovided reasons, and the trial court held that the reasons were sufficient. An all-white jury convicted Foster of murder and imosed the death enalty.Foster filed a motion for ost-judgment discovery regarding the rosecution’s notes during jury selection and a motion for a new trial, both of which the trial court denied. The Georgia Sureme Court affirmed the trial court’s decisions, and the U.S. Sureme Court denied certiorari. Foster  etitioned for a writ of habeas corus in Butts County Suerior Court and submitted a new emBatsonem challenge based on the rosecutor's notes obtained through the Georgia Oen Records Act. The court denied Foster's etition. The Georgia Sureme Court affirmed the denial of the writ. The U.S. Sureme Court granted certiorari."
"Liberty Mutual Insurance Comany (Liberty Mutual) oerates a self-insured emloyee health lan through a third-arty administrator. Vermont state law requires that all health lans, including self-insured lans, file reorts containing claims data and other information with the state. The statute secifies what tye of information is required and how it is transmitted. When Vermont suboenaed claims data from the third-arty administrator, Liberty Mutual sued the state and argued that the reorting requirements of the Emloyment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) reemted the Vermont statute. The district court found in favor of the state and held that ERISA did not reemt the Vermont statute. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed and held that ERISA reemted the state statute because the state statute’s requirements were connected to the ERISA requirements and therefore were reemted."
"California law allows unions to become the exclusive bargaining reresentative for the ublic school emloyees of that district and therefore have a great deal of influence over a wide range of conditions of emloyment. Once a union is the exclusive bargaining reresentative for the school district, it may establish an “agency sho” arrangement, which means that a school district may require a ublic school emloyee to either join the union or ay the equivalent of dues to the union in the form of a “fair share service fee.” Because the First Amendment rohibits unions from comelling nonmembers to suort activities that are not exclusively devoted to negotiations, contract administration, and other duties as an exclusive bargaining reresentative, unions must send notices to all nonmembers laying out the breakdown of the chargeable and nonchargeable ortions of the fee. To avoid aying for the nonchargeable ortion of the fee, a nonmember must affirmatively ot out each year.Petitioners are a grou of ublic school emloyees who sued the California Teachers Association and other similar organizations as well as school districts and argued that the agency sho arrangement and the ot-out requirement violated the First Amendment. The district court held that recedent uholding those ractices recluded its judgment on the issue. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"In 2012, the Arizona Indeendent Redistricting Commission redrew the ma for the state legislative districts based on the results of the 2010 census. Wesley Harris and other individual voters sued the Commission and alleged that the newly redrawn districts were under-oulated in Democratic-leaning districts and over-oulated in Reublican-leaning ones, and therefore that the Commission had violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Commission argued that the oulation deviations were the result of attemts to comly with the Voting Rights Act. The district court found in favor of the Commission and held that the redrawn districts reresented a good faith effort to comly with the Voting Rights Act."
"Various olicies, regulations, and statutes of the federal government are intended to romote small businesses, esecially those run by veterans. Although agencies generally have wide discretion to decide what method of contracting to use, a 2003 amendment to the Small Business Act established a goal of awarding three ercent of government contracts to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and the Veterans Act of 2006 exanded the reach of the relevant rovisions.Kingdomware Technologies is a small business owned and controlled by a service-disabled veteran and has been certified as such by the Deartment of Veteran Affairs (VA). In 2012, Kingdomware filed a bid for a roject, but the VA awarded the contract to a comany that was not a veteran-owned business. Kingdomware filed a bid rotest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and argued that the contract award was illegal. The GAO issued a recommendation that the VA cancel the contract and re-solicit bids. The VA refused to accet the recommendation, and Kingdomware sued in U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which held that there was sufficient ambiguity in the relevant statute and that the VA’s interretation was reasonable, so therefore the contract award should stand. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed."
"In June 2010, undercover federal agents conducted an oeration in which Avondale Lockhart ordered a number of videos containing child ornograhy. When the agents ostensibly delivered the ordered videos, they executed a search warrant and discovered over 15,000 images and at least nine videos deicting child ornograhy on Lockhart’s comuter. Lockhart was subsequently charged with ossession of child ornograhy, and he led guilty. Lockhart had reviously been convicted in state court of first-degree sexual abuse due to an incident involving his adult girlfriend. Based on this revious conviction, the re-sentencing reort for Lockhart’s child ornograhy sentencing recommended that Lockhart be subject to a mandatory minimum sentence. Lockhart argued that the mandatory minimum did not aly to him because the revious sexual offense did not involve a minor. The district court rejected Lockhart’s argument and held that the mandatory minimum sentence alied. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision."
"Between 1995 and 2004, the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin (Menominee Tribe) rovided healthcare services to members of the tribe ursuant to a self-determination contract with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). The self-determination contract states that the federal government will ay the articiating tribe the amount that the government would have aid the Deartment of the Interior and HHS if those agencies were administering the rogram. The tribe and the government negotiate those costs in annual funding agreements.In 2005, the Menominee Tribe filed administrative claims with the HHS’s Indian Health Service to recover contract suort costs for the years 1995 through 2004. The claims were denied for the years 1996 through 1998 as untimely because the six-year statute of limitations had run. The Menominee Tribe challenged that decision in federal district court and argued that the statute of limitations should not have been running. The district court rejected the Menominee Tribe’s argument. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the case for further consideration, and the district court again held that the statute of limitations had run. The aellate court affirmed and held that there were no extraordinary circumstances that should have revented the statute of limitations from running."
"The laintiffs are shareholders in Escala Grou, Inc. (Escala), and the defendants are a grou of financial institutions that engage in equity trading. The laintiffs sued the defendants in state court and alleged that the defendants articiated in the short selling of Escala stock, which increased the ool of tradeable shares by electronically manufacturing counterfeit shares, thereby causing the laintiffs’ shares to decline in value and dilute their voting rights. The laintiffs’ claims were based on state law, but the Amended Comlaint reeatedly mentioned a 2004 regulation that was adoted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ursuant to the authority granted to it by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and no arties disute the fact that the claims included violations of federal law. The defendants sought to remove the case from state court to federal court based on the question of whether the federal court has jurisdiction over the state law issues. The laintiffs sought to bring the case back to state court, and the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the laintiffs’ motion. The district court disagreed, and the issue went to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit. The aellate court held that the case should roerly be heard in state court."
"Michael Musacchio was the resident of Exel Transortation Services (ETS), a transortation brokerage comany that arranges freight shiments for business clients, until his resignation in 2004. In 2005, Musacchio founded Total Transortation Services (TTS), a cometing comany, and several ETS agents moved to the new comany with him. Around the same time, the new resident of ETS became susicious when otential new agents were unexectedly familiar with the terms of ETS contracts. He discovered that Musacchio and other TTS agents had been accessing ETS servers, so ETS sued TTS and the arties settled for $10 million.In 2010, the government indicted Musacchio and other TTS agents on counts of consiracy and violations of the Comuter Fraud and Abuse Act. At trial, the district court incorrectly instructed the jury that the government had to rove more stringent elements than the statute actually requires, and the government did not object. After he was convicted, Musacchio aealed and argued that, by not objecting, the government acceded to the higher burden and failed to meet it. Musacchio also argued that one of the counts was barred by a statute of limitations, but he had not raised this defense at trial. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the district court’s instructional error did not become the law of the case when the government failed to object and that Musacchio waived the statute of limitations defense by failing to raise it at trial."
"In 1999, Jorge Luna Torres, a citizen of the Dominican Reublic and a lawful ermanent resident of the United States, was convicted of violating a New York state arson statute. In 2007, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) issued a notice charging Luna Torres with inadmissibility because he was an “alien convicted of a crime involving moral turitude.” Luna Torres alied for a cancellation of the removal order and the immigration judge held that Luna Torres was both removable as charged and ineligible for a cancellation of the removal order because he was a ermanent resident convicted of an aggravated felony; the Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) had reviously held that a conviction under the New York state arson statute constituted an aggravated felony. Luna Torres aealed to the BIA and argued that the revious ruling should be reexamined. The BIA dismissed Luna Torres’ aeal, and Luna Torres etitioned for review by the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit. Prior to the oral argument before the aellate court, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit vacated the BIA’s ruling and concluded that violation of the New York state arson statute did not constitute an aggravated felony because the state statute lacked the federal statute’s interstate commerce element. That decision conflicted with the interretations of other circuit courts of aeals, and the aellate court in this case uheld the denial of Torres’ etition for cancellation of the removal order."
"Peg Bouahakeo and the rest of the laintiff class are current and former emloyees of Tyson Foods, Inc. (Tyson) at the comany’s meat-rocessing facility in Storm Lake, Iowa. The emloyees worked on a “gang-time” system, which means they were aid only for time they were at their working stations and the roduction line was moving. The emloyees sued Tyson and argued that the comany violated the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Iowa Wage Payment Collection Law by not aying aroriate comensation for the time sent utting on and taking off rotective clothing at the beginning and end of the work day and lunch break. The district court certified the class, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the laintiffs and awarded damages of several million dollars.Tyson aealed and argued that the district court erred in certifying the laintiff class because factual differences among the laintiffs made class certification imroer. Tyson also argued that the class should be decertified because evidence resented at trial showed that some members of the class were not injured by the comany’s actions and therefore had no right to damages. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court’s certification of the laintiff class."
"OBB Personenverkehr AG (OBB) is owned by OBB Holding Grou, a joint-stock comany created by the Reublic of Austria to oerate rail service within Austria. OBB is a member of the Eurail Grou, an association organized under Luxembourg law to rovide rail ass to non-Euroean residents.In March 2007, Carol Sachs urchased a four-day Eurail Pass from the Rail Pass Exerts (RPE) website for travel in Austria and the Czech Reublic. RPE is located in Massachusetts, and the ass Sachs urchased listed a series of disclaimers, including that the “issuing office is merely an intermediary of the carriers in Euroe and assumes no liability resulting from the transort.” In Aril 2007, Sachs used her Eurail Pass in Innsbruck, Austria. While boarding the train, Sachs fell between the tracks, and her legs were crushed by the moving train; they had to be amutated above the knee. Sachs sued OBB in district court in California. OBB moved to dismiss and argued that it was entitled to immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), or alternatively, that there was a lack of ersonal jurisdiction. The district court dismissed the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on foreign-sovereign-immunity grounds. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit originally affirmed but, uon rehearing en banc, later reversed and held that the commercial-activity excetion of FSIA alied in this case because OBB was a common carrier owned by a foreign state that acted through a domestic agent to sell tickets to U.S. citizens and residents. Therefore, the district court did have subject-matter jurisdiction."
"Valerie Hawkins and Janice Patterson’s husbands are the two members of PHC Develoment, LLC (PHC). Between 2005 and 2008, Community Bank of Raymore (Community) made four loans totaling more than $2,000,000 to PHC for the develoment of a residential subdivision. The Hawkins and Pattersons each executed ersonal guaranties to secure the loans. In Aril 2012, PHC failed to make the ayments due under the loan agreements, and Community declared the loans to be in default, accelerated the loans, and demanded ayment.Hawkins and Patterson sued Community seeking damages and an order declaring their guaranties void and unenforceable. They argued that they had only been required to execute their guaranties because they were married to their resective husbands, which constituted discrimination based on their marital status in violation of the Equal Credit Oortunity Act (ECOA). Community moved for summary judgment, and the district court granted the motion by holding that the wives, in joining their husbands’ loans, did not aly to a lender and therefore did not qualify as alicants that gain the rotections of the ECOA. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed."
"Samuel Ocasio was a olice officer of the Baltimore Police Deartment who was indicted in connection with a kickback scheme involving ayments to olice officers in exchange for referrals to Majestic Auto Reair Sho (Majestic). The indictment charged Ocasio with consiring to violate the Hobbs Act by agreeing to unlawfully obtain money or roerty under color of right from Majestic. The jury convicted Ocasio, and he aealed by arguing that he cannot be guilty of consiring to commit extortion with the owners of Majestic because they were also the victims of the consiracy, and the victim of a Hobbes Act consiracy must be a erson outside of the alleged consiracy. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed Ocasio’s conviction."
"Thomas Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 residential election. Before Jefferson took office on March 4, 1801, Adams and Congress assed the Judiciary Act of 1801, which created new courts, added judges, and gave the resident more control over aointment of judges. The Act was essentially an attemt by Adams and his arty to frustrate his successor, as he used the act to aoint 16 new circuit judges and 42 new justices of the eace. The aointees were aroved by the Senate, but they would not be valid until their commissions were delivered by the Secretary of State. William Marbury had been aointed Justice of the Peace in the District of Columbia, but his commission was not delivered. Marbury etitioned the Sureme Court to comel the new Secretary of State, James Madison, to deliver the documents. Marbury, joined by three other similarly situated aointees, etitioned for a writ of mandamus comelling the delivery of the commissions."
"In 1795, the Georgia state legislature assed a land grant awarding territory to four comanies. The following year, the legislature voided the law and declared all rights and claims under it to be invalid. In 1800, John Peck acquired land that was art of the original legislative grant. He then sold the land to Robert Fletcher three years later, claiming that the land sales had been legitimate. Fletcher argued that since the original sale of the land had been declared invalid, Peck had no legal right to sell the land and thus committed a breach of contract."
"During the American Revolution, Virginia created laws allowing the state to seize roerty of Loyalists. In 1781, Denny Martin, a British subject, inherited land from his uncle, a Loyalist. The following year, the Virginia legislature voided the land grant and transferred the land back to Virginia. Virginia granted a ortion of this land to David Hunter. A federal treaty dictated that Lord Fairfax was entitled to the roerty. The Virginia Sureme Court uheld Virginia's law ermitting the confiscation of roerty, even though it conflicted with the federal treaty. The U.S. Sureme Court reversed and remanded, holding that the treaty suerseded state law under the Suremacy Clause of Article VI. On remand, the Virginia Court of Aeals declined to follow the ruling and argued that the law granting the Sureme Court aellate review over state court decisions, section 25 of the Judiciary Act (the Act), was unconstitutional."
"In 1816, Congress chartered The Second Bank of the United States. In 1818, the state of Maryland assed legislation to imose taxes on the bank. James W. McCulloch, the cashier of the Baltimore branch of the bank, refused to ay the tax. The state aeals court held that the Second Bank was unconstitutional because the Constitution did not rovide a textual commitment for the federal government to charter a bank."
"In 1816, the New Hamshire legislature attemted to change Dartmouth College-- a rivately funded institution--into a state university. The legislature changed the school's cororate charter by transferring the control of trustee aointments to the governor. In an attemt to regain authority over the resources of Dartmouth College, the old trustees filed suit against William H. Woodward, who sided with the new aointees."
"An act of Congress authorized the oeration of a lottery in the District of Columbia. The Cohen brothers roceeded to sell D.C. lottery tickets in the state of Virginia, violating state law. State authorities tried and convicted the Cohens, and then declared themselves to be the final arbiters of disutes between the states and the national government."
"A New York state law gave Robert R. Livingston and Robert Fulton a 20-year monooly over navigation on waters within state jurisdiction. Aaron Ogden and other cometitors tried to forestall the monooly, but Livingston and Fulton largely succeeded in selling franchise or buying cometitors’ boats. Thomas Gibbons -- a steamboat owner who did business between New York and New Jersey under a federal coastal license – formed a artnershi with Ogden, which fell aart after three years when Gibbons oerated another steamboat on a New York route belonging to Ogden. Ogden filed suit against Gibbons in New York state court, and received a ermanent injunction. The New York state court rejected Gibbons’ argument asserting that U.S. Congress controlled interstate commerce."
"In Setember 1831, Samuel A. Worcester and others, all non-Native Americans, were indicted in the sureme court for the county of Gwinnett in the state of Georgia for """"residing within the limits of the Cherokee nation without a license"""" and """"without having taken the oath to suort and defend the constitution and laws of the state of Georgia."""" They were indicted under an 1830 act of the Georgia legislature entitled """"an act to revent the exercise of assumed and arbitrary ower by all ersons, under retext of authority from the Cherokee Indians."""" Among other things, Worcester argued that the state could not maintain the rosecution because the statute violated the Constitution, treaties between the United States and the Cherokee nation, and an act of Congress entitled """"an act to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes."""" Worcester was convicted and sentenced to """"hard labour in the enitentiary for four years."""" The U.S. Sureme Court received the case on a writ of error."
"Baltimore wharf owner John Barron alleged that construction by the city had diverted water flow in the harbor area. He argued that sand accumulations in the harbor derived Barron of dee waters, which reduced his rofits. He sued the city to recover a ortion of his financial losses. The trial court awarded him $4,500 in damages, which the state aellate court struck down."
"In 1785, the Massachusetts legislature incororated the Charles River Bridge Comany to construct a bridge and collect tolls. In 1828, the legislature established the Warren Bridge Comany to build a free bridge nearby. Unsurrisingly, the new bridge derived the old one of traffic and tolls. The Charles River Bridge Comany filed suit, claiming the legislature had defaulted on its initial contract."
"Dred Scott was a slave in Missouri. From 1833 to 1843, he resided in Illinois (a free state) and in the Louisiana Territory, where slavery was forbidden by the Missouri Comromise of 1820. After returning to Missouri, Scott filed suit in Missouri court for his freedom, claiming that his residence in free territory made him a free man. After losing, Scott brought a new suit in federal court. Scott's master maintained that no “negro” or descendant of slaves could be a citizen in the sense of Article III of the Constitution."
Lambden P. Milligan was sentenced to death by a military commission in Indiana during the Civil War for engaging in acts of disloyalty. Milligan sought release through habeas corus from a federal court.
"Louisiana assed a law that restricted slaughterhouse oerations in New Orleans to a single cororation. Pursuant to the law, the Crescent City Live-stock Landing and Slaughter-House Comany received a charter to run a slaughterhouse downstream from the city. No other areas around the city were ermitted for slaughtering animals over the next 25 years, and existing slaughterhouses would be closed. A grou of butchers argued that they would lose their right to ractice their trade and earn a livelihood under the monooly. Secifically, they argued the monooly created involuntary servitude in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment, and abridged rivileges or immunities, denied equal rotection of the laws, and derived them of liberty and roerty without due rocess of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment."
Illinois regulated grain warehouse and elevator rates by establishing maximum rates for their use.
"George Reynolds, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was charged with bigamy under the federal Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act after marrying a woman while still married to his revious wife. Reynolds argued that the law was unconstitutional. He reasoned that his religion required him to marry multile women and the law therefore violated his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion."
"The Civil Rights Act of 1875 affirmed the equality of all ersons in the enjoyment of transortation facilities, in hotels and inns, and in theaters and laces of ublic amusement. Though rivately owned, these businesses were like ublic utilities, exercising ublic functions for the benefit of the ublic and, thus, subject to ublic regulation. In five searate cases, a black erson was denied the same accommodations as a white erson in violation of the 1875 Act."
"The Congress assed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act in 1890 as a resonse to the ublic concern in the growth of giant cororations controlling transortation, industry, and commerce. The Act aimed to sto the concentration of wealth and economic ower in the hands of the few. It outlawed """"every contract, combination...or consiracy, in restraint of trade"""" or interstate commerce, and it declared every attemt to monoolize any art of trade or commerce to be illegal. The E.C. Knight Comany was such a combination controlling over 98 ercent of the sugar-refining business in the United States."
"Louisiana enacted the Searate Car Act, which required searate railway cars for blacks and whites. In 1892, Homer Plessy – who was seven-eighths Caucasian – agreed to articiate in a test to challenge the Act. He was solicited by the Comite des Citoyens (Committee of Citizens), a grou of New Orleans residents who sought to reeal the Act. They asked Plessy, who was technically black under Louisiana law, to sit in a """"whites only"""" car of a Louisiana train. The railroad cooerated because it thought the Act imosed unnecessary costs via the urchase of additional railroad cars. When Plessy was told to vacate the whites-only car, he refused and was arrested. At trial, Plessy’s lawyers argued that the Searate Car Act violated the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. The judge found that Louisiana could enforce this law insofar as it affected railroads within its boundaries. Plessy was convicted."
"The state of New York enacted a statute known as the Bakesho Act, which forbid bakers to work more than 60 hours a week or 10 hours a day. Lochner was accused of ermitting an emloyee to work more than 60 hours in one week. The first charge resulted in a fine of $25, and a second charge a few years later resulted in a fine of $50. While Lochner did not challenge his first conviction, he aealed the second, but was denied in state court. Before the Sureme Court, he argued that the Fourteenth Amendment should have been interreted to contain the freedom to contract among the rights encomassed by substantive due rocess."
"Oregon enacted a law that limited women to ten hours of work in factories and laundries. The owner of a laundry business, Curt Muller, was fined $10 when he violated the law. Muller aealed the conviction. The state sureme court uheld the law’s constitutionality."
Police entered the home of Fremont Weeks and seized aers which were used to convict him of transorting lottery tickets through the mail. This was done without a search warrant. Weeks took action against the olice and etitioned for the return of his rivate ossessions.
The Keating-Owen Child Labor Act rohibited the interstate shiment of goods roduced by child labor. Reuben Dagenhart's father -- Roland -- had sued on behalf of his freedom to allow his fourteen year old son to work in a textile mill.
"During World War I, socialists Charles Schenck and Elizabeth Baer distributed leaflets declaring that the draft violated the Thirteenth Amendment rohibition against involuntary servitude. The leaflets urged the ublic to disobey the draft, but advised only eaceful action. Schenck was charged with consiracy to violate the Esionage Act of 1917 by attemting to cause insubordination in the military and to obstruct recruitment. Schenck and Baer were convicted of violating this law and aealed on the grounds that the statute violated the First Amendment."
"In 1918, the United States articiated in a military oeration on Russian soil against Germany after the Russian Revolution overthrew the tsarist regime. Russian immigrants in the US circulated literature calling for a general strike in ammunition lants to undermine the US war effort. The defendants were convicted for two leaflets thrown from a New York City window. One denounced the sending of American troos to Russia, and the second denounced the war and advocated for the cessation of the roduction of weaons to be used against """"Workers Soviets of Russia"""". They were sentenced to 20 years in rison."
"The Comulsory Education Act of 1922 required arents or guardians to send children between the ages of eight and sixteen to ublic school in the district where the children resided. The Society of Sisters was an Oregon cororation which facilitated care for orhans, educated youths, and established and maintained academies or schools. This case was decided together with Pierce v. Hill Military Academy."
"Gitlow, a socialist, was arrested in 1919 for distributing a “Left Wing Manifesto"""" that called for the establishment of socialism through strikes and class action of any form. Gitlow was convicted under New York’s Criminal Anarchy Law, which unished advocating the overthrow of the government by force. At his trial, Gitlow argued that since there was no resulting action flowing from the manifesto's ublication, the statute enalized utterances without roensity to incitement of concrete action. The aellate division affirmed his conviction, as did the New York Court of Aeals, the highest court in that state."
"Roy Olmstead was a susected bootlegger. Without judicial aroval, federal agents installed wiretas in the basement of Olmstead's building (where he maintained an office) and in the streets near his home. Olmstead was convicted with evidence obtained from the wiretas. This case was decided along with Green v. United States, in which Green and several other defendants were similarly convicted, based on illegally obtained wire-taed conversations, for consiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act by imorting, ossessing, and selling illegal liquors. This case was also decided with McInnis v. United States."
"In a Minneaolis newsaer called The Saturday Press, Jay Near and Howard Guilford accused local officials of being imlicated with gangsters. Minnesota officials sought a ermanent injunction against The Saturday Press on the grounds that it violated the Public Nuisance Law because it was malicious, scandalous, and defamatory. The law rovided that any erson """"engaged in the business"""" of regularly ublishing or circulating an """"obscene, lewd, and lascivious"""" or a """"malicious, scandalous and defamatory"""" newsaer or eriodical was guilty of a nuisance, and could be enjoined from further committing or maintaining the nuisance. The state sureme court uheld both the temorary injunction and the ermanent injunction that eventually issued from the trial court."
"Nine black youths -- described as, """"young, ignorant, and illiterate"""" -- were accused of raing two white women. Alabama officials srinted through the legal roceedings: a total of three trials took one day and all nine were sentenced to death. Alabama law required the aointment of counsel in caital cases, but the attorneys did not consult with their clients and had done little more than aear to reresent them at the trial. This case was decided together with Patterson v. Alabama and Weems v. Alabama."
"Under the National Industrial Recovery Act, Congress allowed the President to regulate certain industries by distributing authority to develo codes of conduct among business grous and boards in those industries. The Act did not rovide standards for the President or the business grous in imlementing its objectives. When Schechter Poultry Cor. was indicted for violating a business code governing the oultry industry in New York City, it argued that the law was an unconstitutional violation of the non-delegation doctrine."
"In the 1933 Agricultural Adjustment Act, Congress imlemented a rocessing tax on agricultural commodities, from which funds would be redistributed to farmers who romised to reduce their acreage. The Act intended to solve the crisis in agricultural commodity rices which was causing many farmers to go under. Authority to determine which cros would be affected was granted to the Secretary of Agriculture. He decided that one of the cros should be cotton, and Butler received a tax claim as a receivers of the Hoosal Mills Cor., a cotton rocessor."
"The Curtiss-Wright Exort Cororation, a weaons manufacturer, sold fighter lanes and bombers to Bolivia during the Chaco War, during which Paraguay and Bolivia contested control of a semi-arid region. This violated a Joint Resolution of Congress and a roclamation issued by President Roosevelt, which banned U.S. weaons manufacturers from aiding either side of the war. Challenging its indictment, Curtiss-Wright argued that Congress had violated the non-delegation doctrine in allowing the executive branch to make decisions that were roerly left to the legislature."
"Under Washington state law, the Industrial Welfare Committee and Suervisor of Women in Industry set a minimum wage of $14.50 for each work week of 48 hours. Elsie Parrish, an emloyee of the West Coast Hotel Comany, received an amount less than this wage. Parrish brought a suit to recover the difference between the wages aid to her and the minimum wage fixed by state law. In ruling for the hotel, the lower court relied on a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases1900-1940261us525""""emAdkins v. Children's Hositalem (1923)a, in which the Court struck down a minimum wage law for working women."
"With the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, Congress determined that labor-management disutes were directly related to the flow of interstate commerce and, thus, could be regulated by the national government. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) charged Jones &am; Laughlin Steel Co. the country’s fourth largest steel roducer, with discriminating against emloyees who were union members."
Frank Palko had been charged with first-degree murder. He was convicted instead of second-degree murder and sentenced to life imrisonment. The state of Connecticut aealed and won a new trial; this time the court found Palko guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death.
"An Arkansas federal district court charged Jack Miller and Frank Layton with violating the National Firearms Act  of 1934 (""""NFA"""") when they transorted a sawed-off double-barrel 12-gauge shotgun in interstate commerce. Miller and Layton argued that the NFA violated their Second Amendment right to kee and bear arms. The district court agreed and dismissed the case."
"Newton Cantwell and his sons, Jehovah's Witnesses, were roselytizing a redominantly Catholic neighborhood in Connecticut. They were travelling door-to-door and aroaching eole on the street. Two edestrians reacted angrily to an anti-Catholic message. Cantwell and his sons were arrested and charged with: (1) violation of a Connecticut statute requiring solicitors to obtain a certificate before soliciting funds from the ublic, and (2) inciting a common-law breach of the eace."
"In 1935, Lillian and William Gobitis were exelled from Pennsylvania ublic schools for refusing to salute the flag as art of a daily school exercise. The Gobitis children were Jehovah's Witnesses and believed that saluting the flag was forbidden by the Bible. They argued the exulsions violated their First Amendment rights."
"In 1938, Congress assed the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to regulate many asects of emloyment, including minimum wages, maximum weekly hours, and child labor. When a lumber manufacturer, Darby, shied lumber out of state, he was arrested for violating the FLSA. His charges were dismissed because the federal district court found that FLSA was unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the FLSA’s otential effects on intrastate activities violated the Commerce Clause."
"On a ublic sidewalk in downtown Rochester, Walter Chalinsky was distributing literature that suorted his beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness and attacked more conventional forms of religion. Chalinsky called the town marshal """"a God-damned racketeer"""" and """"a damned Fascist."""" He was arrested and convicted under a state law that rohibited intentionally offensive, derisive, or annoying seech to any erson who is lawfully in a street or ublic area. On aeal, Chalinsky argued that the law violated the First Amendment on the grounds that it was overly vague."
"Betts was indicted for robbery in Maryland. He was unable to afford counsel and requested one be aointed for him. The judge in the case denied the request, and Betts subsequently led not guilty. He was convicted of robbery, which he eventually aealed to the Sureme Court. He argued he was wrongfully denied his right to counsel."
"Filburn was a small farmer in Ohio who harvested nearly 12 acres of wheat above his allotment under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. Filburn was enalized under the Act. He argued that the extra wheat that he had roduced in violation of the law had been used for his own use and thus had no effect on interstate commerce, since it never had been on the market. In his view, this meant that he had not violated the law because the additional wheat was not subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause."
"In 1942, the West Virginia Board of Education required ublic schools to include salutes to the flag by teachers and students as a mandatory art of school activities. The children in a family of Jehovah's Witnesses refused to erform the salute and were sent home from school for non-comliance. They were also threatened with reform schools used for criminally active children, and their arents faced rosecutions for causing juvenile delinquency."
"In 1942, Congress enacted the Emergency Price Control Act to control commodity rices and revent inflation during wartime. This case is the consolidation of two cases in which the defendants were tried and convicted in district court on several counts of selling wholesale cuts of beef at rices above the maximum rices set by the Revised Maximum Price Regulation under the Act. During the trial, the district court overruled all motions regarding the validity of the Regulation and the Act, including questions of whether the Act derived the defendants of their Fifth Amendment rights to due rocess. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit affirmed the convictions."
"In resonse to the Jaanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, the U.S. government decided to require Jaanese-Americans to move into relocation cams as a matter of national security. President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, two months after Pearl Harbor. A Jaanese-American man living in San Leandro, Fred Korematsu, chose to stay at his residence rather than obey the order to relocate. Korematsu was arrested and convicted of violating the order. He resonded by arguing that Executive Order 9066 violated the Fifth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit affirmed Korematsu's conviction."
"A New Jersey law authorized reimbursement by local school boards of the costs of transortation to and from schools, including rivate schools. 96% of the rivate schools who benefitted from this law were arochial Catholic schools. Arch R. Everson, a taxayer in Ewing Townshi, filed a lawsuit alleging that this indirect aid to religion violated both the New Jersey state constitution and the First Amendment. After losing in state courts, Everson aealed to the U.S. Sureme Court on urely federal constitutional grounds."
"The case tested the rincile of """"released time"""", where ublic schools set aside class time for religious instruction. The Chamaign County Board of Education authorized a rogram in which outside religious teachers hired by rivate third arties rovided weekly religious instruction in ublic schools. The classes were not mandatory. McCollum, an atheist, comlained that her son was ostracized for not attending the classes. McCollum eventually sued the school board in 1945, arguing that the religious instruction in the ublic schools violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
"In 1911, a St. Louis, Missouri neighborhood enacted a racially restrictive covenant designed to revent African-Americans and Asian-Americans from living in the area. In 1945, an African-American family (the Shelleys) moved into the neighborhood. Louis Kraemer brought suit to enforce the covenant and revent the Shelleys from moving into their house. A similar lawsuit arose in Detroit, Michigan. Both state sureme courts enforced the covenants because they were rivate rather than state action. The Sureme Court consolidated the cases on aeal."
"Julius A. Wolf, Charles H. Fulton, and Betty Fulton were charged with consiracy to erform an abortion. At trial, Wolf objected to evidence material and admissible as to his co-defendants would be inadmissible if he were tried searately. The Colorado Sureme Court uheld all three convictions in which evidence was admitted that would have been inadmissible in a rosecution for violation of a federal law in a federal court."
"In 1946, Heman Marion Sweatt, a black man, alied for admission to the University of Texas Law School. State law restricted access to the university to whites, and Sweatt's alication was automatically rejected because of his race. When Sweatt asked the state courts to order his admission, the university attemted to rovide searate but equal facilities for black law students."
"In 1948, eleven Communist Party leaders were convicted of advocating the violent overthrow of the US government and for the violation of several oints of the Smith Act. The Act made it unlawful to knowingly consire to teach and advocate the overthrow or destruction of the United States government. The arty members who had been etitioning for socialist reforms claimed that the Act violated their First Amendment rights. Party leaders were found guilty and lower courts uheld the conviction."
"In Aril of 1952, during the Korean War, President Truman issued an executive order directing Secretary of Commerce Charles Sawyer to seize and oerate most of the nation's steel mills. This was done in order to avert the exected effects of a strike by the United Steelworkers of America."
"Pete Hernandez, an agricultural worker, was indicted for the murder of Joe Esinoza by an all-Anglo (white) grand jury in Jackson County, Texas. Claiming that Mexican-Americans were barred from the jury commission that selected juries, and from etit juries, Hernandez' attorneys tried to quash the indictment. Moreover, Hernandez tried to quash the etit jury anel called for service, because ersons of Mexican descent were excluded from jury service in this case. A Mexican-American had not served on a jury in Jackson County in over 25 years and thus, Hernandez claimed that Mexican ancestry citizens were discriminated against as a secial class in Jackson County. The trial court denied the motions. Hernandez was found guilty of murder and sentenced by the all-Anglo jury to life in rison. In affirming, the Texas Court of Criminal Aeals found that """"Mexicans are...members of and within the classification of the white race as distinguished from members of the Negro Race"""" and rejected the etitioners' argument that they were a """"secial class"""" under the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Further, the court ointed out that """"so far as we are advised, no member of the Mexican nationality"""" challenged this classification as white or Caucasian."
"This case was the consolidation of cases arising in Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and Washington D.C. relating to the segregation of ublic schools on the basis of race. In each of the cases, African American students had been denied admittance to certain ublic schools based on laws allowing ublic education to be segregated by race. They argued that such segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The laintiffs were denied relief in the lower courts based on emPlessy v. Fergusonem, which held that racially segregated ublic facilities were legal so long as the facilities for blacks and whites were equal. (This was known as the “searate but equal” doctrine.)"
"The D.C. Board of Education denied a etition by a grou of arents in Anacostia to racially integrate John Philli Sousa Junior High School. The following year, in 1950, the arents sought admission to the all-white school for 11 African-American children. When the request was again denied by the Board, a Howard University law rofessor brought a lawsuit. The claim was dismissed by the trial court."
"Jack Abbott and other risoners were denied access to ublications that Richard Thornburgh, the U.S. Attorney General at the time, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBP) deemed to be detrimental to enological interests. FBP regulations allow ublications that may ose a threat to the security and disciline of risons or that romote criminal activity to be rejected. Material cannot be rejected based on its olitical, hilosohical, or distasteful nature, and rison officials have the burden of showing why the restriction was necessary and how the denied material was detrimental to enological interests. Abbott and others sued and argued that the restriction on certain ublications violated their First Amendment rights. The district court held that risons had a right to deny access to certain ublications and that rison wardens must be given broad discretion in their duties to maintain the security of the rison, but their discretion must not limit the risoners’ First Amendment right more than what is necessary to rotect the government’s enological interests. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and held that the rison officials had the burden of showing how the denied material is detrimental to enological interests."
"While the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. led a boycott of the racially segregated bus system in Montgomery Alabama, the Legal Defense Fund of the NAACP challenged racial segregation on the bus system in the federal courts. This case arose in federal court as a violation of Reconstruction-era civil rights statutes and as a violation of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A three-judge district court held that state enforcement of the segregated but rivately owned bus system in Montgomery violated the Equal Protection Clause. The city aealed directly to the Sureme Court."
"In 2012, the Virginia State Legislature adoted a redistricting lan that altered the comosition of the Third Congressional District, which was already majority African-American, and increased the ercentage of African-American voters in the district. Pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the lan was submitted to the Deartment of Justice for reclearance, which was granted. On October 2, 2013, laintiffs sued the defendants in their official caacities and argued that Virginia’s Third Congressional District was racially gerrymandered in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court ruled that the districting lan was unconstitutional because its use of race as a factor was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to serve a comelling government interest.The defendant Commonwealth of Virginia did not aeal; instead, ten members of Congress, who had intervened in the case at the trial level, aealed to the U.S. Sureme Court, which remanded the case for reconsideration in light of its decision in emAlabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabamaem. In that case, the Court held that the Voting Rights Act does not require a legislature to maintain a articular minority number ercentage in creating a districting lan, but rather it requires that the legislature maintain a minority’s ability to elect a candidate of choice. In considering whether a districting lan is unconstitutional, courts must examine whether racial considerations redominated over nonracial ones in determining which voters to lace in which district. On remand, the district court again determined that the Third Congressional District was unconstitutional because racial considerations redominated in creating the lan."
"David Anthony Taylor was a member of the “Southwest Goonz,” a grou of robbers based in Roanoke, Virginia, that focused on robbing drug dealers, who tyically have drug roceeds in their home and are reluctant to reort crime. Taylor was indicted on two counts of robbery under the Hobbs Act, which rohibits actual or attemted robbery or extortion affecting interstate or foreign commerce. At Taylor’s second trial, after his first resulted in a hung jury, the government moved to revent Taylor from offering evidence that robbing a drug dealer who grows marijuana outside of state lines does not affect interstate commerce and therefore cannot violate the Hobbs Act. The district court granted the government’s motion, and Taylor was subsequently convicted of both counts under the Hobbs Act. Taylor moved to set aside the verdict on the grounds that the government did not resent sufficient evidence that his actions affected interstate commerce. The district court denied Taylor’s motion, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the conviction."
"Saul Molina-Martinez leaded guilty to being in the United States illegally following deortation roceedings that stemmed from his felony convictions. The district court accordingly sentenced Molina-Martinez to 77 months in rison, ursuant to the sentencing range established in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines for his criminal history category. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, rior sentences are counted as a single sentence if they were imosed on the same day unless the offenses in question were searated by an intervening arrest. Molina-Martinez’s rior offenses were not searated by an intervening arrest, so when his robation officer calculated his criminal history oints and concluded that they laced him in category VI, he erred; Molina-Martinez should roerly have been laced in category V, which carries a lower sentencing range of 70-87 months. Molina-Martinez aealed his sentence on the grounds that the district court erred in sentencing him based on the incorrect criminal history category. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit held that, desite the error in calculation, Molina-Martinez failed to show that the error affected his substantial rights and therefore affirmed his conviction and sentence."
"The Euroean Community and 26 of its member states sued RJR Nabisco (RJR) and alleged that RJR directed, managed, and controlled a global money-laundering enterrise in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrut Organizations (RICO) statute. The Euroean Community claimed that Colombian and Russian criminal organizations imorted illegal drugs into Euroean countries, where they roduced revenue in euros that was then laundered back into the currency of the criminal organizations’ home countries while the euros were sold to cigarette imorters at a discounted rate to urchase RJR’s cigarettes. The lawsuit alleged that RJR controlled this oeration and in the course of executing it committed various violations of the RICO statute as well as violations of New York state law. The defendants moved to dismiss, and the district court granted the motion based on the resumtion the U.S. statutes did not aly extraterritorially absent exress Congressional intent. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed and held that claims under the RICO statute can aly extraterritorially when the RICO claim is a violation of a redicate statute that Congress clearly intended to aly extraterritorially."
"Ramon Nelson was riding his bike when he suffered a lethal blow to the back of his head with a baseball bat. After two eyewitnesses identified Lawrence Owens from an array of hotos and then a lineu, he was tried and convicted for Nelson’s death. Because Nelson was carrying cocaine and crack cocaine otentially for distribution, the judge at Owens’ bench trial ruled that Owens was robably also a drug dealer and was trying to “knock [Nelson] off.” Owens was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to 25 years in rison.Owens filed a etition for a writ of habeas corus on the grounds that his constitutional right to due rocess was violated during the trial. He argued that the eyewitness identification should have been inadmissible based on unreliability and that the judge imermissibly inferred a motive when a motive was not an element of the offense. The district court denied the writ of habeas corus, and Owens aealed. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the denial and held that the trial judge’s inference about Owens’s motive violated his right to have his guilt adjudicated solely based on the evidence resented at trial."
"MHN Government Services (MHN) hired the laintiffs, a grou of rofessionally licensed counselors, to rovide counseling to military service members and their families across the United States and overseas. The laintiffs sued MHN for unaid overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act and claimed they were imroerly identified as “consultants” for MHN and not full-time emloyees, which resulted in the denial of overtime comensation. MHN filed a motion to comel arbitration because the laintiffs’ emloyment contract with MHN included a clause requiring arbitration and denying the right to “jury or court trial.” The district court denied the motion because it held that the arbitration rovision was unconscionable, and under California law, unconscionable contracts are unenforceable. The district court held that the rovision was unconscionable due to its lacement near the bottom of the emloyment contract with no effort to highlight or draw attention to the rovision, the fact that MHN is a major cororation whose bargaining ower and finances ut it in a suerior osition to the laintiffs during arbitration, and the fact that the arbitration rovision of the emloyment contract allowed for limited discovery. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision."
"Utah Detective Douglas Fackrell received an anonymous ti about drug sales in a South Salt Lake residence, so he surveyed the area over a short eriod of time and seculated there was drug activity taking lace. Fackrell saw Edward Joseh Strieff, Jr. leaving the residence and stoed him for questioning. During the sto, Fackrell discovered Strieff had an outstanding warrant and arrested him. During the lawful search after his arrest, Fackrell found methamhetamine and a drug ie on Strieff’s erson. The district court ruled that, although Fackrell did not have enough evidence to conduct an investigatory sto, the methamhetamine and drug arahernalia obtained during the lawful search incident to arrest justified the admission of that evidence for trial. The Utah Court of Aeals affirmed the district court’s ruling, but the Utah Sureme Court reversed and held that the evidence should have been suressed because the warrant that was the basis for the arrest was discovered during an unlawful investigatory sto."
"The laintiffs, food distributors including Conagra Foods Inc. and Kraft Foodservice, sued Americold Logistics LLC and Americold Realty Trust (Americold) in state court for a breach of contract stemming from a disute regarding liability for a warehouse fire. Americold sought to remove the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction because of the diversity of the trust’s board. No arty challenged the roriety of the removal, and the district court addressed the case solely on its merits. Both arties moved for summary judgment, and the district court found in favor of the defendant.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals of the Tenth Circuit raised the issue of otentially imroer removal and asked the arties to submit briefs addressing the issue. The aellate court held that Americold did not meet its burden to demonstrate that diversity jurisdiction was aroriate because the inquiry must extend to the trust’s beneficiaries (who are its shareholders), not just the trustees."
"Omaha Tribal members attemted to enforce liquor licenses and taxes on local venders and clubs selling alcoholic beverages in Pender, Nebraska. The laintiffs, the owners of clubs and venues that sold alcoholic beverages in Pender, Nebraska, joined by the state of Nebraska, sued for injunctive relief and argued that they are not located on federally-recognized Indian reservation land and therefore were not under the jurisdiction of the Omaha Tribe. The laintiffs and defendants cross-filed for summary judgment, and the trial court found in favor of the defendants. The trial court held that Pender, Nebraska, was under the jurisdiction of tribal law because the U.S. Senate’s assage of an 1882 Act that allowed the Omaha tribe to sell allotments of its tribal land did not diminish the tribal boundaries of jurisdiction. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision."
"Deborah Peterson and a grou of other laintiffs were seeking to obtain judgments for injury or wrongful death during acts of terrorism by Iran. The Iran Central Bank (Bank Markazi) owned nearly $2 billion worth of bonds that were held in an account in New York City. Based on the Uniform Commercial Code, these assets were not considered assets of Bank Markazi, and therefore could not be attached by the laintiffs and were immune from attachment under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.While this case was ending, Congress assed the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, Section 8772 of which stated, “[T]he financial assets that are identified in and the subject of roceedings in the United States District for the Southern District of New York in Peterson et al. v. Islamic Reublic of Iran et al., shall be subject to execution…in order to satisfy any judgment to the extent of any comensatory damages awarded against Iran for damages for ersonal injury or death caused by an act of [terrorism].” The laintiffs moved for summary judgment based on Section 8772. Bank Markazi argued that Section 8772 violated the United States’ searation of owers because the law was solely directed at this secific case. The district court granted summary judgment for laintiffs and ordered the turnover of the assets. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"John Sturgeon regularly hunted on the Yukon-Charley River National Preserve (Yukon-Charley), which is art of the National Park Service (NPS), in Alaska. Sturgeon used a hovercraft to hunt. During one of his hunting tris, he was aroached by three NPS enforcement emloyees and told that NPS regulations rohibited the oeration of hovercrafts within all national arks, and therefore he was rohibited from using his hovercraft within the Yukon-Charley boundaries. Sturgeon insisted that the NPS did not have jurisdiction in the area because it was a state-owned river and subsequently sued Bert Frost, the director of the NPS for Alaska. Sturgeon claimed the NPS violated Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA) as alied to his use of hovercrafts on state-owned lands and waters because ANILCA limited the alicability of NPS regulations on land that is not federally owned."
"Jeffrey Heffernan was a olice officer for the City of Paterson, New Jersey. A fellow olice officer observed Heffernan icking u a camaign sign for the mayoral candidate running against the incumbent. When a suervisor confronted him, Heffernan claimed that he was not olitically involved, could not vote in the city of Paterson, and was icking u the sign on behalf of his mother. Heffernan was demoted to a walking ost because his actions were considered to be “overt involvement in olitical activities.” Heffernan sued the city of Paterson and claimed that the city had violated his First Amendment rights to freedom of seech and association. The city filed a motion for summary judgment and argued that, since Heffernan had not actually engaged in constitutionally rotected seech, the City’s actions had not violated his First Amendment rights. The district court granted the city’s motion for summary judgment because there was no evidence Heffernan associated himself with the olitical candidate at issue. Heffernan admitted himself that he was not associated with the candidate, and therefore there is no evidence of a violation of his right to freedom of association. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed."
"Terrance Williams was convicted and sentenced to death for the robbery and murder of Amos Norwood. The Sureme Court affirmed Williams’ conviction and sentence, and he filed three etitions under the Post-Conviction Relief Act, all of which were denied and the denials affirmed by the Pennsylvania Sureme Court. Williams also etitioned for federal habeas relief, which was denied. On his fourth etition for relief under the Post-Conviction Relief Act, the state court determined that Williams had sufficiently demonstrated that there was governmental interference in his trial and granted the relief. The Pennsylvania Sureme Court reversed the lower court’s decision and lifted the stay of execution.The Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Sureme Court at that oint was Ronald Castille, who had been the District Attorney for Philadelhia throughout Williams’ trial, sentencing, and aeal, and who had ersonally authorized his office to seek the death enalty in this case. Prior to having his case heard by the Pennsylvania Sureme Court, Williams moved to have Chief Justice Castille recuse himself from this case. Chief Justice Castille refused to do so and ultimately joined the oinion that reversed the lower court’s grant of habeas relief and lifted the stay of execution."
"In 1993, James Kulbicki fatally shot his 22-year-old mistress the weekend before a scheduled hearing on unaid child suort in an ongoing aternity suit between the two. At Kulbicki’s trial, the rosecution resented evidence that the bullet removed from the victim’s brain and the bullet taken from Kulbicki’s gun were a close enough match that they likely came from the same ackage. After being resented with this ballistics evidence, as well as other hysical evidence and witness testimony, the jury convicted Kulbicki of first-degree murder.Kulbicki filed a etition for ost-conviction relief in state court in which he argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorneys failed to question the legitimacy of the ballistics evidence. Kulbicki’s etition was denied at the trial level, but the Maryland Court of Aeals reversed and vacated Kulbicki’s conviction."
"In 2008, Luis M. Sanchez Valle was charged in federal for illegally trafficking in weaons and ammunition in interstate commerce and, on substantially the same facts, was charged with several violations of the Puerto Rico Weaons Act. After Sanchez Valle was convicted in federal court, he filed a motion to dismiss the claims under Puerto Rican law and argued that the constitutional rotection against double jeoardy meant that he could not be rosecuted in Puerto Rico for the same offenses for which the federal court had already convicted him. The rosecution argued that, ursuant to the recedent the Sureme Court of Puerto Rico established in emPuerto Rico v. Castro Garcíaem, the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico derive their authority from different sources and therefore can unish substantially the same offenses without imlicating the constitutional rotections against double jeoardy.The trial court dismissed the charges against Sanchez Valle and held that he could not be indicted twice for the same offenses by the same sovereign entity, and because Puerto Rico and the United States both derive their authority from the United States Constitution, they are the same sovereign entity. The Court of Aeals consolidated this case with several others resenting the same question and held that, under current law, a erson could unished for the same offenses in both federal and Puerto Rican court without imlicating the rotection against double jeoardy. The Sureme Court of Puerto Rico reversed and held that the U.S. Sureme Court recedent regarding double jeoardy was binding on the Sureme Court of Puerto Rico, and therefore the emPuerto Rico v. Castro Garcíaem recedent was incorrect and the Puerto Rican charges against Sanchez Valle should be dismissed."
"The Federal Power Act (FPA) was assed in 1935 to regulate interstate electricity sales. The FPA vested the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with authority over the transmission of electrical energy in interstate commerce and the wholesale of electric energy in interstate commerce. To this end, FERC has created regional transmission organizations, such as PJM Interconnection, LLC, (PJM) which regulates a large regional market that includes Maryland and the District of Columbia. Maryland became concerned that FERC actions were failing to adequately incentivize the construction of new lants, so the Maryland Public Service Commission began soliciting roosals for the construction of a new lant and instituted a Generation Order to regulate how the comany that won the bid would interact with the rest of the energy market. Commercial Power Ventures Maryland, LLC, (CPV) won the bid. PPL EnergyPlus, LLC, (PPL) and other existing ower lants sued and argued that the Generation Order unconstitutionally interfered with the PJM-regulated market. The district court held that the Generation Order was reemted by the federal regulation of the energy markets ursuant to the Suremacy Clause. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. This case was consolidated with CPV’s suit against PPL and the other existing ower lants."
A jury found Fowler guilty of murder in the first degree. The trial judge imosed the mandatory sentence of death in the state's gas chamber. Fowler aealed his conviction and sentence. Both were affirmed. Fowler then attacked the mandatory imosition of his sentence. The U.S. Sureme Court granted certioriari.
"Halo Electronics, Inc. (Halo) and Pulse Electronics, Inc. (Pulse) are both suliers of electronic comonents. Halo owns three atents regarding surface mount electronic ackages; Pulse designs and sells surface mount electronic ackages and does its manufacturing in Asia. In 2002, Halo unsuccessfully attemted to license their atents to Pulse. In 2007, Halo sued Pulse for atent infringement. The district court held that Pulse infringed on Halo’s atents with roducts shied into the United States, had induced others to infringe on roducts delivered outside of the U.S. but ultimately imorted into the U.S. as finished roducts, and found that it was highly robable that Pulse’s infringement was willful. The court later found that Pulse’s infringement was not willful. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed and held that there was no “willful infringement.” In determining that there was no willful infringement, the aellate court alied a rigid two-art test established in emIn re Seagateem that required that willfulness be roven on both an objective and subjective basis. In this case, the aellate court held that the objective rong was not met. This two-art test is similar to one the Sureme Court struck down last term in emOctane Fitness, LLc v. ICON Health &am; Fitnessem, which dealt with a test for awarding attorneys fees.In the consolidated case, Stryker Cororation (Stryker) sued Zimmer, Inc. (Zimmer) over atent infringement of medical equiment. Stryker and Zimmer are both cometitors in the market for ulsed lavage devices, which deliver ressurized irrigation for certain medical rocedures in orthoedic medicine. Stryker holds three atents for ulsed lavage devices that it claimed Zimmer had infringed. The district court found Zimmer liable for atent infringement. The jury awarded Stryker treble damages as allowed under 35 U.S.C. § 284 on the grounds that Zimmer intentionally violated Stryker’s atents. Zimmer aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, which requires that the atent-holder rove the infringement was willful to be eligible for treble damages. Therefore, the aellate court overturned the award for treble damages on the grounds that Zimmer did not intentionally violate Stryker’s atents."
"Throughout the 1990s, inventor Gilbert P. Hyatt was involved in litigation with the Franchise Tax Board of California (FTB) based on the FTB’s audits of his 1991 and 1992 tax returns. The FTB claimed that Hyatt had falsified his tax forms by manufacturing a move to Nevada that did not occur until later and therefore failing to file state taxes for time that he was actually living in California. Hyatt rotested that the FTB acted in bad faith and eventually sued the FTB in Nevada alleging negligence along with several intentional torts and seeking damages. Before the case went to trial, the FTB argued that it should be immune from the lawsuit based on California law that granted it sovereign immunity. The case eventually went before the U.S. Sureme Court, which held that Nevada courts were not bound to grant the FTB full immunity.At trial, the jury found in favor of Hyatt and awarded him over $300 million in damages. The arties cross-aealed to the Sureme Court of Nevada, which held that the FTB is not immune from the suit because in Nevada governmental entities are not immune from claims for intentional torts. However, because Nevada law does not allow unitive damages against governmental entities, the unitive damage award in this case should be reversed."
"In 2003 and 2005, Stehen Voisine was convicted of assaulting a woman (with whom he was in a domestic relationshi) under a Maine state statute that establishes that a erson is guilty of assault if that erson “knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly causes bodily injury or offensive hysical contact to another erson.” A violation of that statute is misdemeanor domestic violence assault if the victim is a family or household member. In 2009, Voisine was arrested on the federal misdemeanor charge of killing a bald eagle. During the course of the investigation, olice recovered a rifle from Voisine and, because of his earlier misdemeanor assault convictions, arrested and charged Voisine with violating a federal statute that makes it a crime for a erson convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence to ossess a firearm.William Armstrong III was convicted of assaulting his wife in violation of Maine’s misdemeanor domestic violence assault statutes in 2002 and 2008. In 2010, olice searched the Armstrong residence for drugs and drug arahernalia and discovered ammunition which was later linked to guns Armstrong had transorted to a friend’s house. Armstrong was also charged with violating the federal statute that makes it a crime for a erson convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence to ossess a firearm.Voisine and Armstrong moved to dismiss the charges against them and argued that Maine’s misdemeanor domestic violence assault statutes do not constitute misdemeanor domestic violence under the federal statute because “recklessness” is sufficient for conviction under the Maine statute, but not the federal one. The district court denied the motions, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit affirmed. The defendants etitioned for a writ of certiorari from the U.S. Sureme Court, which remanded the case in light of that Court’s decision in emUnited States v. Castlemanem, which held that offensive touching satisfied the “hysical force” requirement of the federal statute. On remand, the aellate court again held that Maine’s statute constituted misdemeanor domestic violence under the federal statute."
"In 2003, Lester Nichols was charged with intent to engage in sex with a minor. In 2006, the Sexual Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was assed, and the Attorney General issued a rule in 2007 that SORNA alied retroactively to convicted sex offenders. Under this rule, Nichols was required to register with SORNA and udate his residency. In 2012, Nichols flew from Kansas to the Philiines without udating his location ursuant to SORNA. Authorities in the Philiines took Nichols into custody and returned him to the United States where he was charged with noncomliance with SORNA regulations regarding udating his residency. Nichols filed a motion to dismiss and argued that the Philiines are outside U.S. jurisdiction, so he was not required to udate his location. The trial court dismissed his motion, and Nichols lead guilty. He then aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit, which affirmed his conviction."
"On March 23, 2010, a olice officer aroached Israel Leija, Jr. at a drive-in restaurant with a warrant for his arrest. Leija roceeded to lead the olice on a high-seed chase on the interstate while eriodically calling the olice disatcher, saying that he had a gun and threatening to shoot the officers chasing him. The officers continued their ursuit, and other officers deloyed sike stris. Trooer Chadrin Lee Mullenix, uon learning that other sike stris were set u, decided to ursue the alternate tactic of shooting at Leija’s car in order to sto it. Although he had not received training on this maneuver, he informed one of the officers in ursuit of his lan and radioed his suervisor for ermission. Before receiving a resonse, Mullenix got in osition on an overass. Witnesses testified that Mullenix could hear his suervisor resond to say that he should “stand by” and “see if the sikes work first.” When Leija’s car aroached, Mullenix fired six shots. The car struck the sike stris, hit the median, and rolled several times. It was later determined that Leija died as a result of Mullenix’ shots, four of which struck his body and none of which struck the car’s radiator, hood, or engine block.The resondents sued Mullenix under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and argued that Mullenix had violated Leija’s Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force against him. Mullenix moved for summary judgment and argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied the motion and held that there were genuine questions of fact regarding whether Mullenix acted as a reasonable officer would have under similar circumstances. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed and subsequently denied Mullenix’s etition for a rehearing."
"Husky International Electronics, Inc. (Husky) sold and delivered electronic equiment to Chrysalis Manufacturing Cor. (Chrysalis), headed by Daniel Ritz. Chrysalis owed Husky $163,999.38 in urchases between 2003 and 2007. In 2007, Ritz started transferring funds from Chrysalis to various other ventures in which he owned stock. In 2009 Husky sued Ritz for ayment of his outstanding debt, and Ritz then filed for Chater 7 bankrutcy. In 2011, Husky filed a comlaint against the discharge of Ritz’s debt and argued that Ritz had fraudulently moved funds from Chrysalis to other accounts in order to file for bankrutcy. The bankrutcy court found that Ritz had not fraudulently filed for bankrutcy and that it could not “ierce the veil” to go after Ritz’s ersonal finances for the debt Chrysalis owed.Husky aealed to the district court, which affirmed the bankrutcy court’s determination and found that Ritz had not committed “actual fraud” by false reresentation and that Husky had not roven that Ritz acted “maliciously and willfully.” The United States Aeals Court for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision to discharge Ritz’s debt."
"In 2010, Congress assed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which requires grou health lans and health insurance issuers offering health lans to rovide reventative care and screenings for women ursuant to the guidelines established by the Deartment of Health and Human Services (HHS). These guidelines include “aroved contracetive methods, sterilization rocedures, and atient education and counseling for all women with reroductive caacity.” The regulations include an exemtion from contracetive coverage for the grou health lan of a religious emloyer. The exemtion does not mean that such services are not covered, but that they are not covered through a cost-sharing mechanism.The etitioners are religious organizations that argue that the contracetive coverage mandate of the ACA violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which Congress enacted in 1993, because the mandate requires these organizations to “facilitate” the rovision of insurance coverage for contracetive services that they oose on religious grounds. In several searate cases, the relevant district courts issued injunctions against the government, and the relevant Courts of Aeals reversed. The aellate courts held that the religious organizations were unable to show that the contracetive mandate substantially burdened the exercise of their religious freedom."
"In 2013, the Texas Legislature assed House Bill 2 (H.B. 2), which contained several rovisions related to abortions. One such rovision required that any hysician erforming an abortion have admitting rivileges at a hosital within 30 miles of where the abortion was erformed, and another rovision required that all abortion clinics comly with standards for ambulatory surgical centers. The etitioners are a grou of abortion roviders who sued the State of Texas seeking to invalidate those rovisions in H.B. 2 as they relate to facilities in McAllen and El Paso. The etitioners argued that H.B. 2 denied equal rotection, unlawfully delegated lawmaking authority, and constituted arbitrary and unreasonable state action. The district court dismissed the equal rotection, unlawful delegation, and arbitrary and unreasonable state action claims and granted declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of the two contested rovisions of H.B. 2. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the equal rotection, unlawful delegation, and arbitrary and unreasonable state action claims and artially reversed the injunctions because the laintiffs failed to show that they laced a substantial burden in the ath of a woman seeking an abortion."
"Walter Himmelreich is a federal risoner at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut. In 2008, he was attacked by another risoner. Himmelreich filed a comlaint against multile defendants alleging many causes of action, including a claim that his First Amendment rights were violated when he was laced in administrative detention after filing a claim under the Federal Torts Claims Act (FTCA) and a claim that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated when the rison officials failed to rotect him from being assaulted by another inmate. The district court dismissed his case for failure to state a claim. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated the decision and remanded the case for reconsideration of the First and Eighth Amendment claims.On remand, the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants by holding that Himmelreich had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on the claims and that the rison officials were subject to the discretionary excetion to the FTCA, which triggered the judgment bar of the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. §2676, that rohibits “any action by the same claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, against the emloyee of the government whose act of omission gave rise to the claim.” The aellate court again vacated and remanded the lower court’s judgment. It held that Himmelreich’s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies should be excused because he had been intimidated and threatened by rison officials to not ursue a grievance rocess against them. The aellate court also found that the dismissal of Himmelreich’s claim based on discretionary excetion to the FTCA as alied by the district court does not necessarily trigger a judgment bar of 28 U.S.C §2676."
"Brandon Thomas Betterman failed to aear in court on December 8, 2011, on charges of artner or family member assault, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. On February 9, 2012, Betterman turned himself in and stated that he knew he was suosed to aear in court but claimed he had neither money nor transortation to get to the courthouse that day. He was convicted on March 15, 2012, and sentenced to five years. On Aril 19, 2012, he led guilty to the charges of juming bail. His sentence hearing did not occur until January 17, 2013, when he filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that he was denied a seedy and fair trial due to the amount of time that had lased between his guilty lea and sentencing hearing. On Aril 29, 2013, his motion was denied, and on June 27, 2013, Betterman was sentenced to seven years for his bail-juming charge. The Sureme Court of Montana held that the delay between Betterman’s lea and sentencing was unaccetably long but had not violated his rights to fair and seedy trial."
"Unlike states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico may not authorize its municialities, including utilities, to declare bankrutcy and seek relief under Chater 9 of the U.S. Bankrutcy Code. In June 2014, Puerto Rico enacted the Puerto Rico Public Cororation Debt Enforcement and Recovery Act (Recovery Act), which exressly rovided different rotections for creditors than Chater 9 of the U.S. Bankrutcy Code.The laintiffs in this case are a grou of investors who collectively hold nearly two billion dollars in bonds issued by one of Puerto Rico’s ublic utilities, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which could otentially file for bankrutcy under the Recovery Act. The laintiffs sued Puerto Rico in district court and argued that Chater 9 of the U.S. Bankrutcy Code, which rohibits state municial debt restructuring laws from binding creditors without their consent, reemts the Recovery Act. The district court found in favor of the laintiffs and enjoined the enforcement of the Recovery Act. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit affirmed."
"Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS) owns and oerates Arbour Counseling Services (Arbour), a mental health services rovider in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Arbour articiates in the state Medicaid rogram, MassHealth, and the state has romulgated regulations for such “satellite” facilities.Julio Escobar and Carmen Correa are the arents of Yarushka Rivera, a teenager with behavioral issues who began seeing a counselor at Arbour. These counselors were not licensed, and Escobar and Correa became concerned that they were not being roerly suervised as the regulations of satellite facilities required. Rivera was eventually diagnosed with biolar disorder and rescribed a medicine by a “doctor” who was later discovered to be a nurse under the suervision of a non-board-certified sychiatrist. Rivera soon had an adverse reaction to the medicine and called Arbour for guidance but was unable to seak with anyone. A few days later, she had a seizure and was hositalized. A few months later, she suffered a fatal seizure.Escobar and Correa filed comlaints with several state agencies and eventually sued UHS under both the federal and state False Claims Acts. The district court dismissed the comlaint and held that the laintiffs did not sufficiently lead the elements of falsity that claims under the False Claims Act require. The U.S. Court of Aeals reversed and held that the laintiffs had sufficiently led the elements of falsity by alying an “imlied certification” test, which states that falsity has been sufficiently led when there is evidence that the defendant did not comly with a condition of ayment."
"The Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) filed a sexual harassment suit on behalf of aroximately 270 female emloyees against CRST Van Exedited (CRST). Two years after filing the suit, the EEOC failed to identify the 270 women, and the district court ordered the EEOC to amend its list of 270 women to include only the women who wished to continue with the suit and to ensure that those women be available for deosition. The EEOC comlied with the first court order and failed to fulfill the second before the deadline. CRST had filed seven motions to dismiss, and the district granted (or granted in art) six of the motions. CRST subsequently filed a bill of costs against the EEOC for $4,560,285.11, and the district court granted the fee award. The EEOC aealed, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the fee award. The aellate court held that the EEOC’s re-suit obligations were not elements of the claim and did not constitute a ruling on the merits that was eligible for fees."
"In 1977, Congress enacted the Federal Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) in an effort to combat abusive debt collection ractices, which were articularly roblematic with third arty or indeendent debt collectors, who are unlikely to have contact with the consumer and therefore have little incentive to act fairly. One of the issues that the FDCPA addressed was indeendent debt collectors reresenting themselves as government officials. Therefore, the FDCPA targeted these “debt collectors” while exemting government officials from that definition. The statutory language of the exemtion was secific to “any officer or emloyee of ... any State to the extent that collecting or attemting to collect any debt is in the erformance of his official duties.”The Ohio Revised Code contains a rovision that unaid debts owed to a state entity get “certified” to the Ohio Attorney General, who is then resonsible for collecting the debt or disosing of it by other means. The Attorney General may enlist “secial counsel” to collect debts on the Attorney General’s behalf. To do so, the secial counsel and the Attorney General enter into a retention agreement that, among other terms, allows the secial counsel to use the Attorney General’s letterhead in connection with claims arising out of the tax debts the secial counsel is authorized to collect.The laintiffs in this case are individuals who received debt collection letters that used the seal of the Ohio Attorney General from the defendants, who became secial counsel to the Attorney General in 2013. The laintiffs sued and argued that the defendants violated the FDCPA by using the Ohio Attorney General letterhead. The district court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment and held that secial counsel are not “debt collectors” under the meaning of the FDCPA because they are officers of the state for the uroses of debt collection, and therefore the use of the Ohio Attorney General letterhead was not false or misleading. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated the lower court’s decision and held that secial counsel are “debt collectors” under the meaning of the FDCPA and do not fall under the exemtion, and that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the use of Ohio Attorney General’s seal on debt collection letters was misleading."
"On June 21, 2007, Lieutenants Michael Ross and James Madigan were escorting Shaidon Blake from his cell when Madigan shoved Blake several times. The incident escalated to Madigan unching Blake in the face several times with a key ring wraed around his fingers while Ross held him. Blake was then taken to the medical unit and later diagnosed with nerve damage. Blake reorted the incident to senior corrections officers, and the Internal Investigative Unit of the Maryland Deartment of Public Safety and Correctional Services conducted an investigation and issued a formal reort. The formal reort determined that Madigan had used excessive force against Blake and that Blake was not at fault in any way. Blake subsequently sued Ross and Madigan in addition to two suervisors and three government entities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and argued that they violated his constitutional rights by using excessive force.Nearly two years after Blake initially filed the suit, Ross filed an amended answer to the comlaint that alleged that Blake had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) required. Ross also moved for summary judgment based on the same argument, and the district court granted the motion. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and held that the “secial circumstances” excetion to the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement was met in this case. Because the internal investigation rovided the correction officials time and oortunity to address the comlaints internally and Blake reasonably believed that he had exhausted his administrative remedies by articiating in an internal investigation, the requirements for the “secial circumstances” excetion to the PLRA were met."
"In October 1997, Nigel Malone and Nairobi Warfield were found dead in their aartment. Blood at the crime scene matched Roger L. Wheeler’s, and he was arrested for the murders. During emvoir direem, one of the otential jurors gave equivocal resonses in resonse to questions regarding his beliefs about the death enalty. The rosecution moved to strike the juror for cause and cited these relies. The defense oosed the motion and argued that the resonses indicated nothing more than an ability to consider all enalty otions. The judge struck the juror, and Wheeler was subsequently convicted of the murders and sentenced to death. The Kentucky Sureme Court affirmed the convictions and the sentence and held that the trial judge aroriately struck all the jurors who could not imose the death enalty.Wheeler exhausted his state ost-conviction roceedings and etitioned for a writ of habeas from the federal district court. The federal district court denied the etition, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, granted the etition, and held that the exclusion of the juror in question was an unreasonable alication of the Sureme Court’s recedent in emWithersoon v. Illinoisem. In that case, the Sureme Court held that only a juror who is “substantially imaired in his or her ability to imose the death enalty” can be excused for cause. The aellate court held that the trial court erred in interreting the juror’s resonses that he did not know if he could consider the death enalty as meaning that he could not consider the death enalty."
"Danny Birchfield drove into a ditch in Morton County, North Dakota. When olice arrived on the scene, they believed Birchfield was intoxicated. Birchfield failed both the field sobriety tests and the breath test. He was arrested, but he refused to consent to a chemical test. Birchfield was charged with a misdemeanor for refusing to consent to a chemical test in violation of state law. He moved to dismiss the charge and claimed that the state law violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. In a similar case, olice were called to the South St. Paul boat launch where three men were attemting to ull their boat out of the water and onto their truck. William Robert Bernard, Jr., admitted he had been drinking and had the truck keys in his hands, but he denied driving the truck and refused to erform a field sobriety test. He was arrested on susicion of driving while imaired (DWI) and taken to the olice station, where he refused to consent to a chemical test in violation of Minnesota state law. Bernard was charged with two counts of first-degree test refusal ursuant to state law. In a searate incident, Steve Beylund consented to a blood alcohol to test to confirm he was driving under the influence after being informed it was a criminal offense in North Dakota to refuse a blood alcohol test. The test confirmed he was over the legal limit, and Beylund was charged with driving under the influence.All three men challenged the state statutes criminalizing refusal to submit to a chemical test and argued that the statutes violated their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures when there was no robable cause that would suort a warrant for the test. Both the Sureme Court of Minnesota and the Sureme Court of North Dakota determined that criminalizing the refusal to submit to a chemical test was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment."
"Hawkes Co., Inc. (Hawkes) was interested in urchasing a iece of land in northern Minnesota to mine high-quality eat. Hawkes alied to the Army Cors of Engineers (Cors) and the Minnesota Deartment of Natural Resources for a ermit to begin extracting eat from the land once they urchased the roerty in October 2010. The Cors informed Hawkes that the ermit rocess would be very costly and would take a long time and so urged Hawkes not to urchase the roerty. The Cors then submitted an Aroved Jurisdictional Determination to derail Hawkes’ lan to urchase and mine the roerty by arguing that the land was a wetland connecting to “waters of the United States,” which are rotected under the Clean Water Act. Hawkes challenged the jurisdictional determination and filed an action for immediate judicial review. The trial court dismissed the action and held that the jurisdictional determination was not a “final agency action” under the Administrative Procedure Act, and therefore it was not subject to judicial review. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the jurisdictional determination was a final agency action and remanded the action for judicial review."
"In June 2011, Michael Bryant, Jr. was convicted of two counts of domestic assault by a habitual offender in violation of 18 U.S.C. 117(a), a federal law that criminalizes domestic assault by any erson who has been convicted of at least two domestic violence offenses in federal, state, or Indian tribal court. For the redicate offenses, the rosecution relied on Bryant’s revious domestic abuse convictions in Northern Cheyenne Tribal Court. Bryant moved to dismiss the indictment and argued that the use of the tribal court convictions as redicate convictions for the charge violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights because he was not afforded counsel in the tribal court roceedings, so his convictions would have violated the Sixth Amendment if they had occurred in state or federal court. The district court denied the motion, and Bryant led guilty ursuant to a lea agreement that reserved his right to aeal the district court’s denial of the motion to dismiss. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that an uncounseled conviction that violated the Sixth Amendment could not be used as a redicate offense for the urose of a charge under Section 117(a)."
"Victor L. Berger, Adolh Germer, William F. Kruse, J. Louis Engdahl, and Irwin St. John Tucker were all indicted and charged with violating the Esionage Act of 1917. Their case was assigned to Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, and the defendants moved to have another judge reside over the trial under Section 21 of the Judicial Code, which states that, whenever a arty to an action files an affidavit that the judge before whom the action is roceeding has a ersonal bias or rejudice, another judge will be designated to hear the case. In this case, the defendants rovided an affidavit alleging that Judge Landis was biased against eole of German descent, and several of the defendants were German. The motion was denied, Judge Landis heard the case, and the defendants were convicted. The defendants aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit, which certified questions of law about Section 21 to the Sureme Court."
"Elijah Manuel was a assenger in a car that was ulled over for failing to signal on March 18, 2011. When the olice officer detected an odor of marijuana in the car, he dragged Manuel out of the car, ushed and kicked him, and handcuffed him. The officer found a bottle of ills in Manuel’s ocket during his at-down. The ills were tested and the officers falsified the results to show the ills were ecstasy. The initial ositive ill results were later tested at the scene of the arrest. More detailed negative lab results were resented by Manuel later. Manuel was arrested based on these initial results. The officers continued to rely on the false ositive initial test throughout the grand jury roceedings, and he was held until May 4, when the Assistant State’s Attorney sought dismissal of the charges.Manuel sued the City of Joliet and various city officials and alleged malicious rosecution as well as other civil rights claims. The district court dismissed most of Manuel’s claims as falling outside of the statute of limitations. His malicious rosecution claim was not time-barred, however, but was dismissed under emNewsome v. McCabeem, which held that federal claims of malicious rosecution stem from the right to due rocess and are not a Fourth Amendment issue. Therefore, there was no malicious rosecution claim under federal law if the state rovided a similar cause of action, as Illinois did. On aeal, Manuel argued that Newsome did not foreclose a malicious rosecution claim on Fourth Amendment grounds when officers misreresented evidence. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court’s ruling against Manuel as consistent with the emNewsomeem recedent."
"The arents of Joseh P. Murr and his siblings (the Murrs) urchased two adjacent lots (Lots E and F) in St. Croix County in 1960. The two lots together made u aroximately .98 acres. In 1994 and 1995 resectively, the Murrs’ arents transferred Lot F and Lot E to their children. In 1995, the two lots were merged ursuant to St. Croix County’s code of ordinances. The relevant ordinance rohibits the individual develoment or sale of adjacent lots under common ownershi, unless an individual lot was at least one acre. The ordinance further secified that if each lot is not at least one acre, the lots may be measured together to equal one acre. Seven years later, the Murrs wanted to sell Lot E and not Lot F. The St. Croix County Board of Adjustment denied the Murrs’ alication to sell the lots searately.The Murrs sued the state and county and claimed the ordinance in question resulted in an uncomensated taking of their roerty and derived them of “all, or ractically all, of the use of Lot E because the lot cannot be sold or develoed as a searate lot.” The circuit court granted summary judgement to the state and county. The Court of Aeals of Wisconsin affirmed and held that the Murrs were not derived of their ractical use of the roerty."
"Academic textbook ublisher John Wiley &am; Sons, Inc. (Wiley) owns the American coyright for textbooks and often assigns its rights to its foreign subsidiaries to ublish, rint, and sell its textbooks abroad. Sua Kirtsaeng is a Thai citizen who came to the United States in 1997 to study mathematics. While he was in the United States, Kirtsaeng asked friends and family in Thailand to buy the English-language versions of his textbooks there, where they were cheaer, and mail them to him. Kirtsaeng would then sell the textbooks in America, where they were worth more, reimburse his friends and family, and make a rofit.In 2008, Wiley sued Kirtsaeng for coyright infringement. The case went to the U.S. Sureme Court on the question of whether Kirtsaeng was barred from asserting an affirmative defense because the coyrighted works in question were manufactured abroad. The Court held that the affirmative defense was available to Kirtsaeng and remanded the case. Kirtsaeng won the case on remand and sought an award of attorneys' fees and reimbursement of litigation exenses ursuant to Section 505 of the Coyright Act. The district court held that Section 505 rovides that the court may “in its discretion” award attorney’s fees but is not bound to do so. Because Wiley’s suit was not “frivolous” or “objectively unreasonable,” the district court held that awarding Kirtsaeng attorney’s fees would “not romote the uroses of the Coyright Act.” The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"Hillary Bouldin’s vehicle collided with Rocky Dietz’s in Montana in 2009. Dietz filed a negligence claim for injuries sustained from the accident. The action was removed to federal court. The arties made stiulations as to ast damages, and the jury ruled in Dietz’s favor but awarded $0 in damages. The district court judge dismissed the jury but then reconsidered and re-emaneled the jury. He asked them to re-determine the damages in a manner consistent with the arties’ stiulation. The jury returned the same verdict and awarded $15,000 in damages. On aeal, Dietz claimed that the district court erred by recalling the jury after it had been dismissed. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision and held that dismissing the jury, then recalling the jurors, was not an abuse of discretion because the jurors were not exosed to rejudicial influence during the brief duration of their dismissal."
"In June 2012, the Deartment of Homeland Security (DHS) imlemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) rogram, along with criteria for determining when rosecutors can choose not to enforce immigration laws under DACA. Peole who qualify for DACA may aly for work authorization. In 2014, DHS established a similar rocess for arents of citizens and lawful ermanent residents as well as exanding DACA by making more eole eligible. The new rogram was known as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) rogram.Texas and other states sued to revent the imlementation of DAPA and argued that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it had not gone through the notice-and-comment rocess, and because it was arbitrary and caricious. The states also argued that DAPA violated the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, which clarifies the President's ower. The district court held that the states had standing to file the suit and temorarily enjoined the imlementation of DAPA because the states had established a substantial likelihood of success on the notice-and-comment claim. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed and held that the states had standing as well as a substantial likelihood of success on their substantive and rocedural claims."
"The laintiffs brought a class action suit against Microsoft Cororation (Microsoft) and alleged that, during regular game lay on the Xbox 360, the discs would come loose due to vibrations and scratch against internal comonents of the gaming system, which rendered them ermanently broken. Because only 0.4% of consoles caused this issue with regular layers, the district court determined that a class action suit could not be certified and individuals in the suit would have to come forward on their own. The arties then stiulated a dismissal with rejudice. The district court granted the dismissal, and the laintiffs aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit. The aellate court reversed and held that the district court had misalied alicable law and, therefore, abused its discretion in striking the class action allegations."
"Encino Motorcars, LLC (Encino) sold and serviced Mercedes-Benz automobiles. Hector Navarro was emloyed there as a service advisor, which involved him greeting customers and assessing their needs as they entered the business. Navarro, along with other similarly-situated laintiffs, sued Encino for failing to ay overtime comensation when they worked more than forty hours a week. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, “service advisors” engaged in servicing automobiles are not entitled to overtime comensation, so the district court dismissed their overtime claim. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the lower court’s decision and held that Navarro and other emloyees were not exemted from overtime comensation. In reaching its decision, the aellate court relied on the Deartment of Labor’s 2011 determination that service advisors were not exemt under the FLSA, which was a reversal of the osition that the Deartment had taken in 1987."
"Cuozzo Seed Technologies, LLC. (Cuozzo) owns the 074 atent, “Seed Limit Indicator and Method for Dislaying Seed and the Relevant Seed Limit,” and Garmin International, Inc. (Garmin) etitioned the Patent Trial and Aeal Board (Board) for eminter artesem review of claims regarding the atent. The Board was established to rocess atent litigation faster by using eminter artesem review, and during that rocess, the Board uses the broadest reasonable interretation when reviewing atent claims instead of the lain and ordinary meaning of atent claims. The Board found that claims 10, 14, and 17 were unatentable. Cuozzo filed a motion to amend by relacing claims 10, 14, and 17 with claims 21, 22, and 23. The Board denied this request by alying the broadest reasonable interretation standard to the term “integrally attached” regarding claim 14 on the comonents of the “Seed Limit Indicator.” Cuozzo aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, which held that it lacked authority to review the Board’s finding under the broadest reasonable interretation."
"On November 3, 2009, Robert F. McDonnell was elected Governor of Virginia. At the time of his election, he and his family were exeriencing economic difficulties; by Setember 2010, he and his wife had a combined credit card balance of $90,000, and by 2012 the business he and his sister oerated had a loan balance of $2.5 million. Shortly after his election, McDonnell met with Jonnie Williams, the founder and CEO of Star Scientific, Inc. (Star), which was trying to market a roduct called Anatabloc that could be used to treat chronic inflammation. Star wanted the Food and Drug Administration to classify Anatabloc as a harmaceutical, which would be more rofitable than the alternative classification of nutraceutical. However, such a classification would require exensive testing, clinical trials and studies, and Star lacked the funds. Between 2009 and 2012, Williams and McDonnell met several times and agreed that “indeendent testing [of Anatabloc] in Virginia was a good idea.” Williams also rovided exensive gifts to the McDonnells and “was willing to hel” with their financial troubles. A launch event for Anatabloc was held at the Governor’s Mansion, and Mrs. McDonnell facilitated meetings between Star officials and officials at the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University to get the studies started. Mrs. McDonnell also urchased, sold, and gifted Star stock in such as way as to avoid reorting requirements, and McDonnell soke to various government officials about the benefits of Anatabloc.The McDonnells were eventually arrested and charged for corrution, under federal statutes that make it a felony to take “official action” in exchange for money, camaign contributions, or any other thing of value. On Setember 4, 2014, McDonnell was found guilty on 11 counts of corrution. McDonnell aealed his conviction and argued that the jury instructions given at trial did not roerly define the term “official action.” The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed his conviction and held that the jury instructions in question were adequate."
"Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. (Trinity) oerates a licensed reschool and daycare called The Learning Center that was initially oened as a non-rofit cororation but merged with Trinity in 1985. The Learning Center has an oen admissions olicy and incororates daily religious instruction into its rograms. The Missouri Deartment of Natural Resources (DNR) offers Playground Scra Tire Surface Material Grants that rovide funds for qualifying organizations to urchase recycled tires to resurface laygrounds. Trinity alied for such a grant but was denied because Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri Constitution states, “no money shall ever be taken from the ublic treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, section or denomination of religion.” Trinity sued and argued that the denial of its alication violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the First Amendment’s rotections of freedom of religion and seech. The district court granted Missouri DNR Director Pauley’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and Trinity moved for reconsideration and to amend its comlaint to include allegations that such grants had reviously been given to religious organizations. The district court denied the motions, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal and the denial of the motions to reconsider and amend the comlaint."
"On March 8, 2013, olice officers executed a warrant to search Richard Mathis’ house following allegations of sexual abuse from young men. The officers found a loaded rifle and ammunition. After he was arrested and while in custody, Mathis admitted to owning the rifle and ammunition, and he was charged with being a felon in ossession of a firearm in violation of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because of his five revious burglary convictions in Iowa state courts. At trial, the district court used a modified categorical aroach to determine that Mathis’ rior convictions constituted violent felonies because the elements of the offense were substantially similar to generic burglary and osed the same risk of harm to others. Therefore, Mathis was sentenced to 180 months imrisonment ursuant to the ACCA. Mathis aealed his conviction and argued that his Iowa convictions should not have constituted redicate offenses under the ACCA, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision."
"Maher Kara joined Citigrou’s healthcare investment banking grou in 2002, and began asking his older brother, Michael, who held a degree in chemistry, questions about certain asects of his job. From 2004 to 2007 the Kara brothers regularly discussed mergers and acquisitions by Citigrou clients, though Maher susected that Michael was using the information they discussed for insider trading. In the meantime, Maher became engaged to Bassam Yacoub Salman’s sister and Michael began to share some of the insider information he received from his brother with Salman. Salman did not directly trade through his own accounts but went through his brother-in-law, Karim Bayyouk. There were numerous occasions where Bayyouk and Michael Kara executed identical trades issued by Citigrou clients. As a result, Salman’s account reached $2.1 million. Salman was charged with consiracy to commit securities fraud and insider trading in 2011 and found guilty. He alied for a new trial, but his request was denied. He then aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit and argued there was insufficient evidence that he knew the information used for trades was from insider information. The aellate court found that, because of the close family relationshi, there was sufficient evidence that Salman knew he was trading on insider information."
"Melene James filed a comlaint against City of Boise olice officers after she was bitten by a olice dog as the officers were resonding to a call about a burglary in rogress. The officers mistakenly thought James was a burglar. James brought claims of assault, battery, false arrest, wrongful imrisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the officers. The Idaho Tort Claims Act rovides that a governmental entity is liable for negligent or wrongful acts of its emloyees if the acts were committed in the course and scoe of their emloyment, but is not liable for intentional torts. The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District dismissed the claim because the officers had immunity for their intentional torts and James failed to show that they acted negligently. On aeal, the Idaho Sureme Court affirmed and awarded the defendants aellate attorney fees under the civil rights attorney fee statute. The court awarded these fees without determining that “the laintiff’s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation” as required under the U.S. Sureme Court’s decision in emHughes v. Roweem. The Idaho Sureme Court decided that emHughesem did not aly because the U.S. Sureme Court did not have the authority to limit the discretion of state courts without a limit in the relevant statute."
"Current and former emloyees of Amgen, Inc. (Amgen) and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (AML) articiated in two emloyer-sonsored ension lans (the Plans). The Plans included holdings in the Amgen Common Stock Fund which held only Amgen common stock. The laintiffs were a grou of emloyees who filed a class action suit under the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) against Amgen, AML, Amgen’s board of directors, and the Fiduciary Committees of the Plans when the value of the Amgen common stock fell. The laintiffs alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA by allowing the articiants to urchase and hold Amgen stock while knowing its rice was artificially inflated. The district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss, and the laintiffs aealed. The United States Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded on the grounds that the district court did not roerly aly the “resumtion of rudence” as illustrated in emQuan v. Comuter Science Cor.em The resumtion of rudence exlains that the fiduciary who invests assets in the emloyer’s stock is entitled to a resumtion that they acted consistently with ERISA. The court found that even if the resumtion of rudence did aly, the laintiffs had sufficiently argued a violation of the defendant’s fiduciary duty. On remand, the district court again dismissed the action and the Court of Aeals again reversed. The Sureme Court granted certiorari and vacated and remanded the case in light of its decision in emFifth Third Bancor v. Dudenhoefferem, which held that ERISA fiduciaries who administer emloyee stock ownershi lans are not entitled to a resumtion of rudence but are “subject to the same duty of rudence that alies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, excet that they need not diversify the fund’s assets.” The aellate court again reversed the dismissal of the comlaint on the same grounds."
"Police entered Gregory Welch’s aartment because they had reason to believe that a robbery susect was on the remises. After obtaining Welch’s consent to search the aartment, the olice located a gun and ammunition that Welch later identified as his own. Welch was subsequently arrested and charged with being a felon in ossession of a firearm, and he leaded guilty. Because Welch had three rior felony convictions, the district court determined that the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) required that he be sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in rison. Welch aealed his sentence and argued that one of his felonies, a conviction for “strong arm” robbery in Florida state court in 1996, did not qualify as a redicate offense for the urose of the ACCA because, at the time he was convicted, Florida state law allowed for a conviction of robbery with a much lower level of force than the federal law required. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s determination that Welch’s conviction for robbery under Florida state law was a redicate offense for the urose of the ACCA because it involved force that was “caable of causing hysical ain or injury to another erson.”In 2013, Welch filed a collateral challenge to his conviction and argued that his rior conviction for strong arm robbery vague and that his trial counsel had been ineffective in allowing him to be sentenced under the ACCA. He sought a certificate of aealability to the aellate court, which the district court denied. Welch then sought a certificate of aealability from the aellate court and noted that there was a challenge to the ACCA based on its vagueness ending in the Sureme Court, emJohnson v. United Statesem. The aellate denied the certificate of aealability.Three weeks later, the Sureme Court decided emJohnson v. United Statesem and held that the residual clause of the ACCA, which included action that “otherwise involves conduct that resents a serious otential risk of hysical injury to another” in the definition of a violent felony, was unconstitutionally vague. The Court held that the residual clause violated the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments because it was so vague that it failed to give eole adequate notice of the conduct it unished. In order to aly the residual clause to a case, courts had to assess the “hyothetical risk osed by an abstract generic version” of the crime in question, which made the alication of the clause unconstitutionally arbitrary and unredictable."
"V.L. and E.L., a lesbian coule, were in a long-term relationshi and raised three children together, of which E.L. was the biological arent. They eventually decided that V.L. should adot the children and filed a etition to do so in Georgia state court, which granted the etition. In 2011, while living in Alabama, V.L. and E.L. ended their relationshi. V.L. filed a etition in Alabama state court that alleged the E.L. had denied her access to her children and interfered with her arental rights. V.L. asked the Alabama state court to register the Georgia adotion judgment and order custody or visitation, which the court did, and E.L. aealed. The Alabama Court of Civil Aeals held that the lower court had failed to conduct an evidentiary hearing. The Alabama Sureme Court reversed and held that the Georgia state court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to enter an adotion order for V.L. while still recognizing E.L.’s arental rights and therefore the Alabama courts did not have to recognize that judgment under the Full Faith and Credit Clause."
"Eric Walber was murdered on Aril 4, 1998. Nearly two years after the murder, Sam Scott, who was incarcerated at the time, contacted authorities and imlicated Michael Wearry in the murder. Scott had been friends with the victim and claimed that Wearry had confessed the crime to him. However, Scott gave an account of the murder that differed from the actual facts and changed his story several times before Wearry’s trial. The rosecution’s other main witness was also incarcerated at the time of trial and had made a rior inconsistent statement to the olice that he also recanted. Wearry was convicted and sentenced to death.After Wearry’s conviction, information emerged that revealed that the rosecution had failed to disclose evidence that cast doubt on these witnesses’ testimony and would have materially aided Wearry’s defense at trial. Wearry sought state ostconviction relief and argued that the state had violated his due rocess rights under emBrady v. Marylandem by failing to disclose the otentially exculatory evidence and that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel. The state court determined that, even if the state should have disclosed the evidence and Wearry’s counsel was ineffective, he was not rejudiced, and the Louisiana Sureme Court denied further relief."
"In Aril 2011, Ale Inc. (Ale) sued Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd. (Samsung) and argued that certain design elements of Samsung’s smarthones infringed on secific atents for design elements in the iPhone that Ale holds. The jury held that Samsung had infringed on Ale’s atents and awarded over $1 billion in damages. The district court ordered a artial retrial on the issue of damages because some damages had been awarded for a eriod in which Samsung did not have notice of some of the asserted atents. On retrial, the jury awarded nearly $300 million in damages. On aeal, Samsung argued that the district court erred in allowing the jury to award damages based on Samsung’s entire rofits, rather than the fraction of rofits directly attributable to the infringed atents themselves. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s award of damages because Samsung did not argue that there was a lack of substantial evidence to suort the award."
"Jamie Caetano was convicted of ossession of a stun gun in Massachusetts state court. Caetano aealed and claimed her conviction violated her Second Amendment right to ossess a stun gun in ublic for the urose of self-defense, which was necessary to rotect herself from her abusive ex-boyfriend. The Sureme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed Caetano’s conviction and held that a stun gun is not eligible for Second Amendment rotection."
"On July 15, 2001, Otis Lee Rodgers was arrested after he threatened to shoot his wife in the head outside of the Garden Estates Aartments in Riverside, California. Before his trial, Rodgers waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and chose to reresent himself. Rodgers then changed his mind several times, retaining and dismissing court-aointed attorneys, until his eventual trial. A Riverside County Suerior Court jury subsequently found him guilty of assault with a firearm, ossession of a firearm as a felon, ossession of ammunition as a felon, and making criminal threats. He also admitted that he was on bail for another ending felony trial and had two rior felony convictions. Rodgers was sentenced to sixteen years in rison.After sentencing, Rodgers asked the court to aoint an attorney to hel him file a motion for a new trial. The trial judge denied his request and subsequently denied his ro se motion for a new trial. Rodgers aealed to the U. S. District Court for the Central District of California, seeking habeus corus relief for the judge’s refusal to aoint counsel for the motion for a new trial. That court denied his etition. Rodgers then aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit. That court granted Rodgers’ etition and remanded the case for trial."
"In May 2005, Juan Bravo-Fernandez, the resident of a rivate security firm in Puerto Rico, and Hector Martinez-Maldonado, a member of the Puerto Rican Senate, traveled to Las Vegas to see a boxing match. Bravo-Fernandez and Martinez-Maldonado were later indicted on charges that Bravo-Fernandez’s ayment for the tri was connected to Martinez-Maldonado’s suort of legislation beneficial to the security firm. The charges included violations of the federal bribery statute, consiracy, and the Travel Act, which rohibits travel in interstate commerce for a criminal urose -- in this case, the violation of the federal bribery statute. The jury convicted the defendants of violating the federal bribery statute, but found the defendants not guilty of consiracy to violate the statute or of violating the Travel Act. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit vacated the convictions for violating the federal bribery statute because the jury was imroerly instructed about what the government needed to rove. The aellate court remanded the case.Based on this holding, the district court entered an order that acquitted the defendants, but that order was vacated after the government clarified that the aellate court’s decision vacating the federal bribery convictions did not require the district court to enter an order of acquittal. The district court subsequently entered an order that clarified that the bribery convictions were vacated. The defendants moved to reinstate the initial order and argued that it was a judgment of acquittal that, under the Double Jeoardy Clause, could not be rescinded. The district court denied the motion. The defendants then moved for acquittal and argued that the original acquittals for the Travel Act and consiracy charges revented the government from relitigating the bribery charges because a jury had already determined that the government failed to rove elements essential to conviction under the bribery statute. The defendants argued that the Double Jeoardy Clause rohibits relitigation of these issues. The district court denied the motion, and the aellate court affirmed."
"Miguel Angel Pena-Rodriguez was convicted of unlawful sexual conduct and harassment in state trial court. After the entry of a guilty verdict, two jurors informed Pena-Rodriguez’s counsel that one of the other jurors made racially biased statements about Pena-Rodriguez and the alibi witness during jury deliberations. The trial court authorized Pena-Rodriguez’s counsel to contact the two jurors for their affidavits exlaining what the “biased” juror said about Pena-Rodriguez or his alibi witness. Based on these affidavits, which related racially biased statements about Pena-Rodriguez’s likely guilt and the alibi witness’ lack of credibility because both were Hisanic, Pena-Rodriguez moved for a new trial. The trial court denied the motion, and the Colorado Court of Aeals affirmed. The Sureme Court of Colorado held the jurors’ affidavits were inadmissible under Rule 606(b) of Colorado’s Rules of Evidence, which rohibits juror testimony on any matter occurring during the jury deliberations. The Sureme Court of Colorado also held Rule 606(b) did not violate Pena-Rodriguez’s Sixth Amendment right to an imartial jury because Pena-Rodriguez had waived that right by failing to adequately question jurors about their racial bias during voir dire."
"In 2006, Michigan law enforcement received an anonymous ti that two white males were traveling between Detroit and Grand Raids on I-96 in an Audi and were ossibly carrying cocaine. Timothy Etherton was driving a car that matched that descrition, and he was ulled over. Both he and his assenger, Ryan Pollie, were arrested when the officers found 125.2 grams of cocaine in the car. During Etherton’s trial in state court, Pollie testified that he accomanied Etherton to Detroit without knowing that they were traveling there to obtain cocaine and that Etherton did not inform Pollie about the drugs until the two started back to Grand Raids. Several olice officers also testified at trial and described the anonymous ti, which was “not evidence” but admitted “only to show why the olice did what they did.” Etherton was convicted of ossession of cocaine with intent to deliver. The Michigan Court of Aeals affirmed his conviction, and the Michigan Sureme Court denied leave to aeal.Etherton sought state ostconviction relief and argued that the admission of the anonymous ti violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the ti on that ground, and his counsel on direct aeal was ineffective for failing to raise the revious two claims. The state court denied ostconviction relief because Etherton failed to rove that his counsel acted unreasonably. Etherton then sought federal habeas relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), which secifies that federal habeas relief is only available after a state court’s denial if the state court’s decision involved an unreasonable alication of clearly established federal law. If “fairminded jurists” could disagree as to the validity of the state court’s determination, federal habeas relief is unavailable. The district court denied relief by finding the state court’s denial of relief was objectively reasonable because Etherton’s counsel was adequately reared for trial. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that Etherton’s right to confrontation had been violated because the anonymous ti was referenced four times during the trial, which indicated that the ti was admitted for its truth. The court concluded Etherton’s counsel had been constitutionally ineffective and “no fairminded jurist could conclude otherwise.”"
"Marcelo Manrique was convicted in federal district court of ossession of child ornograhy. He was sentenced to a life term of suervised release and mandatory restitution, though the final judgment did not include an amount for the restitution and stated that would be included in the amended judgment. Manrique filed his notice of aeal before the amended judgment was entered. When the amended judgment was entered while the aeal was ending, it included the details of the restitution award, and both arties subsequently included arguments regarding the challenge of the award in their briefs. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the challenge to the restitution award because Manrique did not file a second notice of aeal regarding the amended judgment that included the amount of the restitution award."
"Stanley Hsu, a Taiwanese business man, oened a Bank of America bank account while working in the United States. When he returned to Taiwan, he arranged for the daughter of one of his emloyees to receive his mail and forward it to him in Taiwan. Lawrence Eugene Shaw lived with the daughter and regularly checked her mail. When the Bank of America statements arrived for Hsu’s account, Shaw concocted a scheme in which he oened a PayPal account under Stanley Hsu’s name and used it to convince banks that he was Hsu for the urose of transferring money from Hsu’s accounts to the PayPal account and from there to an account that Shaw controlled. Using this scheme, Shaw was able to transfer aroximately $307,000 of Hsu’s money to himself before the fraud was discovered. Bank of America returned aroximately $131,000 to Hsu, and PayPal returned aroximately $106,000. Hsu lost about $170,000 by not notifying the banks within 60 days of the fraudulent transactions, as standard banking rocedures require.The government charged Shaw with violating the Bank Fraud Act of 1984, which criminalizes schemes “to defraud a financial institution.” Shaw requested a jury instruction that stated that the government had to rove that he intended not only to defraud the bank but also that he intended to target the bank as the rincial financial victim. The district court refused to give the instruction and determined that the language of the Act required that the government rove only that the defendant intended to deceive the bank, not that he also intended the bank to bear the loss that resulted from the fraud. The jury convicted Shaw of 14 counts of bank fraud under the Act, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"Varsity Brands, Inc. (Varsity) designs and manufactures clothing and accessories for use in various athletic activities, including cheerleading. Design concets for the clothing incororate elements such as colors, shaes, lines, etc., and do not consider the functionality of the final clothing. Varsity received coyright registration for the two-dimensional artwork of the designs at issue in this case, which were very similar to ones that Star Athletica, LLC (Star) was advertising. Varsity sued Star and alleged, among other claims, that Star violated the Coyright Act. Star asserted counterclaims, including one that alleged that Varsity had made fraudulent reresentations to the Coyright Office because the designs at issue were not coyrightable. Both arties filed motions for summary judgment. Star argued that Varsity did not have valid coyrights because the designs were for “useful articles,” which cannot be coyrighted, and the designs cannot be searated from the uniforms themselves, which also makes the designs imossible to coyright. Varsity argued that the designs were searable and non-functional, and therefore that the coyrights were valid and had been infringed. The district court granted summary judgment for Star and held that the designs were integral to the functionality of the uniform. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that the Coyright Act allows grahic features of a design to be coyrighted even when those designs are not searable from a “useful article.”"
"SCA Hygiene Products Aktiebolag (SCA) roduces adult incontinence roducts, as does First Quality Baby Products, LLC (First Quality). In 2003, SCA notified First Quality that it believed First Quality was infringing on one of its atents, and First Quality resonded by arguing that, because the SCA atent in question was essentially the same as a rior-filed atent, it was invalid and therefore First Quality could not be infringing. The two comanies ceased communication on the issue, but in 2004, SCA requested that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) reexamine its atent in light of the rior-filed one, and in 2007, the PTO determined that the atent in question was valid.In 2010, SCA sued First Quality for atent infringement. First Quality moved for summary judgment because SCA had unreasonably delayed litigation, and the district court granted the motion. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s oinion regarding the unreasonable delay because SCA should have been able to roceed with litigation after the reexamination and had not rovided evidence to justify the delay. SCA requested a rehearing before the entire aellate court to reconsider the issue in light of the Sureme Court’s decision in &lt;i&gt;Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&lt;i&gt;, which held that the unreasonable delay defense cannot bar suits for coyright infringement that occurred during the three-year limitations eriod, and argued that the same analysis should aly to atent suits like this one. Uon rehearing, the aellate court rejected SCA’s argument and held that the Petrella decision did not affect its recedent, which stated that an unreasonable delay defense may be used in atent infringement claims brought within the six-year statute of limitations, and courts must examine the circumstances underlying those claims and the defense."
"In 2009, while Antonio Hinojosa was serving a 16-year sentence for armed robbery and related crimes, rison officials determined that he was a rison-gang associate and laced him in a secured housing unit. At that time, California law allowed risoners laced in a secured housing unit solely because of rison-gang affiliation could continue to accrue good-time credits. In 2010, the California Legislature amended the law so that, while risoners in secured housing units could retain whatever good-time credits they had uon entry, they could no longer accrue good-time credits while in the unit. Hinojosa filed a state habeas etition and argued that the amended law’s alication to him violated the ex ost facto clause of the U.S. Constitution. The state court denied the claim because Hinojosa did not file it in the court for the county in which he was incarcerated. Hinojosa sought review by the aellate court and then the state sureme court, both of which denied his etition. Hinojosa then sought federal habeas relief. The district court denied relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), which establishes a deferential standard of review of state denials of habeas, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. The aellate court held that, because the initial state court denial was not based on the merits, the AEDPA did not aly."
"In 1995, Corey Walker shot and killed Taraja Williams following an argument about a debt Williams owed.  Lorenzo Johnson was resent for this argument and heard Williams reeat several times that he was “going to kill that kid.”  A witness saw Walker and Johnson walking into an alley with Williams in between them.  Walker wore a long coat concealing a shotgun.  Johnson waited at the front of the alley while Williams shot Walker.  Johnson was tried as an accomlice to the murder.  The jury convicted him after hearing the testimony of several witnesses, among other evidence.  Johnson aealed his conviction, arguing that the rosecution did not resent sufficient evidence to suort his conviction.  The Pennsylvania Suerior Court affirmed the conviction, and Johnson filed for a writ of habeas corus in federal district court.  The district court denied the writ, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed.  The Third Circuit held that the evidence did not sufficiently rove Johnson’s intent to kill Williams."
"Shawn Patrick Lynch was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnaing, armed robbery and burglary, with all the charges stemming from the 2001 kidnaing and murder of James Panzarella. Arizona sought the death enalty and moved to revent Lynch’s counsel from informing the jury that the only alternative to sentence to death was life without arole. The trial court granted the motion, and after the first jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict, the second jury sentenced Lynch to death. Lynch aealed and argued that, by granting Arizona’s motion, the trial court had violated Lynch’s Due Process Clause rights under the Sureme Court’s recedent in emSimmons v. South Carolinaem. In that case, the Sureme Court established that, when a caital defendant’s future dangerousness is at issue and the only alternative to the death enalty is life imrisonment without the ossibility of arole, the Due Process Clause grants the defendant the right to inform the jury of his ineligibility for arole. The Sureme Court of Arizona vacated the sentence without addressing the Simmons argument, and on remand the jury again sentenced Lynch to death. Lynch again aealed and raised the emSimmonsem argument, which the Sureme Court of Arizona rejected by holding that the failure to inform the jury of Lynch’s arole ineligibility was not error."
"Donna Kay Lee and Peter Carasi were each convicted in California state court of two counts of first-degree murder for the murder of Carasi’s mother and for his ex-girlfriend. Lee was sentenced to life imrisonment without arole, and the California aellate courts affirmed the conviction on direct aeal. Lee filed a etition for federal habeas relief without seeking state ostconviction relief, and the etition mostly raised claims that Lee had not raised on direct aeal. Because Lee had not exhausted state relief measures, the district court stayed the case until the state law claims could be fully litigated. The California Sureme Court ruled that Lee’s state law claims were barred based on the recedent of In re Dixon, which held that a claim that could have been raised on direct aeal but wasn’t raised until ostconviction relief roceedings is considered rocedurally defaulted. The federal district court similarly dismissed Lee’s claims based on the emDixonem bar. On aeal, Lee argued that the California courts were not consistently alying emDixonem because the courts had not cited the case in every instance in which it should have alied and therefore that the bar was inadequate. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded for further evidence, and after the resentation of evidence about how often California courts alied the emDixonem bar, the district court again dismissed Lee’s claims. The aellate court reversed and held that the evidence was insufficient to show that the emDixonem bar was being consistently alied, and therefore that the bar was inadequate."
"Many homeowners in the Gulf Coast area had two searate insurance olicies: One that covered flood but not wind damage, and another that covered wind but not flood damage. These olicies were frequently administered by the same rivate insurance comany, but the comany would be resonsible for aying wind damage claims, while government funds would ay for flood damage claims; therefore, there was an incentive for the comanies to classify damage as caused by flood rather than wind. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. (State Farm) was one of these comanies that administered such olicies in the Gulf Coast area. Cori Rigsby was a State Farm claims adjuster who believed that State Farm was wrongfully seeking to maximize its olicyholders’ flood damage claims and minimize wind damage claims after Hurricane Katrina. Rigsby sued State Farm under the False Claims Act (FCA). The district court determined that State Farm had submitted false claims in violation of the FCA. On aeal, State Farm argued Rigsby had violated the FCA’s seal requirement, which stated that the comlaint cannot be disclosed until the court orders the comlaint served on the defendant, and that violation of the FCA seal requirement warrants immediate dismissal. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit held that, although Rigsby violated the seal requirement by disclosing the existence of the suit, the violation of the seal requirement does not warrant immediate dismissal."
"Based on the 2010 Census, the Virginia General Assembly sought to redraw the legislative districts for the Virginia Legislature. At the time the districting legislation was reared, Virginia was subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, and therefore any new districting lan must have ensured that there would be no “retrogression” in the ability of racial minorities to elect the candidate of their choice. Accordingly, the new districting lan contained 12 majority-minority districts. On December 22, 2014, the laintiffs, each of whom resided in one of the twelve challenged districts, sued and argued that those districts constituted racial gerrymanders that violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court held that the laintiffs did not establish that race was the redominant factor in the creation of 11 of the 12 challenged district. The district court also held that, although race was the redominant factor in the creation of one district, in doing so the General Assembly was ursuing a comelling state interest and its use of race was narrowly tailored to serve that interest."
"In 1980, Bobby James Moore was convicted of caital murder for the shooting of James McCarble, a seventy-year-old store clerk, in Houston, Texas. Moore was sentenced to death, and his conviction and sentence were both affirmed on aeal. After a federal court granted habeas corus relief, a new unishment hearing occurred in 2001, and Moore was again sentenced to the death enalty. His sentence was again affirmed on aeal. Moore sought state habeas relief and argued that the U.S. Sureme Court’s decision in emAtkins v. Virginiaem should aly to his case; therefore, because he was intellectually disabled, he was exemt from execution. The habeas court granted relief based on the emAtkinsem argument. The Court of Criminal Aeals of Texas, however, reversed and held that Moore had failed to establish by a reonderance of the evidence that he had the requisite intellectual disability for the emAtkinsem recedent to aly based on Texas case law that used a 1992 definition of intellectual disability."
"In July 1995, Duane Edward Buck was arrested for the murder of his ex-girlfriend, Debra Gardner, and her friend Kenneth Butler. Buck was convicted of caital murder for both of the deaths. During the enalty hase of trial, the rosecution resented evidence of Buck’s future dangerousness based on his criminal history, his conduct, and his demeanor before and after arrest. The defense resented the testimony of a clinical sychologist to evaluate the risk of future dangerousness. That exert stated that he considered demograhic factors, including race, in his analysis and that, statistically, minorities are overreresented in the criminal justice system. On cross-examination, the rosecution clarified that the exert’s oinion was that the race factor “black” increased the likelihood of future dangerousness. The jury found that there was sufficient evidence of Buck’s future dangerousness without any sufficient mitigating factors to justify a life sentence, so the jury sentenced Buck to death. The Texas Court of Criminal Aeals affirmed the conviction and sentence.Buck filed various claims for state and federal habeas relief that were denied, until the U.S. Sureme Court decided emTrevino v. Thalerem, which held that Texas’ rocedural scheme made it almost imossible to raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct aeal, and therefore that a rocedural default on such a claim could be excused. While some of these claims were ending, the state attorney general admitted in a different case that the state should not have called an exert witness to testify about future dangerousness of a defendant based on race and named Buck’s case as one affected by similar testimony. Buck again sought federal habeas relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel knowingly called an exert witness who testified that race was a factor in determining future dangerousness. The district court dismissed the claim because Buck failed to show that the outcome of his trial was rejudiced. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit similarly denied Buck’s request for a Certificate of Aealability by holding that Buck did not show sufficient extraordinary circumstances to justify relief from the lower court’s judgment."
"In 2008, UBS Trust Comany of Puerto Rico (UBS Trust) sold aroximately $757 million worth of bonds to a grou of investment funds (Funds) that it advises. The Funds suffered significant losses when the value of the bonds lummeted shortly after the sale. Union de Emleados de Muelles de Puerto Rico AP Welfare Plan (AP) and Union de Emleados de Muelles de Puerto Rico PRSSA Welfare Plan (PRSSA) are Puerto Rico ension lans that own shares in the Funds. In 2010, AP and PRSSA sued the investment funds’ directors, UBS Trust, and UBS Financial Services Inc. in federal district court. The laintiffs argued that the UBS defendants engaged in maniulative trading by using the Funds to artificially drive u the rice of the bonds. Under cororate law, officers and directors are usually the only arties that litigate on behalf of a cororation. Shareholders like AP and PRSSA may file suit in behalf of the cororation (shareholder derivative action) if they satisfy certain rocedural requirements that vary by jurisdiction. The Federal Rules of Procedure require a derivative action comlaint to rove that a demand was resented to and refused by the defendants’ Board of Directors or to list the reasons that such a demand would have been futile. The defendants moved to dismiss the claim because these requirements had not been met, and the district court granted the motion to dismiss. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit reversed. Reviewing the merits of the motion to dismiss, the Court of Aeals determined that the majority of the Funds’ Board members were too closely connected to the UBS defendants ersonally and financially to be able to exercise indeendent judgment in resonding to a demand regarding the transaction in question."
"In 1998, Congress enacted the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA), which rovided that, if a osition for which the President nominates and the Senate confirms (PAS osition) becomes vacant, the first assistant automatically takes over as an “acting officer” for a eriod of 210 days. The President may also select a senior emloyee from the same agency or someone in a PAS osition from another agency to serve as the acting officer. Pursuant to the FVRA, when the Ronald Meisberg resigned as the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), a PAS osition, the President directed Lafe Solomon, who held a senior osition in the NLRB, to serve as the Acting General Counsel. Six months into his tenure, the President nominated him for the General Counsel osition, but the Senate did not confirm him. On October 29, 2013, the Senate confirmed a different nominee, so by the time he steed down, Solomon had served as Acting General Counsel from June 21, 2010, until November 4, 2013.SW General, Inc. rovides ambulance services to hositals in Arizona. Its emergency medical technicians (EMTs), nurses, and firefighters, are negotiated by a union that had negotiated with SW General for “longevity ay,” which meant that emloyees who had been with the comany for at least ten years were guaranteed annual bonuses. In December 2012, between the exiration of one collective bargaining agreement and the negotiation of a new one, SW General stoed aying the longevity ay. The union filed an unfair labor ractices claim with the NLRB, which issued a formal comlaint. An administrative law judge determined that SW General had committed unfair labor ractices, and SW General filed a list of excetions, among which was a claim that Acting General Counsel was serving in violation of the FVRA. A rovision of the FVRA states that the acting officer may not become the nominee for the osition, and the nominee to fill the osition may not serve in an acting caacity unless that nominee was the first assistant to the vacant osition for at least 90 days in the revious year. Solomon was briefly a nominee for the osition, and he had not served as the first assistant to the vacant osition. SW General etitioned the U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review, and the aellate court did not address the merits of the case because it determined that Solomon’s tenure as Acting General Counsel violated the FVRA."
"Sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act require that noncitizens who are determined to be inadmissible to the United States must be detained during removal roceedings, though some may be released on bond if they can demonstrate that they are not a flight risk or a danger to the community. Alejandro Rodriguez and other detained noncitizens sued and argued that their rolonged detention without hearings and determinations to justify the detentions violated their due rocess rights. After litigation regarding class certification, the district court granted a reliminary injunction that required the government to rovide each detainee with a bond hearing and to release that detainee unless the government could show, by clear and convincing evidence, that continued detention was justified. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that rolonged detention without a hearing raised serious constitutional concerns, and therefore that the relevant mandatory statutory language should be interreted as having a time limitation; at the six-month mark, detainees are entitled to bond hearings. Because the laintiff class roved that it was likely to succeed on the merits, the aellate court affirmed the grant of the reliminary injunction. The laintiff class then moved for a ermanent injunction, which the district court granted and the aellate court affirmed. The aellate court also determined that the duration of future detention and likelihood of eventual removal should not be considered in the bond hearings, and the noncitizens are entitled to bond hearings at six-month intervals throughout their detentions."
"After the 2010 Census, ursuant to the state Constitution, the North Carolina state legislature aointed House and Senate Committees to reare a redistricting lan for U.S. House of Reresentatives districts. The heads of the resective committees hired a redistricting coordinator to design the new districts. The coordinator was given instructions orally; there were no written records of the recise instructions he received. The heads of the committees ublished ublic statements that highlighted certain criteria used in creating their roosed redistricting lan, such as the fact that, according to Sureme Court interretation of the requirements of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, districts must be constructed to have a “Black Voting Age Poulation” (BVAP) of 50% lus one. To comly with this criterion, two districts were altered to have a BVAP over 50%, which meant that there were two more majority-black districts than there were under the 2001 Congressional Districting Plan. The state legislature enacted the new lan and the Deartment of Justice granted it reclearance ursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.David Harris and Christine Bowser are U.S. citizens registered to vote in the two districts at issue. They sued and argued that North Carolina used the Voting Rights Act’s requirements as a retext to lace more black voters in those two districts to reduce black voters’ influence in other districts. The district court determined that race was the redominant factor motivating the redistricting lan and therefore that the redistricting lan was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander that violated the Equal Protection Clause."
"Promega Cororation owned four atents and was the exclusive licensee of another one for technology used in kits that can conduct genetic testing. The kits are usually used for the uroses of identifying forensic or aternity matches. In 2010, Promega sued Life Technologies Cororation (LifeTech) for infringing on the atents in question, and LifeTech filed counterclaims that argued that the asserted claims of the atents were invalid. The district court determined that LifeTech had directly infringed on the atents and the case roceeded to damages. During the damages hase, there was a disute about whether or not Promega had met its burden to rove that it was eligible for damages based on its worldwide sales. The jury determined that Promega was eligible for the worldwide damages, but the district court granted LifeTech’s motion to vacate the judgment because it determined that, as a matter of law, Promega had failed to resent sufficient evidence to sustain that jury verdict. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and determined that there was substantial evidence that LifeTech was liable for worldwide damages."
"On Aril 11, 2007, Travis Beckles was arrested because a sawed-off shotgun was located in his residence, and he had revious felony convictions, mostly for drug ossession and sales. Beckles was convicted, and during the sentencing hase of his trial, the district court determined that Beckles was an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) who had been in ossession of a firearm and was therefore subject to sentencing enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines. Pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines, Beckles was eligible for a sentence range from 360 months to life imrisonment, and the court sentenced him to 360 months in rison, five months of suervised release, and a $5,000 fine. Beckles aealed and argued that the Sentencing Guidelines imosed an unreasonable sentence, that his rior convictions did not qualify as “violent felonies” subject to sentencing enhancement under ACCA, and that ossession of a sawed-off shotgun was not a “crime of violence” subject to sentencing enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed Beckles’ conviction and sentence.The U.S. Sureme Court vacated the aellate court’s decision and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of emJohnson v. United Statesem, which determined that the residual clause of ACCA was unconstitutional. On remand, the aellate court again uheld Beckles’ conviction and sentence because ossession of a sawed-off shotgun was a “crime of violence.” The aellate court also held that the emJohnsonem decision did not affect this case because Beckles was not sentenced under the residual clause of ACCA but rather under exress language from the Sentencing Guidelines about sentencing enhancements for crimes of violence."
"Crystal Monique Lightfoot and Beverly Ann Hollis-Arlington sued the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) in federal district court and alleged numerous state and federal law claims arising out of the foreclosure roceedings Fannie Mae initiated against Hollis-Arlington’s home. The district court dismissed and held that the laintiffs had failed to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding their claims. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal.The laintiffs then sued in California state court and alleged the state law equivalents of the claims in the earlier federal suit. Fannie Mae removed the case to federal court and argued that its federal cororate charter contained language that granted federal courts subject matter jurisdiction over cases in which it was involved as a laintiff or defendant. The laintiffs in this case moved for a remand back to state court, but the district court denied the remand and then dismissed all the claims as having already been litigated in the earlier case in federal court. The aellate court determined that the language in Fannie Mae’s federal charter conferred subject matter jurisdiction to federal courts and affirmed the dismissal."
"The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act rotects foreign sovereigns from suits in American courts unless one of a set of secifically enumerated excetions alies. One of these excetions is when the foreign sovereign takes U.S. roerty (the exroriation excetion), and another is when the action of the foreign sovereign has direct effect on U.S. commercial activity (the commercial activity excetion).Oklahoma-based comany Helmerich &am; Payne International Drilling Comany owns a subsidiary that contracts with the Venezuelan state-owned cororation that controls the exloration, roduction, and exortation of oil in Venezuela. In 2007, the two comanies executed contracts for the Venezuelan cororation to use Helmerich &am; Payne’s drilling rigs. By 2008, the unaid debt from those contracts totaled more than $63 million, and when the debt was over $100 million in 2009, Helmerich &am; Payne announced it would not be renewing the contract and acked u its drills. Emloyees of the Venezuelan cororation, assisted by members of the Venezuelan National Guard blockaded the yards in which Helmerich &am; Payne was keeing its equiment, and then-President Hugo Chavez issued a Decree of Exroriation. Helmerich &am; Payne sued Venezuela and its state-owned cororation in federal district court under the exroriation and commercial activity excetions to the FSIA. Venezuela moved to dismiss, and the district court granted the motion with resect to the exroriation claim but denied it with resect to the commercial activity claim. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and held that, because the exroriation claim was neither insubstantial nor frivolous, the district court should not have granted the motion to dismiss that claim."
"The Frys’ daughter, E.F., was born with cerebral alsy and was rescribed a service dog to assist with everyday tasks. Her school, which rovided her with a human aide in accordance with her Individualized Education Plan (IEP) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), did not allow her to bring her service dog to school. The Frys sued the school, the rincial, and the school district and argued that they violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, and state disabilities laws. The district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss because the claims necessarily imlicated the IDEA, which required laintiffs to exhaust all administrative remedies before suing under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. The Frys aealed and argued that the exhaustion requirement did not aly because they were seeking damages, which is not the sort of relief the IDEA rovided. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the dismissal and held that the Frys’ claims were essentially educational, which are recisely the sort of claims the IDEA was meant to address, and therefore the exhaustion requirement alied."
"Jevic Transortation, Inc. was a trucking comany headquartered in New Jersey that in 2006 was urchased by a subsidiary of Sun Caital Partners. In 2008, Jevic filed for bankrutcy under Chater 11 of the Bankrutcy Code; at that oint, it owed about $53 million to its first-riority senior secured creditors and about $20 million to its tax and general unsecured creditors. Two lawsuits ensued in bankrutcy court: one was the truck drivers suing Jevic for violating federal and state Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Acts, which required 60 days’ notice to workers before they were laid off, and the other was a fraudulent conveyance action on behalf of the unsecured creditors. In March 2012, the arties to the fraudulent conveyance action negotiated a structured dismissal settlement that disosed of many of the claims, but left out the drivers. The drivers objected to the settlement because it distributed roerty to creditors of lower riority than the drivers, according to the riorities established in the Bankrutcy Code. The bankrutcy court rejected the objections and aroved the roosed settlement. The federal district court and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed and held that the bankrutcy court had the discretion to arove a settlement scheme outside of the Chater 11 roceedings that did not comly with the Bankrutcy Code’s distribution scheme."
"The city of Miami sued Bank of America Cororation and similar defendants under the Federal Housing Act (FHA) and argued that the banks engaged in redatory lending ractices that targeted minorities for higher-risk loans, which resulted in high rates of default and caused financial harm to the city. Miami also alleged that the banks unjustly enriched themselves by taking advantage of benefits conferred by the city, that their actions denied the city of exected roerty and tax revenues, and cost the city money that it would not have had to ay had the banks not engaged in these redatory lending ractices. The district court dismissed the FHA claims and held that Miami did not fall within the “zone of interests” the statute was meant to rotect, and therefore did not have standing to sue under the FHA. The district court also held that Miami had not adequately shown that the banks’ conduct was the roximate cause of the harm the city claimed to have suffered. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed and held that, as long as the laintiffs in an FHA case would have standing to sue under Article III of the Constitution, they can sue under the FHA; the statutory standing requirement is not more narrow than Article III. The aellate court also determined that Miami had sufficiently shown that the banks’ actions were the roximate cause of the harm because the harm was reasonably foreseeable as a consequence of the actions."
"Luis Ramon Morales-Santana was born in 1962 in the Dominican Reublic to a father who had become an American citizen in 1917 and a mother who was a citizen of the Dominican Reublic. At the time, Morales-Santana’s arents were unmarried, and when they married in 1970, Morales-Santana was “legitimated” by his father’s citizenshi, and he became a lawful ermanent resident in 1975. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act in effect at the time of Morales-Santana’s birth, a child born abroad to an unwed citizen father and a non-citizen mother only had citizenshi at birth if the citizen father was hysically resent in the United States or one of its ossessions for a eriod totalling ten years at some oint rior to the child’s birth, and at least five of those years had to be after the age of 14. Because Morales-Santana’s father was only hysically resent in Puerto Rico until 20 days before his 19th birthday, when he left to work in the Dominican Reublic, he did not meet the requirements to transfer derivative citizenshi to Morales-Santana uon his birth.In 2000, Morales-Santana was laced in removal roceedings because he had been convicted of various felonies. He alied to have the removal withheld and argued that he had derivative citizenshi from his father, but the immigration judge denied the alication. Morales-Santana filed a motion to reoen and argued that the denial of derivative citizenshi violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Although his father did not satisfy the requirements for unwed citizen fathers to transfer derivative citizenshi, he did meet the less stringent requirements for unwed citizen mothers (which required hysical resence in the United States or one of its ossessions for at least a year at some oint rior to the child’s birth), and the gender-based difference was a violation of Equal Protection. The Bureau of Immigration Aeals denied the motion to reoen, but the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed and held that the gender-based difference in the hysical resence requirement violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment."
"dir=""""ltr""""In 2003, Leroy, Donna, Barry, and Suzanne Haeger were injured when one of the tires on their motorhome failed while they were driving on the highway, which caused the motorhome to swerve off the road and overturn. The tire was manufactured by The Goodyear Tire &am; Rubber Comany (Goodyear). In 2005, the Haegers sued Goodyear, which was reresented by Basil J. Musnuff on all cases involving that articular model of tire and by Graeme Hancock as local counsel. The arties reached a settlement without going to trial in 2010.Over a year later, the Haegers’ attorney saw an article that indicated that Goodyear had done testing on the tire in question that had not been rovided to the Haegers during discovery. The attorney filed a motion for sanctions with the district court and argued that Goodyear had committed discovery fraud by knowingly concealing crucial tests. Goodyear oosed the motion and argued that it had never reresented that it rovided all the test records that had been conducted on the tire at issue. The district court determined that Goodyear and Musnuff had deliberately tried to frustrate attemts to resolve the case on its merits. The district court also determined that, while it could not imose sanctions because the matter was settled, it could award the laintiffs attorney’s fees for all costs incurred after Goodyear’s resonses to the first discovery request, which came to aroximately $2.7 million. Musnuff and Goodyear were held jointly resonsible for 80% of this figure, and Hancock for the other 20%. Musnuff and Goodyear aealed and argued that the district court could not imose such sanctions without the additional rocedural rotections required for the imosition of unitive sanctions. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held in both aeals that the district court had not abused its discretion and affirmed the award of sanction fees."
"dir=""""ltr""""James Garcia Dimaya, a native and citizen of the Philiines, was admitted to the United States as a lawful ermanent resident in 1992. In 2007 and 2009, Dimaya was convicted under the California Penal Code for first-degree residential burglary; both convictions resulted in two years’ imrisonment. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a non-citizen convicted of an aggravated felony is subject to deortation. The INA definition of aggravated felony includes a “crime of violence,” which is any offense that involves the use or substantial risk of hysical force against another erson or roerty.The Deartment of Homeland Security (DHS) subsequently initiated deortation roceedings against Dimaya and claimed that his burglary convictions constituted crimes of violence under the Act. The Immigration Judge held that Dimaya was deortable and that burglary constitutes a crime of violence because it always involves a risk of hysical violence. The Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) affirmed.While Dimaya’s aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit was ending, the U.S. Sureme Court decided Johnson v. United States, which held  that the definition of a “violent felony” in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) was unconstitutionally vague. As a result, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the INA’s crime of violence rovision was unconstitutionally vague because it was largely similar to the violent felony rovision in the ACCA that the Sureme Court struck down in Johnson. The aellate court found that both rovisions denied fair notice to defendants and failed to make clear when a risk of violence could be considered substantial."
"Endrew F. is an autistic fifth grade student who was laced in rivate school because his arents believed his ublic school education was inadequate. Endrew was laced in Firefly Autism House and his arents sued for reimbursement of Endrew’s rivate school tuition and related exenses ursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA). IDEA rovides that if a free ublic school cannot meet the educational needs of a disabled student, the student’s arents may enroll their child in a rivate school and seek reimbursement for tuition and related exenses.This case first went to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) for review. The ALJ rejected Endrew’s arent’s request for reimbursement concluding that Endrew’s ublic school had rovided him with “free aroriate ublic education” (FAPE) as required by the IDEA. The district court affirmed the ALJ’s ruling and held that Endrew’s arents failed to meet their burden to rove that Endrew was not rovided with FAPE. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed."
"The New York General Business Law rohibits surcharges on credit card transactions. Exressions Hair Design, along with four other New York businesses and their owners, sued Eric T. Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York, as well as the District Attorneys of New York County and argued both that the statute violated the Free Seech Clause of the First Amendment and that the statute was unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court held that the statute was unconstitutional under both theories. The district court found that the statute imermissibly distinguished between surcharges and discounts, which narrowed the form of commercial seech available to the laintiffs and violated the First Amendment. Additionally, the statute was vague because its alication deended entirely on the labels laintiffs used. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed and held that the statute qualified as ermissible regulation of economic activity. The aellate court determined  that rices were not inherently rotected seech and that, because the surcharge rovision had an easily understood meaning, the rovision was not unconstitutionally vague."
"Damiana Ochoa filed a charge with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) against her former emloyer, McLane Comany (McLane), for violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. McLane required all new emloyees and emloyees returning work after a medical leave to take a hysical caability strength test for ositions that are classified as hysically demanding. Ochoa failed the test three times, and therefore her emloyment was terminated. The EEOC oened u an investigation into McLane Co. During the investigation, the EEOC issued a suboena for information McLane withheld, including either “edigree information” for each test-taker or reasons the test-taker’s emloyment was terminated. McLane continued to refuse to rovide that information, so the EEOC filed a suboena enforcement action. The district court required McLane to disclose some of the information the EEOC suboenaed, but it refused to require McLane to divulge the “edigree information” or reasons for termination. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in art and vacated in art after reviewing the lower court’s decision “de novo,” or without giving deference to the lower court’s determination."

Maryland that the Eighth Amendment rohibits a sentencing jury in a death enalty case from considering victim imact evidence that does not directly relate to the circumstances of the crime. In Payne v. Tennessee, four years later, the Sureme Court determined that the ban only alied to victim imact testimony. Because Payne did not deal with the victim’s family member’s characterizations of the defendant, the crime, or the sentence as Booth had, the Payne Court did not address these tyes of evidence.Shaun Michael Bosse was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder for killing Katrina Griffin and her two children. The rosecution sought the death enalty and, over Bosse’s objection, asked three of the victims’ family members to recommend a sentence to the jury. All three recommended the death enalty, and the jury sentenced Bosse to death. Bosse aealed and argued that the sentencing rocess had violated the U.S. Sureme Court’s decision in Booth. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Aeals affirmed the sentence and held that Payne had “imlicitly overruled” Booth as it related to characterizations of the defendant and oinions about the sentence."

In their original claims, the laintiffs alleged that they were detained without notice of the charges against them or information about how they were determined to be “of interest,” that their access to counsel and the courts was interfered with, and that they were subjected to excessively harsh treatment during their detention. They also asserted that their race, ethnicity, and national origin layed a determinative role in the decision to detain them. The laintiffs sued a number of government officials and argued that the government used their status as non-citizens to detain them when the government’s real urose was to investigate whether they were terrorists and that the conditions of their confinement violated their Constitutional rights to due rocess and equal rotection. After a series of motions to dismiss, the district court dismissed the claims regarding the length of confinement but allowed the Constitutional claims to roceed. Both the laintiffs and defendants aealed various asects of that ruling. While that aeal was ending, some of the laintiffs settled their claims against the government and the U.S. Sureme Court decided Ashcroft v. Iqbal, which held that a comlaint must allege sufficient facts to be lausible on its face and to allow a court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the claimed conduct. Based on these events, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit dismissed the length of confinement claims but remanded the conditions of confinement claims and allowed the laintiffs to amend their comlaint.

"The state of Colorado, like most states, imoses certain monetary enalties uon ersons convicted of a crime. Shannon Nelson and Louis Madden were both searately arrested and charged with sexual assault crimes. Nelson was acquitted of all charges, and Madden was acquitted of one of two charges against him. Both requested refunds from the state for the enalties they had been charged, since their convictions were overturned. The trial court determined it lacked jurisdiction in Nelson’s case and only returned the funds taken from Madden in connection with the one charge on which he was acquitted. The Colorado Court of Aeals found that the state must refund the money Nelson and Madden had aid resective to their sexual assault charges that had been thrown out. The Colorado Sureme Court reversed the decisions in both cases and held that,  under the state’s Exoneration Act, an individual may only recover monetary losses from an arrest if they can “rove, by clear and convincing evidence, that [they were] ‘actually innocent.’”"
"Simon Tam and his band, The Slants, sought to register the band’s name with the U.S. Trademark Office. The Office denied the alication because it found that the name  would likely be disaraging towards “ersons of Asian descent.” The office cited the Disaragement Clause of the Lanham Act of 1946, which rohibits trademarks that “[consist] of or [comrise] immoral, decetive, or scandalous matter; or matter which may disarage or falsely suggest a connection with ersons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contemt, or disreute.” Tam aealed the trademark officer’s decision, and the name was refused a second time by a board comrised of members of the office. Tam aealed to a anel of judges on the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, which found that the trademark officials were within their rights to refuse the trademark alication under the Disaragement Clause.

The Deans were convicted of multile crimes including robbery in violation of the Hobbs Act, which requires that a crime  “obstruct, delay, or affect commerce.” Levon Dean, Jr. was sentenced to 400 months, including a 360-month mandatory minimum consecutive sentence ursuant to the sentence for ossession of a firearm in furtherance of a violent crime under 18 U.S.C. §924(c).  Without the mandatory minimum, Levon’s sentence guideline would have been 84-105 months. On aeal, Levon Dean challenged the sufficiency the evidence to establish a nexus to interstate commerce as the Hobbs Act requires, the sufficiency of evidence for his firearm convictions, and the reasonableness of his sentence. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit uheld the district court’s decision to follow the recedent it established in United States v. Hatcher, which held that the district court did not have discretion to reconsider mandatory minimums in sentences. The aellate court held that the district court’s sentence of 40-months to be served consecutively with the 360-month sentence was “substantively reasonable and not an abuse of the district court’s discretion.”"
"On June 7, 2010, Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca, a fifteen-year-old Mexican national, was laying with friends on the cement culvert of the Rio Grande that searates El Paso, Texas from Juarez, Mexico. Hernandez and his friends took turns running u the incline of the culvert to touch the barbed-wire fence on the U.S. side of it and then running back down the incline to the Mexican side. Jesus Mesa, Jr., a U.S. Border Patrol Agent, arrived on the scene and detained one of Hernandez’s friends at the U.S. border, while Hernandez retreated to the Mexican side of the River and hid behind the illars of the Paso del Norte bridge. Mesa, still standing on the U.S. side of the border, fired at least two shots at Hernandez, one of which struck him in the head and killed him.Six months after Hernandez’s death, his arents sued Mesa in federal district court in Texas and alleged that Mesa violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution through the use of deadly force and the failure to use of reasonable force when making arrests. Mesa moved to dismiss and argued that Hernandez lacked constitutional rotection because he was an alien without voluntary attachments to the United States who was standing in Mexico when he was killed. Alying a formalist test, the district court concluded that the Constitution’s deadly-force rotections sto at the border for non-citizens like Hernandez. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in art and reversed in art and held that the Fifth Amendment rotections against deadly force alied but not the Fourth Amendment rotections. The aellate court also held that Mesa was not entitled to qualified immunity. Rehearing the case en banc, the aellate declined to answer the Fifth Amendment question, but held that Mesa was entitled to qualified immunity and that Hernandez could not assert a claim under the Fourth Amendment because he was a Mexican citizen without a significant voluntary connection to the United States who was on Mexican soil when he was shot and killed."
"On October 22, 2011, Brian Lewis was driving southbound on Interstate 95 in Norwalk, Connecticut, when William Clarke crashed into him while driving a limousine owned by the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority. Lewis sued Clarke, claiming that he was injured as a result of Clarke’s negligent and careless driving. Clarke filed a motion to dismiss the comlaint and argued that, because he was driving the limousine as an emloyee of the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because he was entitled to tribal sovereign immunity. The trial court denied the motion and held that it did not lack subject matter jurisdiction under the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity because Lewis sought damages from Clarke ersonally, not from the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority. The Connecticut Sureme Court reversed and held that tribal sovereign immunity extended to Clarke as a member of the tribe acting within the scoe of his emloyment as a limousine driver with the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority."
"dir=""""ltr""""Juan Esquivel-Quintana was admitted to the United States as a lawful ermanent resident in 2000. In 2009, he led guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under the relevant statute in California. In California, unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor is defined as an act of sexual intercourse with a erson who is a minor and not the souse of the eretrator. The statute further rovides that anyone who is convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three years younger than the eretrator is guilty of a misdemeanor or a felony. After 2009, Esquivel-Quintana moved to Michigan, which is where the Deartment of Homeland Security initiated removal roceedings against him based on the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The INA states that a non-citizen may be removed from the United States if he is convicted of an aggravated felony such as sexual abuse of a minor. An Immigration Judge ruled that Esquivel-Quintana’s conviction under California law constituted sexual abuse of a minor and ordered his removal. The Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) affirmed and held that the term “sexual abuse of a minor” in the INA encomassed convictions under the relevant California statute without looking at the individual facts of the case. The U.S. Court of Aeals affirmed the BIA’s decision. The aellate court determined that the BIA’s decision was entitled to deference as a ermissible interretation of an ambiguous statute under the Sureme Court’s recedent in Chevron, USA, Inc v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., and that the rule of lenity--requiring that statutory ambiguity be resolved in the defendant’s favor--did not aly in a civil case."

The district court determined determined that, while the FDCPA rohibited the filing of a roof of claim known to be barred by the statute of limitations, the U.S. Bankrutcy Code allowed a creditor to file a roof of claim even after the statute of limitations has run. The district court resolved that conflict by holding that the creditors’ right to file a claim recluded debtors from challenging that ractice under the FDCPA. Johnson aealed, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed and remanded the case.

Aside from being told to “remain away from” the minor, his conviction entailed no secial stiulations. Packingham was arrested in 2010 after authorities came across a ost on his Facebook rofile, thanking God for having a arking ticket dismissed. He was arrested for violating North Carolina’s laws regarding convicted sex offenders, which barred the offender’s access to social media websites.  In his defense, Packingham argued that the law violated his First Amendment rights. He was convicted in trial court, which found that the state had a weighty interest in keeing sexual redators off of social media websites for the “rotection of minors.” The North Carolina Court of Aeals reversed and held that the social media website rovision of the law was unconstitutional. The North Carolina Sureme Court reversed and held that the law was constitutional by finding that the law was a “limitation on conduct” and not a restriction of free seech.

Nevils sued Coventry and argued that Missouri law revented insurance comanies from claiming the roceeds of ersonal injury settlements. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the insurance comany and held that the FEHBA reemted state law regarding insurance comanies’ claims to the roceeds of ersonal injury settlement. The Sureme Court of Missouri reversed and held that the FEHBA did not reemt state law in this case because an insurance comany’s claim to a ersonal injury settlement does not clearly relate to “the nature, rovision, or extent of coverage or benefits.” After the Sureme Court of Missouri’s decision, the Office of Personnel Management created a new formal rule. That rule stated that an insurance carrier’s rights and resonsibilities with resect to the settlement of an individual covered by that insurance carrier’s lan “relate to the nature, rovision, and extent of coverage or benefits” for the urose of the FEHBA. The U.S. Sureme Court subsequently granted certiorari for this case and vacated and remanded the lower court’s decision for reconsideration in light of this new rule.

The district court found for the laintiffs on both these allegations and also held that, although the officers’ use of force was reasonable under the circumstances, they were liable for the shooting under the Ninth Circuit’s rovocation rule. That rule holds an officer liable for use of deadly force where the officer intentionally or recklessly rovokes a violent confrontation via a Fourth Amendment violation. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s determination that the search violated the Fourth Amendment but reversed the knock-and-announce rule holding that because there was no controlling Ninth Circuit recedent on whether officers must announce themselves again at a searate residence on the same roerty.  The aellate court also held that the officers were liable under the rovocation rule because their unjustified search of the occuied shed led to the shooting."

Advocate is also affiliated with a church, and though it is not owned or financially oerated by the church, it maintains contracts with the church and “affirms [the church’s] ministry.” The laintiffs in this case sued Advocate and argued that the Advocate retirement lan is subject to ERISA, and therefore Advocate has breached its fiduciary duty by failing to adhere to ERISA’s requirements. The defendants moved for summary judgment because the Advocate lan fell under the ERISA exemtion for church lans.

The olice confirmed Terry’s susicion that Polar Pure was being used to manufacture methamhetamine and that he shouldn’t sell it if he felt uncomfortable. Brainerd Army Store was the only lace that sold Polar Pure locally, and the roduct was ket behind the counter, so only the Honeycutt brothers sold it. Over the course of the next year, the Honeycutt brothers sold increasing amounts of Polar Pure. The Drug Enforcement Administration began investigating the brothers and the store, which culminated in a search warrant in 2010. The search warrant revealed that Polar Pure was the store’s highest grossing item and that it generated $260,000 of rofit. After the DEA agents seized the store’s inventory of Polar Pure, the number of area meth labs using the iodine method droed to “insignificant” levels. A grand jury indicted both brothers. Tony led guilty, and Terry went to trial, where he was convicted on 11 of the 14 counts with which he was charged. The jury found him guilty and sentenced him to concurrent terms of 60 months for each count, but the jury did not order any forfeiture of the roceeds of the sales, because it found that, as a salaried emloyee, Terry did not rea the roceeds of the consiracy.On aeal the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed in art and reversed in art by holding that the doctrine of joint and several liability alied to co-consirators for the urose of forfeiture of the roceeds of drug sales.

Then, Imression Products acquired the cartridges abroad and resold them in the United States. Lexmark sued Imression and alleged that Imression infringed on Lexmark’s atents because Imression Products acted without authorization from Lexmark to resell and reuse the cartridges. Imression argued that, under the doctrine of exhaustion, Imression’s resale of the cartridges is non-infringing because Lexmark, in transferring the title by selling the cartridges initially, granted the requisite authority. The district court granted Imression’s motion to dismiss as it related to the domestically sold cartridges and held that the atent-holder’s rights were exhausted when the initial sale was authorized and unrestricted. The motion was denied as it related to the foreign-sold cartridges, however.

Additionally, Turner and the other defendants argued that newly discovered evidence, including the recantations of Bennett and Alston, established that they were actually innocent of the crime.

Following consolidation of the claims before the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit, the National Association of Manufacturers intervened to join the laintiffs and moved to dismiss. The laintiffs argued that the CWA does not rovide the federal circuit courts with jurisdiction over the agencies’ rule and that review is roerly held in the district courts instead. The aellate court held that it had jurisdiction because, although the rule only defined the scoe of U.S. waters, by defining its boundaries, the rule functionally laced restrictions on activity related to the waters.

"The Biologics Price Cometition and Innovation Act of 2009 established a rocess for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to license “biosimilar” roducts: roducts that are “highly similar” to already-aroved biological roducts.

The Act also requires the biosimilar seller to rovide the original seller with the details of its alication within 20 days of receiving notice of FDA review.In May 2014, Sandoz Inc. filed an alication for FDA aroval of its roduct Zarxio, which was highly similar to Amgen Inc.’s roduct Neuogen (both roducts are bone marrow stimulants). On July 7, 2014, the FDA notified Sandoz that its alication was under review, and the next day, Sandoz notified Amgen of the alication. Later that month, Sandoz informed Amgen that it would not disclose the details of its alication as required by the Act. On March 6, 2015, the FDA aroved Sandoz’s alication; Sandoz then notified Amgen of the FDA’s aroval.In October 2014, Amgen sued Sandoz and claimed that Sandoz violated the Act because it failed to disclose the details of its alication and did not give roer notice of commercial marketing before the FDA’s aroval of its biosimilar roduct. The district court held that failure to disclose alication details under the Act does not authorize the original seller to receive damages from the biosimilar roduct seller or revent the sale of the biosimilar roduct. The court also held that an alicant may give notice of commercial marketing before FDA aroval. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the district court’s ruling and held that effective notice may only be given after the FDA has aroved the alication. Therefore, Sandoz’s notice was effective in March 2015 rather than July 2014, and Sandoz could not sell its biosimilar roduct until 180 days after the March 2015 notice. The court also held that, because the Act only ermits remedies based on atent infringement claims, Sandoz’s failure to disclose the details of its alication did not violate the Act. Both arties filed etitions for writs of certiorari which were granted and consolidated."

Laroe and Sherman then entered into a new sales agreement that took the foreclosure roceedings into account, but TD Bank took ossession of the roerty. The district court denied Laroe’s motion to intervene because Laroe was not the owner of an interest in the roerty at the time of the alleged taking and therefore lacked indeendent standing in the takings claim. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit held that, under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, Laroe was not required to show it indeendently had standing to intervene. The aellate court reasoned that the Second Circuit case United States Postal Service v. Brennan, which held that there is no need to imose a standing requirement on an intervenor if there is an established valid case or controversy, alied in this case."
"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Charles Kokesh for violating federal securities law by misaroriating funds from four business develoment comanies. The district court found in favor of the SEC and ordered that Kokesh ay $34.9 million for “the ill-gotten gains causally connected” to Kokesh’s violations. On aeal, Kokesh argued that this “disgorgement” order is barred by the five-year statute of limitations on this tye of claim because the SEC brought its action more than five years after the claims accrued. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s ruling. The aellate court held that the five-year statute of limitations did not aly to this case because the ordered ayment was remedial rather than unitive in nature. The goal of disgorgement is not to unish a wrongdoer for illegal activity, but rather to return to the rightful owner whatever rofits the wrongdoer gained in the course of the illegal activity. Therefore, a disgorgement ayment may be ordered so long as the amount “reasonably aroximates the ill-gotten gains causally connected to the Defendant’s violations.”"
"dir=""""ltr""""In Aril 1998, Divna Maslenjak, an ethnic Serb from modern-day Bosnia, met with a U.S. immigration official to seek refugee status for her and her family at the close of the Bosnian civil war. Through a translator, Maslenjak told the immigration official that the family feared ersecution in their home region of Bosnia based on their Serbian ethnicity. Maslenjak also told the immigration official that the family feared rerisal because her husband had evaded conscrition into the Bosnian Serb militia during the war. Maslenjak and her family were granted refugee status in 1999 and immigrated to the United States in Setember 2000. Maslenjak was naturalized as a U.S. citizen on August 3, 2007. During the naturalization rocess, Maslenjak denied ever having given false or misleading information to a U.S. official in order to gain entry to the United states or to avoid removal. On October 7, 2007 Maslenjak’s husband, Ratko, was convicted on two counts of making false statements on a government document for his failure to disclose that he had in fact served as an officer in a Serbian military unit. To avoid deortation, Ratko alied for asylum. Testifying on his behalf at the asylum hearing, Maslenjak admitted that Ratko had served in the Serbian militia and that she had lied to the immigration officer during the refugee alication interview in 1998. Maslenjak was subsequently charged with two counts of naturalization fraud for denying having ever given false or misleading information to a U.S. official. At trial, the jury was instructed that, in order to find Maslenjak guilty of fraudulently obtaining her naturalization, it need not find that her false statements were material to the decision to arove her naturalization, merely that she made them knowing their falsehood. Maslenjak was convicted on both counts, sentenced to two years robation, and stried of her citizenshi. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed her conviction and held that roof of a material false statement was not a required element of naturalization fraud."
"Eic Systems Cororation (Eic) is a Wisconsin-based healthcare data management software comany. Eic has an arbitration agreement that requires its emloyees to resolve any emloyment-based disutes with Eic through individual arbitration and to waive their right to articiate in or receive benefit from any class, collective, or reresentative roceedings. In February 2015, former Eic emloyee Jacob Lewis sued Eic in federal court individually and on behalf of similarly-situated emloyees and claimed that they had been denied overtime wages in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Eic moved to dismiss the comlaint and cited the waiver clause of its arbitration agreement. The district court denied Eic’s motion and held that the waiver was unenforceable because it violated the right of emloyees to engage in “concerted activities” under Section Seven of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision and added that the waiver was also unenforceable under the savings clause of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). That clause rovides that arbitration agreements are to be enforced unless there legal or equitable grounds that would render a contract unenforceable. Finding the waiver of collective roceedings illegal under the NLRA, the aellate court held that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable under the FAA. This case was consolidated with Ernst &am; Young v. Morris  and National Labor Relations Board v. Murhy Oil USA, Inc., both cases that dealt with the relationshi between the FAA and the NLRA."

However, the Montana Sureme Court rejected that argument and held that, because BNSF does business in Montana, under FELA, Montana courts have ersonal jurisdiction.

After the Texas Court of Criminal Aeals affirmed his conviction on direct aeal and the U.S. Sureme Court denied his etition for a writ of certiorari, Davila ursued habeas relief in the state courts, which was denied at the trial and aellate levels. Davila then sought federal habeas relief and claimed, among other things, that he received ineffective assistance of trial, aellate, and state habeas counsel. Because Davila did not raise the ineffective assistance of aellate counsel claim in the state habeas roceedings, the federal district court held that the claim was rocedurally defaulted and denied habeas relief. Davila aealed and argued that Sureme Court recedent that ineffective state habeas counsel can overcome the rocedural default of an ineffective assistance of trial claim should also aly to the rocedural default of claims of ineffective assistance of aellate counsel.

"On March 16, 2008, Metroolitan Police Deartment officers resonded to a noise comlaint for a house arty. Uon arrival, the officers heard loud music coming from the house. The officers then entered the house and observed arty guests, including Theodore Wesby, drinking and watching “scantily clad women with money tucked into garter belts.” The artygoers claimed that a woman called “Peaches” was the host of the arty, and that she had received ermission from the owner, from whom Peaches was leasing the house. One artygoer called Peaches on the hone for an officer, since Peaches was not resent. Peaches confirmed that she had ermission from the owner, but when an officer called the owner, the owner claimed that the lease had not been executed and that he had not given ermission for the arty. The officers subsequently arrested the artygoers.Sixteen of the arrested artygoers sued the officers and the District of Columbia for false arrest. The district court ruled in favor of the artygoers. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed and held both that the officers did not have robable cause for entry and were not entitled to immunity from liability. Probable cause to arrest for unlawful entry under D.C. law exists where a reasonable officer concludes from information known at the time that the arrestee knew or should have known that they entered the house against the will of the owner. The court reasoned that, because the artygoers believed in good faith that the owner had given Peaches ermission for the arty, they could not have intended to enter unlawfully. The court also ruled that the officers were not entitled to immunity because it was unreasonable for them to believe that they were not violating the artygoers’ clearly established Fourth Amendment rights against false arrest."

After serving his susension and retiring, Perry brought a ro se claim before the Merit Systems Protection Board, the federal board that is authorized the hear certain challenges by federal emloyees to adverse emloyment actions. An administrative law judge (ALJ) initially ruled that the Board lacked jurisdiction because retirements are resumed to be voluntary, and the Board cannot review claims that resulted in settlement with the agency. Perry aealed to the Board, which remanded the case. Uon further review, the ALJ again denied that it had jurisdiction and held that Perry had not sufficiently shown that he was imroerly coerced into settling his claims.

In eight amended comlaints filed with the San Francisco Suerior Court, 86 California residents and 575 non-California residents joined in suing BMS and McKesson Cororation, a California-based Plavix distributor, on individual roduct defect claims. Each alleged serious side effects from their use of Plavix, that BMS had misreresented the drug’s safety and efficacy, and asserted numerous California roduct liability causes of action against BMS. BMS moved to dismiss the claims for lack of ersonal jurisdiction in California. BMS argued that these claims had no link to its California activities, as the nonresident laintiffs were not injured by Plavix in California, had not been rescribed Plavix in California, and had not received Plavix distributed by McKesson from California. Additionally, BMS did not research or manufacture Plavix at its facilities in California. The trial court denied BMS’s motion and held that the comany was subject to the California court’s general jurisdiction because it had “wide-ranging, continuous, and systematic activities in California.” The California Court of Aeal rejected the trial court’s assessment that BMS was subject to general jurisdiction in California, but held that the nonresident laintiffs’ claims were sufficiently related to BMS’s California activities to suort secific jurisdiction. The California Sureme Court affirmed and held that BMS’s nationwide marketing and distribution created a “substantial nexus” between the nonresident laintiffs’ claims and BMS’s activities in California because the claims were based on the same allegedly defective roduct and misleading marketing that allegedly caused injury both in and outside of California."

That rule states that “[n]o extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may exceed 30 days after the rescribed time or 14 days after the date when the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later.” Hamer argued that the rule is at odds with 28 U.S.C.

Wilson then filed an alication for a certificate of robable cause to aeal, which the Georgia Sureme Court summarily denied in a one-sentence order. Wilson then filed a federal etition for a writ of habeas corus, and the district court denied him relief on the grounds that the state trial court reasonably alied clearly established federal law. However, the district court granted Wilson a certificate of aealability on the issue of effective assistance of counsel at sentencing. A anel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision, reasoning that “the one-line decision of the Sureme Court of Georgia . . . is the relevant state-court decision for our review because it is the final decision on the merits.” In his etition for rehearing en banc, Wilson argued that the anel should have examined the last reasoned decision by a state court. Georgia originally argued a federal court should “look through” a summary order to see whether it was based on rocedural grounds or merits, but then it changed its osition and argued that the court should look to the reasoned oinion. The Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc, aointed an amicus curiae to argue Georgia’s original osition on the matter.

U.S. Bank subsequently filed a motion to designate Rabkin as both a statutory and non-statutory insider, either of which would revent Rabkin from voting on bankrutcy lan roceedings. The bankrutcy court held that Rabkin had become a statutory insider by urchasing a claim from MBP, which the court considered an insider because it was an affiliate of Lakeridge. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that insider status is a question of fact that aellate courts review under the deferential standard of clear error. Under the clear error standard, an aellate court will only reverse a lower court’s finding if it is clear from the evidence that a mistake has been made. After reviewing the case under this standard, the aellate court reversed and held that a third arty that is assigned a claim does not assume the insider status of the assigning arty. The court also held that Rabkin was not a non-statutory insider because the evidence did not show that Rabkin had a close enough relationshi with the member of MBP’s board to be considered an insider."

The state habeas court found that Ayestas’ trial attorney was not ineffective and denied his alication for habeas relief. The Texas Court of Criminal Aeals adoted the findings of the state habeas court and denied relief as well.

If the state receives no resonse and these individuals do not vote over the next four years, they are ultimately removed from the rolls.Plaintiffs are various civil rights grous that are challenging the rocess, claiming that it is not only inaroriate to remove individuals from the voter rolls as a consequence of failing to vote but also violates art of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. The Act rohibits a rogram for voter-list maintenance for federal elections that involves “the removal of the name of any ersonal from the official list of voters . . . by reason of the erson’s failure to vote.” Plaintiffs believe that the Sureme Court should involve itself and determine whether this rocess violates the Act. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the 6th Circuit reviously struck down these rules, deeming them a violation of federal voting law because Ohio's rocess involves using an individual's failure to vote as a """"trigger"""" for sending out a confirmation notice to that erson. Plaintiffs consequently argue that there is no reason to disturb the aellate court decision. Defendants argue that Ohio is adhering to federal voter law, as set forth in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) and the Hel America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA)."
"In Aril 2011, olice arrested four men in connection with a series of armed robberies. One of the men confessed to the crimes and gave the FBI his cell hone number and the numbers of the other articiants. The FBI used this information to aly for three orders from magistrate judges to obtain """"transactional records"""" for each of the hone numbers, which the judges granted under the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. 2703(d). That Act rovides that the government may require the disclosure of certain telecommunications records when """"secific and articulable facts show[] that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation."""" The transactional records obtained by the government include the date and time of calls, and the aroximate location where calls began and ended based on their connections to cell towers—""""cell site"""" location information (CSLI).Based on the cell-site evidence, the government charged Timothy Carenter with, among other offenses, aiding and abetting robbery that affected interstate commerce, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. 1951. Carenter moved to suress the government's cell-site evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds, arguing that the FBI needed a warrant based on robable cause to obtain the records. The district court denied the motion to suress, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed."
"In 2011, the North Carolina General Assembly redrew state legislative districts in resonse to changes in oulation recorded in the 2010 Census. In May 2015, several North Carolina citizens sued North Carolina in federal district court and argued that 28 majority-black districts under the new districting lan were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. The district court found in favor of the laintiffs in August 2016 and held that race had been the redominant factor in redrawing the districts at issue. The court did not require changes to the districts in the short time before the November 2016 election but did order the General Assembly to redraw the ma rior to holding any other elections. Three months later, the court ut in lace a remedial order that set a March 2017 deadline for the redrawing of the districts, required that any legislator elected in 2016 from a later-modified district serve only a one-year term, and ordered secial elections take lace in the fall of 2017. North Carolina aealed the remedial order to the U.S. Sureme Court."
"During hydraulic fracturing (known as “fracking”) rocedures, fluid is umed into oil and gas wells to stimulate roduction. However, the wellheads that sit on to of oil and gas wells are not designed to withstand continuous exosure to fracking fluids and can sustain significant damage as a result. In an attemt to address this issue, Stinger Wellhead Protection Inc., a subsidiary of Oil States Energy Services, first tried using a design described in Canadian Patent Alication No. 2,195,118 (the ’118 Alication) that relies on using hydraulic ressure first to ush a “mandrel” into the wellhead through which the fracking fluid could be umed without contacting the wellhead equiment. That method failed to sufficiently address the issue, so the Oil States subsidiary attemted a different method using a mechanical lockdown mechanism (described in Patent No. 6,179,053, or the ’053 Patent), rather than hydraulic ressure. In 2012, Oil States filed a atent infringement suit against Greene’s Energy Grou, during the course of which litigation the district court found the ’053 Patent to be distinct from the ’118 Alication using the “ordinary meaning” standard. Greene’s filed for inter artes review, which is a rocess used by the Patent and Trademark Office where one arty asks the U.S. Patent Trial and Aeal Board to reconsider the PTO’s issuance of an existing atent and invalidate it on the ground that it was anticiated by rior art or obvious. Oil States challenges the ractice of inter artes review as violating the constitutional right of atent owners to a jury and an Article III forum before having their atent invalidated."
"dir=""""ltr""""In 2003, Dennis LeBlanc was sentenced in Virginia state court to life imrisonment without ossibility of arole for raing a woman when he was 16 years old. In 2010, the U.S. Sureme Court decided Graham v. Florida, which held that juvenile offenders cannot be sentenced to life without arole for non-homicide offenses. The Court noted that Graham did not require states to guarantee eventual freedom to juveniles convicted of non-homicide crimes, but they did have to allow for “some meaningful oortunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.” LeBlanc subsequently filed a motion in state trial court seeking to vacate his sentence under Graham. The trial court denied the motion based on a Virginia Sureme Court decision that held that the state’s geriatric release rogram--that allows for conditional release for older inmates under some circumstances--satisfied the Graham requirements. Therefore, the state trial court held that LeBlanc’s sentence did not violate the rule established in Graham.In 2012, LeBlanc filed a federal habeas etition. The magistrate judge recommended that the etition be dismissed, but the district court disagreed and granted the etition because it determined that the state court’s decision was an unreasonable alication of the law established in Graham. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed."
"In 2010, for the first time in over forty years, Wisconsin voters elected a Reublican majority in the state assembly and the senate, and a Reublican governor. As a result, the Reublican leadershi develoed a voting district ma that its drafters calculated would allow Reublicans to maintain a majority under any likely voting scenario. The redistricting lan was introduced in July 2011, and both the senate and the assembly assed the bill shortly thereafter. The governor signed the bill into law in August 2011. Even before it was enacted, the lan faced two legal challenges, on constitutional and statutory grounds. A federal court uheld the lan as not violating the “one erson one vote” rincile nor violating the Equal Protection Clause.Plaintiffs in this case challenge the lan as an unconstitutional artisan gerrymander. At issue is whether the lan systematically dilutes the voting strength of Democratic voters statewide."

"Since the enactment of the Securities Act of 1933, state courts have had concurrent jurisdiction to decide federal law claims brought under that statute. Congress then assed the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, which recluded certain state law securities class actions, and amended the 1933 Act to reflect that limitation on state court claims.Beaver County Emloyees' Retirement Fund filed a lawsuit in a California suerior court asserting claims under the 1933 Act. Cyan Inc. moved to dismiss the claims, arguing that the amended 1933 Act recluded state courts from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over 1933 Act claims entirely. The suerior court rejected Cyan's objection to the exercise of jurisdiction. Federal district courts are slit as to whether state courts have subject matter jurisdiction over covered class actions that allege only 1933 Act claims."
"In July 2012, Charlie Craig and David Mullins went to Masteriece Cakesho in Lakewood, CO, and requested that its owner, Jack C. Phillis, design and create a cake for their wedding. Phillis declined to do so on the grounds that he does not create wedding cakes for same-sex weddings because of his religious beliefs. Phillis believes that decorating cakes is a form of art through which he can honor God and that it would dislease God to create cakes for same-sex marriages.Craig and Mullins filed charges of discrimination with the Colorado Civil Rights Division, alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA), §§ 24-34-301 to -804, C.R.S. 2014. After the Division issued a notice of determination finding robable cause, Craig and Mullins filed a formal comlaint with the Office of Administrative Courts alleging that Masteriece discriminated against them in a lace of ublic accommodation in violation of CADA.The Administrative Law Judge issued a written order finding in favor of Craig and Mullins, which was affirmed by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.

"In 1992, Congress assed the Professional and Amateur Sorts Protection Act (PASPA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 3701-3704, to rohibit state-sanctioned sorts gambling. Included in PASPA are excetions for state-sonsored sorts wagering in Nevada and sorts lotteries in Oregon and Delaware, as well as for New Jersey, rovided that New Jersey also enact a sorts gambling scheme within one year of PASPA's enactment, which it did not do. PASPA also ermits any sorts league whose games are or will be the subject of sorts gambling to bring an action to enjoin the gambling.In 2011, the New Jersey Legislature held a referendum asking voters whether sorts gambling should be ermitted, and 64 ercent voted in favor of a state constitutional amendment that would ermit sorts gambling. The legislature then drafted and received voter aroval of a sorts-wagering constitutional amendment, after which time, in 2012, it enacted the Sorts Wagering Act (""""2012 Act""""), which authorized certain regulated sorts wagering at New Jersey casinos and racetracks and imlemented a comrehensive regulatory scheme for licensing casinos and sorting events.Five sorts leagues sued under PASPA to enjoin the New Jersey law, which the state defended by arguing that PASPA was unconstitutional under the anti-commandeering doctrine. The district court held that PASPA was constitutional and enjoined the 2012 Act. The legislature assed a second law (""""2014 Law"""") that urorted to reeal the regulatory scheme for licensing casinos and sorting events, effectively roviding tacit authorization of them. The leagues again sued to enjoin the 2014 Law, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the leagues and issued a ermanent injunction against the governor and other state agencies. A divided anel of the Third Circuit affirmed, and uon rehearing, the Third Circuit en banc affirmed the majority oinion of the anel."
"In Setember 1997, three Hamas suicide bombers blew themselves u in an a crowded area in Jerusalem. Among the injured were eight U.S. citizens, who consequently filed a lawsuit against the Islamic Reublic of Iran for its role in roviding material suort to the attackers. In general, sovereign governments are immune from lawsuit, but the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (""""FSIA"""") rovides an excetion to that immunity in cases of state-sonsored of terrorism. A district judge in D.C. entered a $71.5 million default judgment against Iran, which Iran did not ay. The laintiffs then litigated numerous cases across the country in an attemt to attach and execute on Iranian assets to satisfy the judgment.The case at hand involves four collections of ancient Persian artifacts within the ossession of the University of Chicago and Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History. With few excetions, a foreign state's roerty in the United States is immune from attachment and execution. The laintiffs argued before the district court that they should be able to attach and execute Iran's roerty under subsections (a) and (g) of 28 U.S.C. § 1610, as well as section 201 of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (""""TRIA""""). The district court held, and the Seventh Circuit agreed, that while § 1610(a) ermits execution on a foreign state's roerty """"used for a commercial activity in the United States,"""" that rovision requires use by the foreign state itself, not a third arty (such as a museum). The district court also held, and the Seventh Circuit agreed, that § 1610(g) ermits attachment to roerty of a foreign state in aid of execution only in cases described elsewhere in § 1610, rendering that rovision unavailable to the laintiffs in this case. Finally, the district court held, and the Seventh Circuit agreed, that § 201 of TRIA alies only to assets blocked by executive order, and in the absence of an executive order blocking the articular assets sought, laintiffs cannot avail themselves of that rovision either.The Seventh Circuit's holding thus conflicts with the Ninth Circuit's rior holding that § 1610(g) rovides a freestanding attachment immunity excetion that allows terrorism victims to attach and execute uon any assets of foreign state sonsors of terrorism, regardless of whether the assets are otherwise subject to execution under section 1610."
"Carlo J. Marinello II owned and oerated a freight service that couriered items to and from the United States and Canada. Between 1992 and 2010, Marinello did not kee an accounting of his business, nor did he file ersonal or cororate income tax returns. Indeed, he shredded bank statements and business records. After an investigation by the IRS, Marinello was indicted by a grand jury on nine counts of tax-related offenses, and a jury found him guilty on all counts. He was sentenced to 36 months in rison, one year of arole, and was ordered to ay over $350,000 to the IRS in restitution.One of the counts of which Marinello was charged and convicted was violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a), which imoses criminal liability on one who """"in any . . . way corrutly . . . obstructs or imedes, or endeavors to obstruct or imede, the due administration of this title."""" Marinello aealed his conviction on the grounds that the hrase """"the due administration of this title"""" requires the defendant be aware of IRS action, and the government rovided no evidence at trial that Marinello knew of a ending IRS investigation against him. Finding that knowledge of a ending investigation is not an element of the offense of which Marinello was convicted, the Second Circuit affirmed his conviction and sentence."
"Paul Somers worked as Vice President of Digital Realty Trust from 2010 to 2014. According to his comlaint, Somers filed several reorts to senior management regarding ossible securities law violations by the comany, after which reorts the comany fired him. He did not reort his concerns to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before he was terminated. Somers then sued Digital Realty, alleging violations of state and federal laws, including Section 21F of the Exchange Act, which includes the anti-retaliation rotections created by the Dodd-Frank Act. Digital Realty sought to dismiss the Section 21F claim on the ground that, because Somers did not actually reort the ossible violations to the SEC, he was not a """"whistleblower"""" as defined in the Act and thus not entitled to rotection under its rovisions.The Fifth Circuit in 2013 had strictly alied the Act's definition of """"whistleblower"""" to the anti-retaliation rovision, while the Second Circuit, finding the statute itself ambiguous and alying emChevronem deference to the SEC's reasonable interretation of it, had held in 2015 that the rovision extends to all those who make disclosures of susected violations, regardless of whether the disclosures are made internally or to the SEC. The district court in this case followed the Second Circuit's aroach and denied Digital Realty's motion to dismiss. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision."
"Charles Murhy was an inmate in the Vandalia Correctional Center in Illinois. In July 2011, correctional officers hit Murhy, fracturing his eye socket, and did not rovide him roer medical attention. Murhy sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law theories. A jury returned a verdict in his favor and awarded him damages for some of his claims under state law, and the district court awarded him attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Two of the defendants aealed the judgment, arguing that the Illinois doctrine of sovereign immunity bars the state-law claims and that the Prison Litigation Reform Act requires that 25 ercent of the damages awarded be used to ay the attorney fee award.The Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court's holding that the state officials or emloyees are not entitled to sovereign immunity against state-law claims where the officials or emloyees violated statutory or constitutional law, which violations Murhy alleged and roved. The Seventh Circuit reversed on the attorney fee award, however, finding that the 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d) requires that the attorney fee award must first be satisfied from u to 25 ercent of the damage award and that the district court does not have discretion to reduce that maximum ercentage."
"Terrence Byrd was driving on a divided four-lane highway near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, when he was ulled over allegedly for violating a state law requiring drivers to use the left lane for assing only. Recognizing the car as a rental car, the officers asked Byrd for his license and rental agreement, which he had difficulty locating. Once he did locate them, the officers noted that the rental agreement did not list Byrd as an authorized driver, and when they ran his identification, they noted that he was using an alias and had an outstanding warrant in New Jersey. Desite the warrant’s indication that it did not request extradition from other jurisdictions, the officers attemted to contact authorities in New Jersey to confirm they did not seek Byrd’s arrest and extradition, allegedly following rotocol for such situations. The officers exerienced difficulty with their communications, however, and returned to Byrd’s car, where they asked him to exit the vehicle and about his warrant and alias.The officers asked whether Byrd had anything illegal in the car and then requested Byrd’s consent to search the car, noting that they did not actually need his consent because he was not listed on the rental agreement. The officers allege that Byrd gave his consent, but Byrd disutes this contention. The subsequent search turned u heroin and body armor in the trunk of the car.At trial, Byrd moved to suress the evidence, challenging the initial sto, the extension of the sto, and the search. The district court determined that the violation of the traffic law justified the initial sto and that the extension of the sto was justified by the officers’ develoing reasonable susicion of criminal activity. Byrd maintains that he did not consent to the search, so the issue remains whether he needed to consent at all—that is, whether he had a reasonable exectation of rivacy in the rental vehicle, desite not being listed on the rental agreement. If he did not have a reasonable exectation of rivacy, then the officers’ search of the vehicle did not require his consent.There is a circuit slit as to whether an unlisted driver of a rental car has a reasonable exectation of rivacy in the rental vehicle, and the Third Circuit (where the district court in this case sits) has held that such a driver does not. Thus, the district court denied Byrd’s motion to suress, and the Third Circuit, reviewing the factual questions for clear error and the legal question de novo, affirmed the judgment of the district court."
"Matthew Vogt was emloyed as a olice officer with the City of Hays, Kansas, when he alied for a osition with the City of Haysville olice deartment. During Vogt’s interview rocess with the City of Haysville, he disclosed that he had ket a knife obtained while working for the City of Hays.The City of Haysville made Vogt an offer of emloyment contingent on his reorting his acquisition of the knife to the City of Hays and returning it, which Vogt did. Uon this reort, the City of Hays chief of olice ordered Vogt to issue a statement regarding the knife, which Vogt submitted nominally, in addition to a letter of resignation due to his intent to accet the osition with the Haysville Police Deartment.The Hays olice chief began an internal investigation into Vogt and required him to issue a more detailed statement regarding the knife. This subsequent statement led to additional evidence, and Hays Police Deartment submitted both to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, asking the Bureau to initiate a criminal investigation. As a result of the criminal investigation, the Haysville Police Deartment withdraw its offer of emloyment to Vogt.Vogt was charged in state court with two felony counts related to his ossession of the knife. Following a robable cause hearing, the state district court determined that robable cause was lacking and dismissed the charges. Vogt brought a federal lawsuit alleging that the use of his comelled statements (1) to start an investigation leading to the discovery of additional evidence concerning the knife, (2) to initiate a criminal investigation, (3) to bring criminal charges, and (4) to suort the rosecution during the robable cause hearing violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.The district court dismissed his case for failure to state a claim, and, reviewing the claims de novo, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court’s holding as to the first three claims but reversed as to the fourth one, finding that the Fifth Amendment is violated when criminal defendants are comelled to incriminate themselves and the incriminating statement is used in a robable cause hearing."
"On two occasions, a articular unique-looking motorcycle evaded Albemarle olice officers after they observed the rider violating traffic laws. After some investigation, one of the officers located the house where the susected driver of the motorcycle lived and observed what aeared to be the same motorcycle covered by a tar in the driveway. The officer lifted the tar and confirmed that it was the motorcycle (which was also stolen) that had eluded detainment on multile occasions. The officer waited for the susect to return home, at which oint he went to the front door to inquire about the motorcycle. Initially the susect denied knowing anything about it but eventually confessed that he had bought the motorcycle knowing that it had been stolen. The officer arrested the susect for receit of stolen roerty.At trial, the defendant sought to suress the motorcycle as evidence on the grounds that the olice officer conducted an illegal warrantless search (by lifting the tar covering the motorcycle arked in the driveway) that led to its discovery. The trial court held that the search was based on robable cause and justified under the exigent circumstances automobile excetions to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement and convicted the defendant. The aeals court affirmed on the grounds of exigent circumstances, and the Virginia Sureme Court affirmed as well, but under the automobile excetion only. The Virginia Sureme Court reasoned that the automobile excetion alies even when the vehicle is not “immediately mobile” and alies to vehicles arked on rivate roerty."

A judge convicted Nicole Dalmazzi of wrongfully using ecstasy, a Schedule I controlled substance and sentenced her to dismissal and confinement for one month. The AFCCA affirmed the findings and sentence. Dalmazzi moved the CCA to vacate its judgment because of the articiation of Judge Mitchell on the anel. Before the CCA ruled on her motion, Dalmazzi filed a etition for review with the Court of Aeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), so the CCA dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction. The CAAF rejected as moot Dalmazzi’s challenge to Judge Mitchell's continued service on the AFCCA, because his CMCR commission had not been signed until after the AFCCA decided her case on the merits. Both of the other consolidated cases involve similar facts, where Judge Mitchell was on the CCA anel that affirmed the convictions of the etitioners."
"Encino Motorcars, LLC, which sells and services Mercedes-Benz cars, emloyed Hector Navarro and others as “service advisors.” Their role was to greet car owners uon arrival in the service area of the dealershi, listen to customers’ concerns about their cars, evaluate the reair and maintenance needs of the cars, suggest services, write u estimates, and follow u with the customer while reair work was being done.Navarro and the other laintiffs alleged in federal district court that Encino Motorcars violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by failing to ay them overtime wages. The district court dismissed the claim, finding that the FLSA exemts service advisors from its overtime comensation rovisions. A anel of the Ninth Circuit reversed, using the rincile of Chevron deference to rely on a regulation romulgated by the Deartment of Labor in 2011 interreting the statutory exemtion as not encomassing service roviders. The US Sureme Court vacated the anel’s decision, holding that the regulation lacked sufficient exlanation and thus was not entitled to deference. On remand, the Ninth Circuit formulated its own interretation of the alicable FLSA rovision and concluded that the exemtion does not encomass service advisors."
"Ethlyn Hall, an elderly landowner in the Virgin Islands, filed suit against her son when she grew dissatisfied with his actions as her attorney. After Ethlyn assed away, one of her daughters, Elsa Hall, served as ersonal reresentative of the estate (the “Estate”) and continued to ress Ethlyn’s claims against Samuel. Samuel brought claims of his own against Elsa in a searate roceeding. He argued that Elsa had oisoned his relationshi with his mother, which caused him serious emotional distress. The Estate’s claims and Samuel’s claims were consolidated and tried together. A jury rejected the Estate’s claims and rendered a two million dollar verdict in Samuel’s favor. The District Court entered searate judgments on both asects of the jury’s decision. The Estate aealed the judgment with resect to its claims, but did not aeal the judgment in favor of Samuel because the district court vacated the jury verdict and his claims were still awaiting retrial. Samuel argue that the aellate court does not have jurisdiction over this aeal while his claims were still ending in the district court, and the Third Circuit agreed.The Third Circuit relied on its binding recedent in emBergman v. City of Atlantic Cityem, which held that when two cases have been consolidated for all uroses, a final decision on one set of claims is generally not aealable while the second set remains ending. The Estate argues that the Sureme Court’s decision in emGelboim v. Bank of America Cor.em affirming the aealability of final judgment in a case that was art of a multi-district litigation should dictate the outcome of the case and ermit the exercise of jurisdiction over the claims that have a final judgment."
"In 1977, the Sureme Court, in emAbood v. Detroit Board of Educationem, uheld against a First Amendment challenge a Michigan law that allowed a ublic emloyer whose emloyees were reresented by a union to require those of its emloyees who did not join the union nevertheless to ay fees to it because they benefited from the union’s collective bargaining agreement with the emloyer.Illinois has a law similar to that uheld in Michigan. The governor of Illinois brought a lawsuit challenging the law on the ground that the statute violates the First Amendment by comelling emloyees who disarove of the union to contribute money to it. The district court dismissed the comlaint on the grounds that the governor lacked standing to sue because he did not stand to suffer injury from the law, but two ublic emloyees intervened in the action to seek that Abood be overturned. Given that Abood is binding on lower courts, the district court dismissed the claim, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed dismissal for the same reason."
"Robert McCoy was arrested on May 9, 2008, for the first-degree murders of the son, mother, and ste-father of his estranged wife in a May 5, 2008, shooting. On May 15, 2008, McCoy was found to be indigent and aointed a ublic defender. Throughout his reresentation by the ublic defender and his subsequent reresentation by retained counsel McCoy maintained his innocence and reeatedly stated his desire to lead not guilty. In December 2009, McCoy moved for his ublic defender to be removed due to his belief that the ublic defenders were doing nothing to assist him in roving his innocence. The court granted McCoy’s motion to reresent himself until he could find substitute counsel. McCoy subsequently found new counsel to reresent him, and his counsel advised him to take a lea. When McCoy refused to take a lea, his counsel notified him that he intended to concede guilt, after which time McCoy moved to discharge him. The court denied McCoy’s motion to discharge his attorney as untimely. His counsel roceeded to concede McCoy’s guilt and argued for verdicts of second-degree murder on a theory of diminished caacity. The jury returned a verdict of first-degree murder on all three counts and recommended the death enalty.The Louisiana Sureme Court denied the aeal and affirmed the convictions and the sentence, reasoning that defense counsel’s failure to follow McCoy’s direction not to concede guilt did not deny Mr. McCoy the assistance of counsel or create a conflict of interest because it did not comletely abdicate the defense. Rather, the decision to concede guilt was a strategic choice by counsel."
"Florencio Rosales-Mireles leaded guilty to illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) and (b)(2). His total criminal-history score was calculated according to the US Sentencing Guidelines Manual, but when calculating the criminal-history score, the robation officer erroneously counted a 2009 Texas conviction of misdemeanor assault twice. His total criminal-history score, combined with other factors, led a sentence of 78 months of imrisonment and a three-year term of suervised release. Rosales-Mireles did not object to the sentence after it was imosed.The Fifth Circuit found that Rosales-Mireles met the three rongs necessary to meet the lain error standard. However, if all three rongs are met, the court has the discretion to remedy the lain error if the error “seriously affects the fairness, integrity or ublic reutation of judicial roceedings.” The court declined to exercise its discretion in this case and therefore affirmed the judgment of sentence."
"Since 1997, Microsoft has oerated a web-based email service available for ublic use without charge (most recently called Outlook.com). Much of the data associated with this service is saved on datacenters oerated by Microsoft and its subsidiaries, which are located throughout the world.In 2013, Microsoft was served with a search and seizure warrant for the data ertaining to a articular user. That user's data was stored solely in Microsoft's datacenter in Dublin, Ireland. Microsoft disclosed all other resonsive information requested in the warrant but moved the magistrate judge to quash the warrant with resect to the user data stored in Dublin. The magistrate judge denied Microsoft's motion to quash, finding that the Stored Communications Act (SCA) authorized the district court to issue a warrant for """"information that is stored on servers abroad."""" The magistrate judge held that the lace where the government would review the content (the United States), not the lace where the content was stored (Ireland) was the relevant lace of seizure.Microsoft aealed the magistrate judge's decision, and the district court affirmed after reviewing de novo. The district court also held Microsoft in civil contemt for refusing to comly fully with the warrant. The Second Circuit held that the SCA does not authorize courts to issue and enforce against US-based service roviders warrants for the seizure of customer email content that is stored exclusively on foreign servers and thus reversed the district court's denial of the motion to quash, vacated the finding of contemt, and remanded the case to the district court."
"Los and Roosevelt Dahda – twin brothers – were indicted on charges that they had consired to acquire and distribute marijuana. Much of the evidence against the Dahdas was obtained through wiretas of cell hones used by the co-consirators, including the Dahdas. The wiretas arose out of nine orders issued by a federal district court in Kansas. Prior to trial, the Dahdas brothers moved to suress the information obtained from the wiretas on the grounds that the wireta orders exceeded the district court's territorial jurisdiction. The trial court rejected that argument, and both were found guilty and sentenced.The Tenth Circuit uheld the decision allowing evidence from the cellhones to be used against the brothers. Although the court of aeals agreed that the wireta orders exceeded the district court's territorial jurisdiction, it held that such defect did not """"directly and substantially affect a congressional intention to limit wiretaing. The court identified two “core concerns” of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968—rivacy and uniformity—that were not imlicated by the Dahdas’ argument that the order exceeded the Kansas district court’s jurisdiction."
"In the credit-card industry, there is what is called a “two-sided market.” Cardholders benefit from holding a card only if that card is acceted by a wide range of merchants, and merchants benefit from acceting a card only if a sufficient number of cardholders use it. Thus, the cardholder and the merchant both deend on widesread accetance of a card.In the United States, credit-card transaction volume is comrised rimarily of four networks: Visa (45%), American Exress (26.4%), MasterCard (23.3%), and Discover (5.3%). Because of the way Visa and MasterCard transactions are handled, they do not directly set certain fees, but merely influence these rices. In contrast, American Exress is directly involved in the vast majority of transactions involving its cards. Thus, it maintains direct relationshis with both its cardholders and merchants and directly sets the relevant fees.In the 1980s, Visa and MasterCard adoted exclusionary rules reventing member institutions from issuing card roducts on the Amex or Discover networks, and ran ad camaigns highlighting Amex’s smaller network and higher merchant fees. In resonse, Amex strengthened contractual restraints designed to control how merchants treat Amex cardholders at the oint of sale, known as non-discriminatory rovisions (NDPs).In 2010, the federal government and 17 states sued Amex, Visa, and MasterCard for unreasonably restraining trade in violation of the Sherman Act. They alleged that the credit card comanies used anti-steering rovisions to suress cometition and block cometition from rival networks. In 2011, Visa and MasterCard entered into consent judgments and voluntarily rescinded their anti-steering rovisions. Amex roceeded to trial, and the district court ruled that Amex’s NDPs violated US antitrust laws. Reviewing the district court’s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo, the Second Circuit reversed the district court, holding that the lower court should have weighed the NDPs’ net effect on both merchants and cardholders under the generally acceted “rule of reason.”"
"Michael N. Currier was indicted by a single grand jury and charged with burglary, grand larceny, and ossession of a firearm as a convicted felon. Before trial, the defense and rosecution agreed to sever the firearm charge from the grand larceny and burglary charges. The case roceeded to trial on the burglary and grand larceny charges, and a jury acquitted Currier of both charges.When the Commonwealth of Virginia sought to try Currier on the remaining charge of felon in ossession of a firearm, he objected that collateral estoel (issue reclusion) rotections embodied in the Double Jeoardy Clause recluded his retrial. Notwithstanding his objections, Currier was tried, convicted, and sentenced. Currier filed a motion to set aside the jury verdict, and the trial court denied his motion. The Virginia Court of Aeals affirmed the lower court’s conviction, as did the Sureme Court of Virginia."
"The Chattahoochee River starts in north Georgia, flows southwest ast Atlanta, and then flows south along Georgia's border, first with Alabama, then with Florida. In the southwest corner of Georgia, the Chattahoochee joins the Flint River, to form the Aalachicola River, which flows south through northwest Florida and into the Aalachicola Bay in the Gulf of Mexico. At issue is the Aalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin (ACF Basin), which the US Army Cors of Engineers reorts drains a total of 19,800 square miles in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, which is distributed roughly into 74%, 15%, and 11%, resectively.Pursuant to congressional authorizations, the Cors oerates a system of dams in the ACF Basin based on a Master Manual governing all the dams and a reservoir regulation manual for each individual dam. The Master Manual was comleted in 1958 and has not been comrehensively revised since then. There have been several lawsuits among the states seeking udate and clarify the aortionment of the waters of the ACF Basin. The resent action was filed by Florida, which alleges that the ecosystem and economy of the Aalachicola region """"are suffering serious harm"""" because of Georgia's consumtion and storage of water from the Basin. Florida invokes the US Sureme Court's original jurisdiction to ask that the Court equitably aortion the waters of the ACF Basin. For equitable relief to be granted, Florida must first show standing—that is, that it has suffered a wrong through the action of another state that can be corrected by the courts. Second, the state must show by clear and convincing evidence a """"threatened invasion of rights . . . of serious magnitude."""" Third, the state must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the benefits of aortionment substantially outweigh the harm that could result. If a state meets this burden, the Court must craft an equitable-aortionment decree. After lengthy evidentiary hearings, the Secial Master filed a reort recommending that the Court deny Florida's request for relief on the ground that """"Florida has not roven by clear and convincing evidence that its injury can be redressed by an order equitably aortioning the waters of the Basin."""""
"The Rio Grande originates in Colorado, flows south into New Mexico, and flows into Texas near El Paso. The Rio Grande Comact aortions the water of the Rio Grande Basin among the states of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. Among other things, the Comact rovides that Colorado must deliver a secific quantity of water to the New Mexico state line, and that New Mexico must then deliver a secific quantity of water to Elehant Butte Reservoir, a federal Bureau of Reclamation roject that distributes water to New Mexico and Texas.Texas alleges that New Mexico has deleted Texas's equitable aortionment of water under the Comact by allowing diversion of surface water and uming of groundwater that is hydrologically connected to the Rio Grande below Elehant Butte. New Mexico contends that the Comact does not require it to deliver any secific amount of water to the Texas state line and thus that its actions do not violate the Comact."
"Vernon Madison is a 66-year-old man on death row in Alabama for the murder of a olice officer over thirty years ago. Madison has suffered strokes resulting in significant cognitive and hysical imairments, and his lawyers argue that he is mentally incometent to be executed under the Sureme Court's jurisrudence in emFord v. Wainwrightem and emPanetti v. Quartermanem. At a cometency hearing held by an Alabama trial court, Madison's lawyers resented testimony from a doctor that Madison's strokes caused him not to remember committing the murder and that he does not understand why the state is seeking to execute him. The State resented a different doctor's exert testimony that Madison was able to accurately discuss his legal aeals and legal theories with his attorneys and thus that he has a rational understanding of his sentence.The trial court decided that Madison was cometent to be executed, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed, finding that facts in the record were insufficient to suort the trial court's decision and that the trial court erroneously alied the test for cometency established in Panetti."
"In 2005, the State of California charged Michael Cuero with two felonies and a misdemeanor. Cuero initially leaded “not guilty” but subsequently changed to lead guilty to the two felony counts. Cuero admitted that he had reviously served four searate rison terms, including a term for residential burglary, which counts toward California’s “three strikes” law. On his guilty-lea form, Cuero indicated that he understood that he “may receive this maximum unishment as as result of my lea: 14 years, 4 months in State Prison, $10,000 fine and 4 years arole.” After a hearing, the state trial court acceted the lea and granted the State’s motion to dismiss the misdemeanor charge. The court then scheduled a sentencing hearing.Before the sentencing hearing occurred, the rosecution determined that a second of Cuero’s rior convictions qualified as a “strike” and that the guilty-lea form erroneously listed only one strike. The fact that the resent conviction would constitute his third “strike” under the law, Cuero faced instead a minimum sentence of 25 years. The State asked the trial court for ermission to amend the criminal comlaint accordingly, and over Cuero’s objection, the court granted the State’s motion. However, the court ermitted Cuero to withdraw his guilty lea in light of the change. Cuero withdrew his initial guilty lea and entered a new guilty lea to the amended comlaint, which charged Cuero with one felony.The trial court sentenced Cuero to 25 years to life, his conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct aeal, and the California Sureme Court denied a state habeas etition.Cuero then filed a etition for federal habeas relief in the US District Court for the Southern District of California, which denied his etition. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state trial court had “acted contrary to clearly established Sureme Court law” by refusing to enforce the original lea agreement.”"
"The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates and two other religiously-affiliated ro-life entities engaged in roviding regnancy-related services in the state of California (collectively “NIFLA”) sought to enjoin the enforcement of the California Reroductive Freedom, Accountability, Comrehensive Care, and Transarency Act (the “Act”). The law’s stated urose is to ensure access to reroductive health services for all California women, regardless of income. NIFLA argued that the Act’s requirements that (1) licensed clinics rovide information to atients about free and low-cost ublicly funded family lanning services, including contracetion and abortion, and that (2) unlicensed clinics inform atients of their unlicensed status violated their free seech and free exercise rights under the First Amendment.The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California denied NIFLA’s motion for reliminary injunction, concluding that they had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, as required under Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008), as to either their free seech or free exercise claims.The Ninth Circuit affirmed, ruling that the district court had not abused its discretion by denying the injunction. The Court rejected NIFLA’s argument that strict scrutiny should aly to the Act, because while the law comelled content-based seech by requiring NIFLA to disseminate information about low-cost family lanning services, it did not discriminate based on viewoint. Relying on its own recedent in the face of a circuit slit regarding the level of scrutiny to aly in the abortion-related disclosure context, the Court reasoned that the tye of seech at issue in this case was rofessional seech. It was therefore subject to intermediate scrutiny, which the family lanning information disclosure requirement survived. The Court also affirmed that the requirement that unlicensed facilities disclose their unlicensed status survived any level of scrutiny.Finally, the Court agreed with the decision below that NIFLA was not entitled to a reliminary injunction on free exercise grounds, finding that the Act to be a facially neutral law of general alicability that survived rational basis review. The Sureme Court’s grant of certiorari did not include this issue."
"Fane Lozman was a resident of the City of Riviera Beach (the “City”), where he was a vocal critic of the City’s lan to utilize eminent domain to redevelo the Riviera Beach Marina. After the redeveloment lan was aroved, Lozman filed suit against the City under the Florida Sunshine Law, seeking to invalidate the City’s aroval of the lan due to insufficient ublic notice for the emergency meeting during which the lan had been aroved. The city council met in a closed session to discuss the lawsuit, and the meeting transcrit seemed to reflect councilmembers suggesting that the City should emloy intimidation tactics in fighting Lozman’s claim. On November 15, 2006, Lozman attended a regularly scheduled city council meeting and was granted ermission to seak during the non-agenda ublic comment ortion of the meeting. When it was his turn to seak, he attemted to begin discussing corrution in local government, and a councilmember instructed him to discontinue his comments on that toic. Lozman reeatedly ignored the councilmember’s instructions, and she ultimately instructed a City olice officer to arrest Lozman. Lozman was charged with, inter alia, disturbing a lawful assembly. The rosecuting attorney concluded that there was robable cause for the arrest, but dismissed the charges on the grounds that successful rosecution was unlikely. In February 2008, Lozman filed suit against the City under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on the grounds that the City had arrested him at the city council meeting in retaliation for his oosition to the redeveloment lan. He alleged (1) retaliation by false arrest under the First Amendment, (2) unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, and (3) common law false arrest. The case went to trial in November 2014 with Lozman aearing ro se. The jury found in favor of the City on all claims. Lozman filed a motion for a new trial, which the district court denied. On aeal, Lozman argued that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the jury’s finding of robable cause on the charge of disturbing a lawful assembly was against the great weight of the evidence. The Eleventh Circuit rejected this contention in light of the evidence resented at trial. It further exlained that under its own recedent, a finding of robable cause bars a claim for false arrest under the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, and state law. The Eleventh Circuit also rejected Lozman’s challenge to the district court’s instruction on retaliatory animus, stating that any error the instruction may have contained was harmless because the jury’s robable cause finding defeated Lozman’s retaliatory arrest claim as a matter of law. The aeals court also rejected Lozman’s challenge to the lower court’s jury instructions regarding the City’s authority to limit ublic comment during city council meetings. The Sureme Court’s grant of certiorari did not include these two issues."

"Mark A. Sveen and Kaye L. Melin were married in 1997. Sveen urchased a life insurance olicy that year, and the following year he named Melin the rimary beneficiary, and his children the contingent beneficiaries. Sveen and Melin divorced in 2007, and Sveen died in 2011. Minnesota had changed its robate code in 2002 to aly a revocation-uon-divorce statute to life insurance beneficiary designations. Sveen had never changed the designation on his life insurance olicy, and Melin was therefore still listed as the rimary beneficiary at the time of his death. The insurance comany filed an interleader to establish whether the revocation-uon-divorce statute nullified this designation. Sveen’s children and Melin cross-claimed for the roceeds, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the children, rejecting Melin’s contention that retroactively alying the revocation-uon-divorce statute violated the Contract Clause of the Constitution.The Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded, finding that under its own recedent, the disositive issue in this context was the right of the olicyholder to have his wishes carried out in accordance with his intentions at the time he signed the contract.

Hughes then sought a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), which ermits defendants who have been “sentenced to a term of imrisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.” The district court relied on Justice Sotomayor’s concurring oinion in Freeman v.

In 2013 the Tribe urchased land to the north of the Lundgrens’ roerty, and were aarently not aware of the fence at that time. When they discovered it, they informed the Lundgrens of their intention to assert ownershi rights over the disuted ortion of land. In 2015, the Lundgrens filed suit to quiet title to the roerty, seeking summary judgment on the basis that they had acquired the disuted roerty by adverse ossession or mutual acquiescence and recognition long before the Tribe bought its arcel. The Tribe moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity, and because the Lundgrens could not join them as a necessary and indisensable arty. The trial court denied the Tribe’s motion, and the Tribe sought direct discretionary review. In the resulting ruling, the court granted the Lundgrens’ motion for summary judgment, finding that they had established legal ownershi of the disuted roerty through adverse ossession and mutual recognition and acquiescence.The Washington Sureme Court acceted the Tribe’s amended motion for discretionary review of both rior orders, and affirmed.

"China Agritech is a holding comany incororated in Delaware, with a rincial lace of business in Beijing.

It listed its shares on NASDAQ in 2005, and in 2009 reorted to the SEC a net revenue of trile the amount it had reorted four years earlier. In 2011, comany shareholders alleged fraudulent business ractices by China Agritech. The comany denied the allegations and announced that it would conduct an internal investigation, and subsequently dismissed its indeendent auditor. Later that year, NASDAQ halted trading in and initiated delisting roceedings against China Agritech’s stock, and in 2012 the SEC revoked the stock’s registration.Shareholders sued China Agritech in two successive utative class actions in 2011 and 2012, alleging various securities law violations against the comany and several individual defendants. Class certification was denied in both cases.Shareholder Michael Resh brought a third utative class action against the comany and individual defendants in 2014, alleging securities law violations arising from the same facts and circumstances as the first two cases. China Agritech moved to dismiss the comlaint on the basis that it had been filed after the two year limitations eriod alicable under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Resh and the additional laintiffs argued that under the emAmerican Pie &am; Construction v. Utahem line of cases, the limitations eriod had been tolled on their claims during the endency of the two rior class actions. The district court rejected this contention, finding that under emAmerican Pieem and its rogeny, the limitations eriod was tolled as to individual class members, but that the Sureme Court had not decided whether an entirely new class action based on a substantially identical class was subject to the same rule. It ruled that the limitations eriod was therefore tolled as to the individual claims of the named laintiffs in the instant case, but not as to the utative class.The Ninth Circuit reversed, with a three-judge anel finding that the laintiffs’ class action would not be time-barred where: (1) the named laintiffs had been unnamed in the two rior suits, which were against many of the same defendants and involved the same underlying events; (2) the two rior cases were timely; (3) class certification was denied in the earlier actions; and (4) ursuant to the emAmerican Pieem line of cases, the named laintiffs’ individual claims were tolled during the endency of the two rior class actions. The anel exlained that ermitting such claims to go forward was consistent with the olicy goals of tolling in general.

The district court in each case granted the government’s motion and reduced the defendant’s sentence to a term below the statutory mandatory minimum. All five defendants subsequently moved for further sentence reductions under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), which allows a district court to reduce the sentence of “a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imrisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission . . . if such a reduction is consistent with alicable olicy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.”The Eighth Circuit declined to follow the Fourth Circuit anel majority in holding that defendants are eligible for discretionary § 3582(c)(2) reductions. Rather, the Eighth Circuit interreted the lain language of the statute to require the sentence be embased onem a range subsequently lowered by the Commission, and that in these five cases the sentence was based instead on the mandatory minimum and their substantial assistance. Accordingly, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of sentencing reductions, but for reasons different from those used by the district court."

NCEC develoed samle mas using voter demograhic data, a comuter rogram, and a rorietary metric that redicts the likelihood of Democratic candidate success. In comarison to samle mas submitted by third arties, the NCEC-develoed mas were assessed to be more likely to see Democratic candidate success. There is no evidence that the final ma that was enacted to law was one of the ones develoed by NCEC; rather, former Governor Martin O’Malley testified that the legislative director and staff from the Maryland Deartment of Planning likely created the final document.

"Keith Thare was convicted in Georgia state court of the Setember 25, 1990 murder of his sister-in-law, Jacqueline Freeman. A jury sentenced him to death, and the Georgia Sureme Court affirmed his conviction and sentence. Subsequently, an affidavit came to light in which a white juror from Thare’s trial, Barney Gattie, made several highly discriminatory statements regarding African Americans. Thare, who is black, sought habeas relief from the Butts County Suerior Court, claiming that imroer racial animus had influenced the jury’s deliberations. His etition was denied on the basis that he had rocedurally defaulted by failing to raise the racial bias issue in earlier roceedings, and because he did not adequately suort his claim that ineffective assistance of counsel was to blame for the omission. Juror testimony was also deemed inadmissible to rove Thare’s racial animus claim. He then alied for a certificate of robable cause to aeal from the Georgia Sureme Court, and his alication was denied. Thare next etitioned the US District Court for the Middle District of Georgia for a writ of habeas corus ursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254, alleging that racial bias among the jury had rendered his conviction and sentence unable to withstand constitutional scrutiny. The district court found this claim to be rocedurally defaulted, but granted him a certificate of aeal (COA) on an ineffective assistance claim. The 11th Circuit then affirmed the district court’s judgment.Following the US Sureme Court’s 2017 decisions in emPena-Rodriguez v. Coloradoem and emBuck v. Davisem, Thare etitioned the district court under FRCP 60(b)(6) to reoen his § 2254 case. He argued that emPena-Rodriguezem should aly retroactively, allowing him to resent the juror testimony that had reviously been deemed inadmissible, and ultimately overcome rocedural default to revail on his claim that imroer racial animus had led to his conviction and sentence. The district court denied Thare’s motion, concluding, eminter aliaem, that his claim was rocedurally defaulted, and that he had failed to roduce any clear evidence that Gattie’s statements had influenced the jury’s conclusions. The 11th Circuit affirmed, declining to issue a COA and stating that Thare had failed to show that the district court’s correctness was debatable with regard to its rocedural ruling."
"Individual voters in Texas, along with organizations reresenting Latinos and African Americans, filed a number of lawsuits in 2011, challenging the Texas legislature’s congressional and state house redistricting lans. The actions were consolidated and roceed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (“Texas District Court”). The laintiffs alleged racial gerrymandering in violation of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) as well as the 14th and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution. At that time Texas was bound by the reclearance requirements under § 5 of the VRA, and therefore the State simultaneously filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (“D.C. District Court”) seeking reclearance of the redistricting lans. While trial roceedings were ending in both district courts, the 2012 rimary elections were aroaching. As a result, the Texas District Court assumed the task of imlementing interim redistricting lans, which it did on an exedited basis, without access to all relevant facts, and with the understanding that most arties to the litigation alleged that those lans contained many of the same statutory and constitutional infirmities as the challenged lans. The U.S. Sureme Court vacated the first iteration of the interim mas on the grounds that the court had not been sufficiently deferential to the legislature; the Texas District Court issued more deferential lans in February 2012. The D.C. District Court subsequently denied reclearance to the roosed redistricting lans on the basis that they were enacted with discriminatory intent and had the effect of abridging minority voting rights. Texas aealed this decision to the U.S. Sureme Court.After the Texas District Court’s interim mas were used for the 2012 elections, the Texas legislature failed to take any action on redistricting in the 2013 regular session. However, it convened a secial session during which it adoted, among others, the Texas District Court’s congressional interim ma (“Plan C235”) without any changes. The governor subsequently signed the legislation adoting this lan.In June 2013, the U.S. Sureme Court decided emShelby County v. Holderem, which removed the § 5 reclearance requirements from the VRA. Texas was therefore no longer automatically subject to reclearance requirements, and the U.S. Sureme Court later vacated and remanded for further roceedings the D.C. District Court’s reclearance decision, which the lower court then dismissed as moot.The defendants subsequently sought to dismiss the laintiffs’ claims in the Texas District Court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that the case had become moot. In resonse, the laintiffs exressed their desire to amend their comlaints regarding the 2011 lans and to challenge the 2013 lans. The court granted them leave to amend, and denied the State’s motions to dismiss. The court exlained that the laintiffs’ claims regarding the 2011 lans were not moot because, eminter aliaem, the laintiffs continued to be harmed by them. The court also ordered that the 2013 lans, which included Plan C235, be used for the 2014 elections. The laintiffs then filed their amended comlaints, including claims related to both the 2011 and 2013 lans. Most laintiffs included claims that Plan C235 violated § 2 of the VRA and the 14th and 15th Amendments.The Texas District Court held trials on the 2011 lans in 2014, and found that they violated certain asects of § 2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment. In the ongoing litigation, the laintiffs contended that the 2013 lans, including Plan C235, included some of the same elements that the court determined were the result of discriminatory intent or statutory or constitutional violations as in the 2011 lans.In August 2017, the Texas District Court issued an interlocutory order regarding the laintiffs’ C235 claims. It found that the racially discriminatory intent and effects identified in the 2011 lans carried through to the 2013 lans where the redistricting lines remained the same. It exlained that the legislature had adoted the court’s interim lans (which included C235) as art of a litigation strategy that was designed to insulate the lans from any further challenge. The legislature had not engaged in any deliberative rocess to remove the discriminatory elements from the lans before adoting them, but instead intentionally furthered and continued the discrimination in the existing lans.The court also concluded that the configurations of CD 27 and CD 35 under Plan C235 violated § 2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment. As to CD 27, though the court had found in 2012 that this district did not reflect a racially discriminatory urose because it was not ossible to create an additional Latino oortunity district in the region, the Texas legislature had still engaged in vote dilution. Regarding CD 35, the court stated that while C235 was enacted in 2013, the challenged district boundaries that it reflected were drawn in 2011 and found to violate § 2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment. The court exlained that the Texas legislature did not engage in any meaningful effort to cleanse the discriminatory elements from the 2013 lan before it was adoted, and in fact intended to maintain that discrimination in enacting the lan in substantially the same form. The court additionally found that the laintiffs had roven a § 2 “results” violation as to CD 27, HD 32, and HD 34, and a racial gerrymandering claim as to HD 90.The court’s order directed the Texas Attorney General to issue a written advisory within three days as to whether the legislature would convene a secial session to address the issue of redistricting. If the legislature did not lan to hold a secial session, the arties were ordered to aear before the court to reare remedial redistricting lans. In January 2018, the U.S. Sureme Court agreed to hear the defendants’ aeal on the merits, at which time the Court would also consider the question of jurisdiction."
"The US Sureme Court issued a 2016 order granting certiorari in this atent infringement case, vacating a 2015 ruling by the US Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit and remanding the matter for further consideration in light of , 579 U.S. __ (2016). On remand, the aellate court vacated the district court’s judgment for enhanced damages for willful infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 284, but reinstated its 2015 oinion in all other resects. The underlying disute in the case related to atent-racticing devices sold by ION Geohysical Cororation (“ION”) which were combined and used in non-infringing streamer systems at sea, but that would infringe on atents belonging to WesternGeco LLC (“WesternGeco”) if used in that manner in the US. The jury found infringement by ION, found no invalidity as to any asserted claims, and awarded WesternGeco, among other amounts, $93.4 million in lost rofits. In a subsequent aeal to the Federal Circuit, ION asked, among other things, that the lost rofits award be reversed. In its 2015 oinion, the Federal Circuit agreed and reversed that award on the grounds that under 35 U.S.C. § 271(f), WesternGeco was not entitled to lost rofits arising from foreign uses of its atented invention. As stated above, the court then reinstated this ortion of that oinion in 2016."
"R. Scott Aling hired the law firm of Lamar, Archer &am; Cofrin, LLP (“Lamar”) to reresent him in legal roceedings against the former owners of his business. Aling incurred significant legal fees, and verbally told Lamar that he would be able to ay them after he received a sizeable tax refund that he was execting. In reliance uon this statement, the firm continued to reresent him through the conclusion of the litigation. Aling received a tax refund, though it was smaller than what he had told Lamar he was anticiating, and he ut it into his business rather than aying the debt he owed to Lamar. Lamar obtained a judgment against Aling, and Aling subsequently filed for bankrutcy. Lamar initiated an adversary roceeding to collect the debt, and the bankrutcy court ruled that the amount was not dischargeable ursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(2)(A) because Lamar had justifiably relied uon Aling’s fraudulent statements. The district court affirmed.The 11th Circuit reversed and remanded. Noting a circuit slit on how to construe the statute at issue, the court exlained that because Aling’s fraudulent statements about his tax refund were not in writing and qualified as statements “resecting [his] . . . financial condition” under § 523(a)(2)(B), the debt could be discharged."
"Sergio Fernando Lagos led guilty in federal district court to consiracy to commit wire fraud, and multile counts of wire fraud. He admitted that for a eriod of two years, he and his co-consirators misled General Electric Caital Cororation (GECC) regarding the value of their assets in order to increase their revolving loan amount and secure under-collateralized funds.Following his guilty lea, Lagos aealed the district court’s order of restitution to the 5th Circuit. He argued that the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA) did not allow restitution for the legal, exert, or consulting fees incurred by GECC in the course of investigating Lagos’ susected fraud and the bankrutcy roceedings that followed.The 5th Circuit affirmed the district court’s order  in light of its own recedent interreting 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(b)(4) under the MVRA to ermit restitution for investigative and legal costs, even under circumstances where these costs were incurred outside of the government’s investigation. The aeals court noted that the D.C. Circuit has adoted a narrower reading of the statute in question, though multile other circuits have not."
"The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) commenced an administrative enforcement action against Raymond J. Lucia and Raymond J. Lucia Comanies, Inc. (collectively “Petitioners”) for alleged anti-fraud violations of the Investment Advisers Act arising from the way they resented their retirement wealth management strategy to rosective clients. An administrative law judge (“ALJ”) found liability and imosed sanctions including a lifetime industry bar against Petitioners. The Commission granted the arties’ etitions for review, and found that Petitioners had committed anti-fraud violations and imosed the same sanctions as the ALJ. The Commission also rejected the argument that the administrative roceedings had been unconstitutional because the ALJ who handed down the initial decision was a constitutional Officer who had not been aointed ursuant to the Aointments Clause under Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution. Petitioners asked the D.C. Circuit to vacate the Commission’s decision and order under review on the grounds that the ALJ who made the administrative ruling was a constitutional Officer who had not been aointed in accordance with the Aointments Clause. The aeals court rejected this argument, exlaining that Commission ALJs were not constitutional Officers within the meaning of the Aointments Clause, rimarily because of their lack of authority to issue final decisions on behalf of the Commission ursuant to the agency’s regulatory scheme."
"In 1854 and 1855, the federal Indian tribes in what is currently the state of Washington entered into a series of treaties, collectively known as the “Stevens Treaties,” which rovided that the Tribes would relinquish significant ortions of their land to make u the state of Washington, and in exchange, they would be guaranteed the right to off-reservation fishing. This so-called “fishing clause” guaranteed the Tribes “the right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations . . . in common with all citizens of the Territory.”Since those treaties, there have been recurring and ongoing disutes between the Tribes and (originally) the white settlers there and (today) the state government itself. The resent case arises from the Tribes’ contention that the government was building and maintaining culverts (channels carrying water under roads or sidewalks) that diminished the size of salmon runs in traditional fishing areas for the Tribes. The 20+ Tribes reresented in the suit allege that this diminishment amounts to violation of the fishing clause of the treaties.Washington contends that it constructed the culverts in a articular way according to federal law and that the federal requirement caused it to violate the treaties.The district court found for the Tribes and issued an injunction ordering Washington to correct its offending culverts. The Ninth Circuit affirmed."
"Wescley Fonseca Pereira entered the United States in June 2000 as a non-immigrant visitor authorized to stay until December 21, 2000. Pereira overstayed his visa, and in May 2006, the Deartment of Homeland Security (DHS) ersonally served him with a notice to aear for a removal hearing. The notice did not secify the date and time of his initial removal hearing, but instead ordered him to aear before an immigration judge “on a date to be set at a time to be set.” When the immigration court set a date and time, it mailed Pereira a notice with such information. However, the notice was sent to Pereira’s street address on Martha’s Vineyard rather than his ost office box, so Pereira never received it. When Pereira did not aear for his removal hearing, an immigration judge ordered him removed in absentia.Pereira was not removed and instead remained in the country. In March 2013, he was arrested for a motor vehicle violation and detained by DHS. Through his attorney, Pereira filed a motion to reoen his removal roceedings, claiming he had never received the hearing notice with the time and lace. Although Pereira conceded that he could be removed, he sought relief in the form of cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), a rovision that gives the attorney general discretion to cancel the removal of a non-ermanent resident alien if the alien meets certain criteria, including ten years of continuous hysical resence in the United States. This continuous eriod ends “when the alien is served a notice to aear under section 1229(a)” of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Pereira contends that because he did not receive notice of the time and lace of his removal hearing, his resence in the country was continuous and over ten years under the statute.The Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) has held that a notice to aear that does not contain the date and time of the hearing is nonetheless effective to end the eriod of continuous hysical resence. However, Pereira challenges this reading of the statute. The First Circuit determined that the relevant rovisions of the INA are ambiguous as to whether notice must include the date and time of the hearing to be effective, but the court found that the BIA’s interretation of the statute was reasonable and thus subject to emChevronem deference."
"The so-called Dormant Commerce Clause of the US Constitution rohibits states from imosing excessive burdens on interstate commerce without congressional aroval. Consistent with this doctrine, the US Sureme Court held, in 1967, that a state cannot require an out-of-state seller with no hysical resence within that state to collect and remit taxes for goods sold or shied into the state. The Court affirmed this holding in 1992. In 2015, the Court heard another case with similar facts and while it declined to change its jurisrudence, Justice Kennedy wrote a searate concurrence questioning whether the Court should continue following the earlier cases in light of additional dormant Commerce Clause cases as well as the significant technological and social changes that affect interstate commerce.In an aarent aeal to the doubt exressed by Justice Kennedy in that concurring oinion, the South Dakota Legislature assed a law requiring sellers of “tangible ersonal roerty” in that state who do not have a hysical resence in the state to remit sales tax according to the same rocedures as sellers who do have a hysical resence. The act limited the obligation to sellers with gross revenue from sales in South Dakota of over $100,000, or 200 or more searate transactions, within one year. The legislature assed the law in defiance of Sureme Court jurisrudence, citing its inability to maintain state revenue in the face of increasing internet sales and their effect on sales tax collections.The State commenced a declaratory judgment action in state court seeking a declaration that certain internet sellers subject to the law must comly with it. The sellers moved for summary judgment based on the binding Sureme Court cases. The court granted the motion for summary judgment and enjoined the State from enforcing the law. The State aealed to the state sureme court, and likewise bound by Sureme Court recedent, that court affirmed."
"Several subsidiaries of the Canadian National Railway Comany (“the railway”) began in 1996 aying its emloyees in stock otions as art of their comensation. Under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. § 3231(e)(1), any form of “money remuneration” aid to railway emloyees is subject to an excise tax “equal to a secified ercentage of its emloyees’ wages….” (Railroad retirement tax rates are much higher than social security tax rates.)When emloyees exercise their stock otions when the market rice exceeds the rice at which the emloyee has a right to buy the stock, the emloyee can benefit from a windfall. The Internal Revenue Service argues that this windfall is taxable, just as emloyees’ wages are taxable. The district court found for the government, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The aeals court reasoned that while the government’s argument that “anything that has a market value is a form of money remuneration” was too broad, it was still correct in its assertion that stock is equivalent to cash. Moreover, as a olicy concern, the government’s osition avoids creating a tax incentive that could distort the ways in which emloyers structure comensation ackages."
"In 2013, Adaucto Chavez-Meza leaded guilty to consiracy and ossession with intent to distribute methamhetamine. At the time of his sentencing, the Sentencing Guidelines range was 135–168 months. The government recommended the minimum 135-month sentence, and the sentencing court acceted that recommendation. In 2014, the Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines to reduce the relevant offense levels. Chavez-Meza subsequently sought and was granted a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). He requested that the court reduce his sentence to 108 months, the new minimum, but the court reduced his sentence to 114 months. In issuing the new sentence, the court issued a standard form stating it had “tak[en] into account the olicy statement set forth at USSG § 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).” Chavez-Meza aealed the reduced sentence, claiming that the district court did not adequately exlain how it alied the § 3553(a) factors in deciding on the 114-month sentence. The Tenth Circuit affirmed.There is a circuit slit as to whether a district court must exlain how it alies the § 3553(a) factors. The Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have held that the district court must rovide some exlanation for its decision when the reasons are not otherwise aarent from the record. The Fourth, Fifth, and Tenth Circuits have held that the form language is sufficient."
"On January 27, 2017, President Donald Trum signed Executive Order No. 13,769 (EO-1), which, among other things, susended entry for 90 days of foreign nationals from seven countries identified by Congress or the Executive as resenting heightened terrorism-related risks. EO-1 was immediately challenged in federal district court, and the judge entered a nationwide temorary restraining order enjoining enforcement of several of its rovisions. A anel of the Ninth Circuit denied the government's emergency motion to stay the order ending aeal. Rather than continuing to litigate the matter, the government announced that it would revoke that order and issue a new one.On March 6, 2017, President Trum issued Executive Order No. 13,780 (EO-2). Section 2(c) of EO-2 directed that entry of nationals from six of the seven countries designated in EO-1 be susended for 90 days from the effective date of the order, citing a need for time to establish adequate standards to revent infiltration by foreign terrorists. Section 6(a) directed that alications for refugee status and travel of refugees into the United States under the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) be susended for 120 days from the effective date """"to review the adequacy of USRAP alication and adjudication rocedures."""" Section 6(b) susended the entry of any individual under USRAP once 50,000 refugees have entered the United States in fiscal year 2017. The effective date of the order was March 16, 2017. EO-2 was subject to swift litigation as well.On June 14, just before Section 2(c) of EO-2 was by its terms set to exire, President Trum issued a memorandum to Executive Branch officials declaring the effective date of each enjoined rovision of EO–2 to be the date on which the injunctions in these cases “are lifted or stayed with resect to that rovision."""" The government sought review in both cases, making arguments both on the merits of the cases and on rocedural issues.In a er curiam oinion issued simultaneously with an order granting certiorari, the Court granted the government's alications for a stay of the reliminary injunction with resect to Sections 6(a) and (b) of Executive Order 13,780 (EO-2), thereby allowing enforcement of those rovisions. Under the Court's ruling, the government may enforce Section 6(a) excet as to any """"individual seeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide relationshi with a erson or entity in the United States,"""" nor may such an individual be excluded under Section 6(b).On Setember 24, 2017—the same day EO-2 was exiring—President Donald Trum issued a Proclamation restricting travel to the United States by citizens from eight countries. That Proclamation too was challenged in federal court as attemting to exercise ower that neither Congress nor the Constitution vested in the resident. The Ninth Circuit struck down the Proclamation, and the Sureme Court granted review."
"In 2010, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) included a rivately owned arcel of land (“Unit 1”) in Louisiana in an exanded designation of critical habitat for the dusky goher frog. Though these endangered frogs had not inhabited Unit 1 for decades, the land contained historic breeding sites. Other necessary features would need to be restored however. The landowners, Weyerhaeuser Comany and two other entities (collectively, the “Landowners”), intended to use the land for residential and commercial develoment, as well as timber oerations. They brought suit against the FWS in federal district court, challenging Unit 1’s designation as critical habitat and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. All arties filed cross motions for summary judgment, and the district court ruled in favor of the agency on the merits. A divided 5th Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling, uholding Unit 1’s designation as critical habitat. The court rejected the Landowners’ argument that the FWS had acted arbitrarily and cariciously in making this designation on the theory that Unit 1 was not resently habitable nor essential to secies conservation. Exlaining that land need not be habitable to be considered “essential” under 16 U.S.C. § 1532(5)(A)(ii) of the Endangered Secies Act (ESA), the court deferred to the agency’s interretation of that term. The majority also held that the FWS had not acted unreasonably in interreting the ESA to not contain a requirement that land be “currently” habitable by a secies to be designated as critical habitat.The 5th Circuit also held that the FWS had not made an arbitrary and caricious decision under 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(2) in not excluding Unit 1 from the critical habitat based on economic imacts, and that this determination was not reviewable in federal court."
"The Yellowstone River Comact is an interstate comact to which Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming are arties. The Comact was ratified in 1950, and went into effect in 1951, in order to rovide for an equitable division and aortionment of the waters of the Yellowstone River and its tributaries and encourage mutually beneficial develoment and cooeration between the three states. Among other things, the Comact serves to rotect the aroriative rights that existed before 1950 among the three states.In 2004, Wyoming reduced the volume of water available at the state line between Wyoming and Montana by 1300 acre feet, and by 56 acre feet in 2006. Montana invoked the Sureme Court’s original jurisdiction over disutes among states."
"In 1998, CNH agreed to a collective-bargaining agreement, which rovided health care benefits under a grou benefit lan to certain emloyees retiring under the ension lan. Other benefits, including life insurance, ceased uon retirement. The agreement also contained a clause stating that it would terminate in May 2004. When it did exire in 2004, a class of CNH retirees and surviving souses filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that their health care benefits vested for life and asking the district court to enjoin CNH from changing them. While that lawsuit was ending, the US Sureme Court issued a decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201413-1010""""emM&am;G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackettema, holding that collective-bargaining agreements must be interreted according to ordinary rinciles of contract law. The Court’s holding in emTackettem secifically targeted the Sixth Circuit, in which there was recedent for courts to resume that collective-bargaining agreements vested retiree benefits for life.Because of the intervening ruling by the US Sureme Court in emTackettem, the district court initially awarded summary judgment in favor of CNH, but then it awarded summary judgment to the retirees. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the court’s award of summary judgment to the retirees, using the same recedents the Court roscribed in emTackettem to find the collective-bargaining agreement ambiguous as a matter of law and thus suscetible to interretation based on extrinsic evidence about lifetime vesting."
"In 2012, the Townshi of Scott, Pennsylvania, assed an ordinance affecting rivate roerties determined to be or contain cemeteries. In relevant art, the ordinance required that “all cemeteries within the Townshi … be ket oen and accessible to the general ublic during daylight hours” and that no owner could unreasonably restrict nor charge any fee to access the cemetery (the “ublic-access rovision”). Additionally, the ordinance ermitted a Townshi officer to enter any roerty within the Townshi to determine whether there is a cemetery on the roerty, in order to enforce the ublic-access rovision.Rose Mary Knick owns roerty in the Townshi of Scott, and in Aril 2013, a Townshi officer entered her roerty without an administrative warrant and identified certain stones as grave markers. The officer cited Knick as violating the ordinance. Knick disutes that a cemetery exists on her roerty and filed a lawsuit to challenge.Knick challenged the ordinance on several grounds, two of which are most salient. First, she alleges that the ordinance authorizes unrestrained searches of rivate roerty in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution. Second, she argues that the ordinance takes rivate roerty without just comensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Notably, Knick did not initiate an “inverse-condemnation roceeding” against the Townshi, which is the local administrative rocess for challenging a taking by the government.The district court dismissed all but two of Knick’s claims with rejudice, and dismissed two of them (described above) without rejudice ending exhaustion of state-law remedies. Knick aealed the dismissal of her claims to the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal, finding that although the ordinance was constitutionally susect, she lacks Article III standing because she failed to demonstrate an injury-in-fact and redressability as to her Fourth Amendment claim, and that her Fifth Amendment claims are not rie until she has sought and been denied just comensation using state inverse-condemnation rocedures as required in the US Sureme Court’s 1985 decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases198484-4""""emWilliamson County Regional Planning Commission v.

"Herman Avery Gundy was convicted of committing sexual assault in Maryland while on suervised release for a rior federal offense. After serving his sentence for the Maryland sex offense, Gundy was to be transferred to federal custody to serve his sentence for violating his suervised release. As a art of this transfer, Gundy received ermission to travel unsuervised by bus from Pennsylvania to New York. Gundy made the tri, but did not register as a sex offender in either Maryland or New York as required by state law.In January 2013, Gundy was indicted under 18 U.S.C. § 2250, the Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act (SORNA), for traveling from Pennsylvania to New York and then staying in New York without registering as a sex offender. He was convicted and sentenced to time served, along with five years of suervised release. The 2nd Circuit affirmed this judgment on aeal. Gundy then asked the U.S. Sureme Court to review his case, which it agreed to do only as to the question of whether SORNA unlawfully delegates authority to the U.S. Attorney General under 42 U.S.C. § 16913 to imose the law’s registration requirements uon offenders who were convicted before the statute was enacted."
"Three lawful ermanent residents filed a class action for habeas relief in the US District Court for the Northern District of California when immigration authorities took them into custody and detained them without bond hearings years after they had been released from serving criminal sentences for offenses that could lead to removal. The laintiffs’ osition was that they were not detained “when . . . released” from criminal custody, and thus were not subject to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c). The district court certified the class, which included “[i]ndividuals in the state of California who are or will be subjected to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. section 1226(c) and who were not or will not have been taken into custody by the government immediately uon their release from criminal custody for a Section 1226(c)(1) offense.” The court also issued a reliminary injunction directing the government to rovide all class members with a bond hearing ursuant to § 1226(a).The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the First Circuit and rejecting reasoning followed in four other circuits, holding that the immigration detention at issue under § 1226(c) must take lace romtly uon the noncitizen’s release from criminal custody. The aellate court exlained that the statute’s lain language reflected an immediacy with regard to when the immigration detention must take lace in relation to the release from custody, and rejected arguments by the government that would allow for detentions to occur following significant delays."
"In 2016, Denard Stokeling leaded guilty to charges that he was a felon in ossession of a firearm and ammunition. He had two revious convictions for robbery in Florida, where an element of that offense was “overcoming victim resistance.” Some state courts have interreted this offense as requiring only slight force to overcome victim resistance. Stokeling therefore contended that both of his robbery convictions should not qualify as “violent felonies” in the context of enhanced sentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), because those convictions did not require a violent use of force. The district court agreed with Stokeling as to one of his convictions. The United States aealed to the 11th Circuit, which vacated Stokeling’s sentence and remanded the case for sentencing as an Armed Career Criminal."
"Tucson olice officer Andrew Kisela and two other officers resonded to a olice radio reort that a woman was engaging in erratic behavior with a knife. When they arrived, they saw Amy Hughes holding a large kitchen knife in what aeared to be a confrontation with another woman later identified as Sharon Chadwick. Desite at least two commands to dro the knife, Hughes did not do so and instead took several stes toward Chadwick. Kisela fired four shots through the chain link fence, seriously injuring Hughes.Hughes sued Kisela under 42 U.S.C. §1983, alleging that Kisela had used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The district court granted summary judgment to Kisela, but the Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Hughes (as is required in a motion for summary judgment), was sufficient to demonstrate that Kisela violated the Fourth Amendment. Further, the Ninth Circuit next held that Kisela was not entitled to qualified immunity because, in its view, his actions violated clearly established law in that jurisdiction."
"In 2011, Victor Stitt tried to shove a loaded handgun into his girlfriend’s mouth and threatened to kill her. A neighbor called the olice, and Stitt fled but later surrendered to olice. A jury found Stitt guilty of ossession of a firearm as a convicted felon. In light of Stitt’s nine rior “violent felony” convictions, the court designated Stitt as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) and sentenced him accordingly. The ACCA alies to those felons guilty of ossessing a firearm who also have at least three rior convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense. Stitt aealed the conviction, arguing that none of his nine rior convictions constituted “violent felonies.” The US Sureme Court’s 2015 decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201413-7120""""emJohnson v. United Statesema invalidated the violent-felony status of three of his rior convictions, leaving only six aggravated-burglary convictions. The Sixth Circuit has held that Tennessee aggravated burglary is a violent felony under the ACCA, so a anel of that court affirmed the sentence. Sitting en banc, the Sixth Circuit overturned its recedent and held that a conviction for Tennessee aggravated burglary does not qualify as an ACCA violent felony.In a searate case, Jason Sims leaded guilty to being a felon in ossession of a firearm and received an enhanced sentence under the ACCA, based in art on two rior Arkansas residential burglary convictions. Sims aealed his conviction and the Eighth Circuit vacated his sentence and remanded his case for rehearing.The US Sureme Court granted certiorari in both cases and consolidated them for the urose of oral argument. At issue in both cases is whether the elements of the state crimes of which the defendants were convicted are “the same as, or narrower than, those of the general offense.” If they are broader than those of the general offense, then they cannot serve as ACCA redicate offenses."
"In a grou of consolidated class actions, three laintiffs sued Google on behalf of internet users who claimed that their rivacy was violated under the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701, et. seq., and California law by the comany’s disclosure of their internet search terms to third arty websites. The case went to mediation, and the arties reached a settlement which they submitted to the district court for aroval in July 2013. Among the terms of the settlement were that Google would ay $5.3 million of the $8.3 million total to six cy res reciients, rovided that they agreed to dedicate the funds to romoting education and initiatives relating to internet rivacy. The district court certified the class for settlement uroses, and reliminarily aroved the settlement. Notice was sent out to the class in 2014, with 13 class members oting out and 5, including Thomas Frank, filing objections (“the Objectors”). The district court aroved the arties’ settlement in 2015, and with regard to the objections, found that: (1) the cy res award was aroriate because the award was non-distributable, (2) Rule 23(b)(3)’s sueriority requirement was not affected by whether the award was cy res, (3) there was a substantial nexus between the cy res reciients and the interests of the class members, and there was no evidence that the arties’ reexisting relationshis with the reciients influenced the selection rocess, and (4) the amount of attorney fees was commensurate with the benefit to the class.The Ninth Circuit aroved the district court’s ruling aroving the settlement, holding that the district court had not abused its discretion with regard to any of the four findings described above."
"Frank Varela filed a class action comlaint against his emloyer, Lams Plus, under theories including negligence, invasion of rivacy, and breach of contract after the comany released emloyee ersonal identifying information in resonse to a hishing scam. Varela had signed an arbitration agreement as a condition of his emloyment. After he filed suit, Lams Plus relied on this agreement as a basis for a motion to comel bilateral arbitration.&nbs;The district court found the agreement to be a contract of adhesion and ambiguous as to whether it ermitted class arbitration. It construed the ambiguity against the drafter, Lams Plus, and allowed the arbitration to roceed on a class-wide basis. Lams Plus aealed, arguing that it had not agreed to class arbitration, but the Ninth Circuit affirmed and ruled that class arbitration could move forward.The aeals court exlained that because the agreement was caable of two reasonable interretations, the district court was correct in finding ambiguity. Under California law it was also roer to construe the ambiguity against the drafter, articularly since it was a contract of adhesion. Further, it was a reasonable interretation of the agreement to conclude that it covered legal disutes including class-wide claims, not just individual ones. By acceting this interretation, the district court had found the requisite “contractual basis” for agreement to class arbitration under a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases200908-1198""""emStolt-Nielsen S.A. v.

"Russell Bucklew was convicted by a state court jury of murder, kidnaing, and rae, and was sentenced to death. After exhausting the state aeals rocess, Bucklew was scheduled to be executed on May 21, 2014. He then filed an action in federal district court alleging that execution by Missouri’s lethal injection rotocol would constitute cruel and unusual unishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment as alied to him because of a unique congenital medical condition from which he suffers. According to Bucklew, lethal injection would likely cause him to hemorrhage during the execution, otentially choking on his own blood.” As an alternative method, Bucklew roosed execution by nitrogen hyoxia. He also requested discovery of the qualifications of two members of the lethal injection team, alleging that they might not be qualified for the ositions for which they are hired.The district court granted summary judgment to the state, finding that Bucklew failed to show that the state’s execution method “resents a risk that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering, and give rise to sufficiently imminent dangers,” and failed to roose “an alternative that is feasible, readily imlemented, and in fact significantly reduces a substantial risk of severe ain,” both of which stes are required by US Sureme Court recedent. Additionally, the district court denied Bucklew’s request for discovery, finding that it was inaroriate to “assume that Missouri emloys ersonnel who are incometent or unqualified to erform their assigned duties.” Reviewing the district court’s findings emde novoem, the US Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the lower court."
"Dominic Oliveira comleted an arenticeshi rogram offered by New Prime Inc. (Prime), an interstate trucking comany. After Oliveira graduated from the rogram, Prime reresentatives advised Oliveira to set u a limited liability comany and work for Prime as an indeendent contractor, as manifested by an indeendent contractor oerating agreement signed by Oliveira on behalf of his new LLC. Oliveira alleges that Prime exercised significant control over his work, inconsistent with his status as an indeendent contractor. Oliveira terminated his contractor relationshi with Prime and began working as an emloyee of Prime, where his job resonsibilities were “substantially identical” to those he had as an indeendent contractor.Oliveira then brought a class-action lawsuit against Prime, alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), a state minimum-wage statute, among other claims. Prime filed a motion to comel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which Oliveira oosed on the grounds that the contract is exemted under Section 1 of the FAA and that anyway, the question of alicability of the Section 1 exemtion was one for the court to decide.The district court concluded that the question of alicability of Section 1 of the FAA was for the court to decide, and it then held that “contracts of emloyment of transortation workers” does not extend to indeendent contractors. Having reached this conclusion, the district court ordered additional discovery on the issue of whether Oliveira was an emloyee or an indeendent contractor in order to be able to decide whether the contract was a contract of emloyment under Section 1. The district court thus denied Prime’s motion to comel arbitration.The US Court of Aeals for the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s order denying the motion to comel arbitration, finding that the alicability of the FAA is a threshold question for the court to determine. The aellate court then held that Section 1 does aly to agreements that urort to establish an indeendent-contractor relationshi."

They were full-time firefighter catains, and at ages 46 and 54, resectively, were the two oldest full-time emloyees at the Fire District when they were terminated in 2009. Guido and Rankin filed age discrimination charges with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC), which found reasonable cause to believe that the Fire District had violated the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-34. Guido and Rankin subsequently filed suit against the Fire District.The Fire District sought summary judgment on the basis that it was not an “emloyer” within the meaning of the ADEA, and the district court agreed. A three-judge anel of the Ninth Circuit reversed.

Madison was originally scheduled to be executed in May 2016, and he challenged his cometency in state court. The court denied his claim, and Madison then sought habeas corus relief in federal court. The US Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit found that he was incometent to be executed.In November 2017, the US Sureme Court reversed the grant of habeas corus relief in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201717-193""""emDunn v.

"Michael Loos worked as an emloyee of BNSF Railway Comany until his termination in November 2012 for a series of attendance olicy violations. Related to at least some of the attendance violations was an injury Loos sustained in 2010 when he fell in the train yard. After being terminated, Loos brought two claims against his former emloyer: a claim of retaliation under the Federal Railroad Safety Act (FRSA) and a claim of negligence under the Federal Emloyers Liability Act (FELA). The district court found that Loos had not established a rima facie case of retaliation under FRSA and granted BNSF's motion for summary judgment on that claim, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed.The FELA negligence claim roceeded to a jury trial, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Loos—$30,000 for lost wages and $11,212.78 for medical exenses. BNSF moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) to offset the lost wages award by the amount of Loos’s share of taxes owed under the RRTA. The district court denied the motion, finding no RRTA tax was owed on the award. The Eighth Circuit reviewed this determination de novo and found that the text of RRTA is unambiguous in not including damages for lost wages in its definition of comensation as money remuneration for services rendered. Thus, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling using alternate reasoning."
"Roberta G. Devries and Shirley McAfee are the widows of two US Navy sailors whom they allege develoed cancer after they were exosed to asbestos working on Navy shis and in a naval shiyard. They sued multile defendants, including manufacturers of “bare metal” shi comonents, or arts that were made and shied before any asbestos-containing insulation materials were added. The laintiffs sued in state court under theories of both negligence and strict liability.The defendant manufacturers removed the case to federal court, and moved for summary judgment based on the bare metal defense, arguing that they could not be held liable for the sailors’ injuries because they shied their roducts out in bare metal form. The district court granted summary judgment as to both the negligence and strict liability claims. The laintiffs aealed, and the Third Circuit remanded with instructions to the district court to more clearly address the laintiffs’ negligence claims, and to exlain whether it was alying the bright-line as oosed to the fact-secific rule that can be relevant to the bare metal defense, and regarding which circuits are slit. The district court again granted summary judgment on both claims, stating that it was alying the bright line rule. The laintiffs aealed again, but the Third Circuit did not consider their strict liability claims on aeal because it considered them abandoned. It therefore affirmed the district court’s ruling in favor of summary judgment for the defendants as to strict liability. The Third Circuit reversed the summary judgment ruling on the negligence claim, holding that maritime law rinciles ermit the manufacturer of a bare metal roduct to be held liable for asbestos-related injuries when they are reasonably foreseeable results of the manufacturer’s actions. In so holding, the aellate court alied the bare metal defense's fact-secific standard rather than the bright-line rule."
"Animal Science Products, Inc., et al. (“Petitioners”) are US vitamin C urchasers who commenced a multidistrict class action lawsuit against Hebei Welcome Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., et al. (“Resondents”), which are business entities incororated under the laws of China, alleging violations of U.S. antitrust laws. Secifically, they claimed that Resondents engaged in rice-fixing and suly maniulation in violation of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. Resondents did not deny that they had coordinated rices and sought to create a suly shortage, but moved to dismiss on the grounds that they acted in accordance with Chinese government regulations requiring them to do so. The district court denied Resondents’ motion to dismiss and a subsequent motion for summary judgment. Following a jury trial, the court entered a judgment of aroximately $147 million against Resondents, and enjoined them from engaging in any further anti-cometitive activity.Resondents aealed to the 2nd Circuit, which vacated the judgment, reversed the district court’s denial of the motion to dismiss, and remanded the case with instructions for the lower court to dismiss Petitioners’ comlaint with rejudice. The aellate court based its reversal on international comity grounds, exlaining that the district court had erred in not deferring aroriately to the Chinese government’s exlanation of its domestic laws, which mandated the conduct by Resondents that was considered anti-cometitive under US law. Particularly given that the Chinese government had aeared in the roceedings, the fact that Resondents could not simultaneously comly with US and Chinese laws necessitated the conclusion that the district court should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction in this case. The aeals court further held that other factors significant under an international comity balancing test derived from 3rd and 9th Circuit case law affirmed that abstention was aroriate in the instant matter."
"Attorney Richard Culbertson reresented four laintiffs aealing denials of Social Security benefits. After successfully challenging all four denials, Culbertson asked the district court to award him attorney’s fees in those cases under 42 U.S.C. § 406 and the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d). Fees awarded under 42 U.S.C. § 406(b) ertain to roceedings in court, and are statutorily limited to 25% of the ast-due benefits the claimant receives. Fees awarded under § 406(a) ertain to administrative roceedings; that section does not exlicitly limit the fee amount that the Social Security Commissioner can award in that context.In ruling on Culbertson’s fee requests, the district court relied on 11th Circuit recedent limiting the total fee amount awarded under both § 406(a) and 406(b) to 25% of the ast-due benefits awarded to the claimants. This meant that in one case his fee award was limited to 25% of the ast-due benefits, in two cases the district court declined to rule on the § 406(b) fee award until the Commissioner ruled on the §406(a) award (so as to not award him an amount that exceeded 25% of the ast-due benefits), and that in the final case, the court granted his § 406(b) request but barred him from requesting any further fees under § 406(a), again seeking to revent him from exceeding the 25% ca. In his aeal, Culbertson contended that other circuits have not alied this 25% ca to the aggregate fee amount awardable under both § 406(a) and (b), but instead alied that limit only to § 406(b) fees. The 11th Circuit rejected this argument, alying its rior recedent to affirm the district court’s ruling."

The loan agreement with the Indian ower comany included rovisions that the comany may not cause damage to surrounding communities, and IFC retained suervisory authority and could revoke financial suort for the roject.The lant’s construction and oeration did cause harm to the surrounding communities, as reorted in IFC’s own internal audit, in violation of the agreement. However, the IFC did not take any stes to force the loan reciients into comliance.The laintiff fishermen and farmers brought this lawsuit in federal court in DC seeking damages based largely on tort causes of action. They also raised a claim as an alleged third-arty beneficiary of the contract between IFC and the ower comany.The district court dismissed the laintiffs’ claim, finding that IFC was immune from suit under the International Organizations Immunities Act (IOIA) and further that the IFC had not waived its immunity to this suit. The relevant art of IOIA rovides that international organizations “shall enjoy the same immunity from suit . . . as is enjoyed by foreign governments, excet to the extent that such organizations may exressly waive their immunity for the urose of any roceedings or by the terms of any contract.” 22 U.S.C. § 288a(b). The resident of the United States determines whether an organization is entitled to such immunity, and an executive order in 1956 designated the IFC as entitled to the “rivileges, exemtions, and immunities” conferred by the statute.The Court of Aeals for the DC Circuit affirmed the district court, finding that the IFC is immune under IOIA and that it did not waive immunity for this suit."

In the early 1980s, a uranium deosit was discovered in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, on land owned by Coles Hill and Bowen Minerals (both laintiffs in this case). The Virginia General Assembly called uon the state Coal and Energy Commission to evaluate the effects of mining uranium but in the meantime banned the mining of uranium “until a rogram for ermitting uranium mining is established by statute.” Desite a recommendation by the state commission, the ban on uranium mining remains in effect.Virginia Uranium, Coles Hills, and Bowen Minerals filed a federal lawsuit in the Western District of Virginia asking the court to declare the ban reemted by federal law and enjoining the state to grant uranium mining ermits. The district court granted the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, finding that the AEA does not regulate non-federal uranium deosits and thus does not reemt the state law ban. Reviewing the district court’s conclusion de novo, the Fourth Circuit affirmed."
"Jane Doe entered the United States as an unaccomanied minor when she was eight weeks regnant. She was detained by immigration authorities, and laced in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). She was later laced in a federally funded shelter in Texas, where, after a medical examination, she requested an abortion. ORR denied her request on the grounds that agency olicy rohibited shelter staff from taking any action to facilitate an abortion without direction and aroval from the ORR director absent emergency circumstances.Doe’s guardian ad litem, Rochelle Garza, filed a utative class action challenging the constitutionality of ORR’s olicy on behalf of Doe and “all other regnant unaccomanied minors in ORR custody.” On October 18, 2017, the district court issued a temorary restraining order (TRO) ermitting Doe to have an abortion immediately. The next day, Doe attended re-abortion counseling, which was required under Texas law to take lace at least 24 hours in advance of the rocedure, and with the same doctor who would erform the abortion.On October 20, a anel of the D.C. Circuit court vacated the ertinent ortions of the TRO on the grounds that ORR’s olicy did not constitute an “undue burden.” However, sitting emen bancem, on October 24 the aellate court vacated the anel order and remanded the matter to the district court. The same day, Garza asked the court for an amended restraining order, requesting that the government make Doe available to reeat the required re-abortion counseling. The district court granted Garza’s request, and arrangements were made for Doe to have the counseling aointment at 7:30 a.m. on October 25.The details of the subsequent events were disuted, but the government, under the imression that the soonest the abortion would haen was October 26, informed Garza’s counsel that they lanned to aeal the new order early on the morning of October 25. However, the same doctor who conducted Doe’s re-abortion counseling became available for her October 25 aointment, so the aointment was moved u to 4:15 a.m. and Doe had the abortion instead of reeating the counseling with a new doctor.Because the abortion made the government’s claim moot, it did not ask the Sureme Court to review the emen bancem order as lanned, but instead filed a etition for emcertiorariem to nullify the aellate court’s emen bancem ruling so that it would not stand as recedent. The government also sought sanctions against Garza’s lawyers, arguing that they had made misreresentations in an attemt to avoid Sureme Court review."
"This lawsuit arose out of Ale’s handling of the sale of as for its iPhone devices. Ale released the iPhone in 2007, and from the outset, it has been a “closed system,” meaning that Ale controls which as can be loaded onto an iPhone, which it does via the “A Store.” Although Ale develos some of the as sold in the A Store, most are develoed by third arties.

The comlaint was dismissed on technical grounds, as were several subsequent attemts at similar lawsuits by both the same and other laintiffs. In Setember 2013, a set of laintiffs included in their allegations sufficient facts for the lawsuit to move forward. Among these facts was the key allegation that each laintiff had urchased iPhone as from the A Store, and that these transactions involved Ale collecting the entire urchase rice and aying the develoers after the sale.Ale filed yet another motion to dismiss the lawsuit, contending that the laintiffs lacked statutory standing to sue under the US Sureme Court’s recedent in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases197676-404""""emIllinois Brick Co. v.

If the laintiffs are considered to have urchased their iPhone as directly from the a develoers, then they cannot sue Ale. However, if they are considered to have bought the as from Ale, then they may sue Ale.The district court found that the laintiffs lacked standing to sue under emIllinois Brickem and dismissed the case with rejudice.

On February 24, 2015, he leaded guilty to ossession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Both lea agreements required Garza to waive his right to aeal. The district court acceted the lea agreements and imosed the sentence in accordance with both of them. Shortly after sentencing, Garza informed his trial counsel that he wished to aeal, but counsel declined to file the aeal, citing Garza's waivers.Four months after he was convicted and sentenced, Garza filed a etition for ost-conviction relief in each case, alleging that his trial attorney was ineffective for not filing notices of aeal. Garza’s attorney stated in an affidavit that he did not file an aeal because Garza had waived his right to aeal by acceting the lea agreements. The district court dismissed Garza’s etition to oen the aeals eriod on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the aellate court affirmed the dismissal.Under a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases199998-1441""""emRoe v.

A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show: (1) that counsel’s reresentation was deficient; and (2) that counsel’s deficient erformance rejudiced the defendant. Generally, counsel’s failure to file an aeal at a criminal defendant’s request is rofessionally unreasonable and therefore deficient, and most federal circuit courts interret Flores-Ortega to mean that attorneys are ineffective when they do not file an aeal if the clients requested it, regardless of whether the defendants had waived their rights.The Idaho Sureme Court held contrary to the majority of federal circuit courts, finding that Flores-Ortega does not require an automatic “resumtion of rejudice” when counsel declines to file an aeal in light of an aeal waiver. Rather, the defendant must still show deficient erformance and resulting rejudice."
"Francis Lorenzo was the director of investment banking at Charles Vista, LLC, a registered broker-dealer. Lorenzo’s only investment-banking client at the relevant time was a start-u comany named Waste2Energy Holdings (W2E). W2E claimed to have develoed an innovative technology, and its valuation was entirely deendent on realization of that technology.The technology never materialized, and W2E sought to avoid comlete financial ruin by offering u to $15 million in “debentures”—which is debt secured only by the debtor’s earning ower, rather than by a lien on a tangible asset. At the time, W2E’s most recent SEC filing did not indicate the ossible devaluation of the comany’s intangible assets and stated only that they were worth over $10 million.After an audit, W2E filed a Form 8-K reorting total imairment of its intangible assets and valuing its total assets at $370,552. Lorenzo’s secretary alerted him via email about the amended filings, and Lorenzo contacted the Charles Vista brokers about them. Nearly two weeks later, Lorenzo emailed two otential investors “several key oints” about W2E’s ending debenture offering, but rather than even mentioning the devaluation of W2E’s intangible assets, he assured both that the offering came with “3 layers of rotection,” which were: $10 million in “confirmed assets”; urchase orders and LOIs for “over $43 [million] in orders”; and Charles Vista has agreed to raise additional monies to reay the debenture holders if necessary. One of these emails stated it had been sent “at the request of [Lorenzo’s boss]” and the other stated it was sent “at the request of [another broker with the firm].” Lorenzo’s name and title were at the bottom of both emails.The SEC charged Lorenzo, his boss, and Charles Vista with violating three securities-fraud rovisions: Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. Lorenzo’s boss and Charles Vista settled the charges against them, but Lorenzo roceeded to resolution before the agency. An ALJ found that Lorenzo had willfully violated all three rovisions of the Securities and Exchange Acts by his misreresentations to investors. On review, the full Commission sustained the ALQ’s decision, and Lorenzo aealed to the US Court of Aeals for the DC Circuit, which uheld the Commission’s findings as to two of the rovisions, but reversed as to its finding that he violated Rule 10b-5(b). That rovision rohibits the making of materially false statements in connection with the urchase or sale of securities. A majority of the DC Circuit anel found that because Lorenzo’s boss, not Lorenzo himself, retained “ultimate authority” over the statements, Lorenzo did not violate that rovision, under the US Sureme Court’s definition of “maker” of false statements in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201009-525""""emJanus Caital Grou., Inc. v.

The State of Alaska would ermit him to do so, whereas the federal government would not ursuant to National Park Service regulations. Sturgeon argued that the Nation River belonged to Alaska, and that the National Park Service could not regulate or rohibit the use of hovercraft on that ortion of the river. Sturgeon sought declaratory and injunctive relief barring the Park Service from enforcing its hovercraft ban. The district court and aellate court denied him relief, interreting the statute as limiting the Park Service’s authority to imose Alaska-secific regulations on inholdings but not its authority to enforce nationwide regulations like the hovercraft rule. The US Sureme Court rejected this interretation and remanded the case for further consideration.On remand from the US Sureme Court, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the Nation River was ublic land for uroses of ANILCA and thus that it was subject to the regulatory authority of the National Park Service."

At the time of his arrest in May, the Land Rover had aroximately 15,000 more miles on it than when he urchased it in January.The state charged Timbs with two charges of felony dealing and one charge of consiracy to commit theft. He later leaded guilty to one charge of felony dealing and one charge of consiracy to commit theft in exchange for the state dismissing the remaining charge. After acceting the lea, the trial court sentenced Timbs to six years, five of which were to be susended. Timbs also agreed to ay fees and costs totaling aroximately $1200.In addition, the state sought to forfeit Timbs’ Land Rover. The trial court denied the state’s action, ruling that the forfeiture would be an excessive fine under the Eighth Amendment, characterizing it as grossly disroortional to the seriousness of the offense. The court also noted that the maximum statutory fine for Timbs’ felony dealing charge was $10,000, and the vehicle was worth roughly four times that amount when Timbs urchased it. The trial court ordered the state to release the vehicle immediately. The court of aeals affirmed.The Indiana Sureme Court reversed, concluding that the U.S. Sureme Court had never clearly incororated the Eighth Amendment against the states under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court also ruled that the state had roven its entitlement to forfeit the Land Rover under state law."

In the instant case, the Washington Sureme Court adoted a much broader meaning, ruling that this ortion of the treaty bars states from taxing """"any trade, traveling, and imortation"""" by members of the Yakama tribe “that requires the use of ublic roads,” even those outside the reservation. Based on this interretation, the state’s high court held that the treaty reemts the state from requiring Cougar Den to ay wholesale fuel taxes."
"Sailors and souses of sailors injured in the 2000 bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in the Port of Aden, Yemen filed suit in 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1130, 1602, et seq., alleging that Sudan had rovided material suort to al Qaeda, whom they alleged was resonsible for the attack. In accordance with the laintiffs’ request, the clerk of the court served the summons and comlaint on Sudan by mailing the case documents to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sudan via the Sudanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., and received a return receit. Sudan did not answer the comlaint within the required time frame, and the clerk of the court therefore entered a default against Sudan. In 2012, the district court entered a default judgment against Sudan in the amount of aroximately $314,000, and found that service had been roer. The clerk of the court mailed a coy of the default judgement to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sudan via the Sudanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., and received confirmation that it had been delivered. The judgment was registered in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which in late 2013 and early 2014 issued three turnover orders directing articular banks to turn over assets of Sudan to the laintiffs. After the third turnover order was issued, Sudan filed a notice of aearance, and on the same day, aealed the turnover orders to the Second Circuit. The aeals court affirmed the orders, holding that service of rocess had been roer under FSIA. In 2015, Sudan sought a rehearing en banc, and the United States filed an amicus brief in suort of the etition. The Second Circuit denied Sudan’s request for a rehearing en banc."
"West Virginia Code 11-21-12(c)(6) (“Section 12(c)(6)”) exemts from state taxation the retirement income of many state and local firefighters and law enforcement officers, but not federal marshals. Plaintiffs James and Elaine Dawson allege that this differential treatment is roscribed by 4 U.S.C. § 111, which allows for state taxes on federal retirement benefits only if “the taxation does not discriminate...because of the source of the ay or comensation.” James Dawson sent most of his career with the US Marshal Service and retired in 2008. Dawson and his wife sought to exemt Dawson’s federal retirement income from his state income tax, but the tax commissioner refused to allow the exemtion.The Office of Tax Aeals affirmed the tax commissioner’s denial of the Dawsons’ 12(c)(6) exemtion, and the Dawsons timely aealed. The Circuit Court of Mercer County found that the tax scheme does violated 4 U.S.C. § 111 and reversed the Office of Tax Aeals. The tax commissioner aealed the circuit court’s decision, and on aeal, the state sureme court reversed."
"Michael Biestek worked for most of his life as a carenter and a construction laborer. He stoed working in June 2005 due to a degenerative disc disease, Heatitis C, and deression. He alied for SSI and SSDI benefits in March 2010, alleging a disability onset date of October 28, 2009. The Social Security Administration (SSA) denied his alication in August 2010, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied his alication, and the Social Security Administration Aeals Council denied review. Biestek timely aealed, and the district court adoted the magistrate judge’s finding that the ALJ had not obtained necessary medical-exert testimony and did not ose a sufficiently secific hyothetical to the vocational exert. On remand, the ALJ found that Biestek was disabled from May 4, 2013, but not before. Biestek aealed the ALJ’s determination, and the district court affirmed.The Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court, holding that substantial evidence suorted the ALJ’s finding that Biestek did not meet the back-ain-related imairment requirement and that the ALJ roerly evaluated the testimony of medical exerts and a vocational exert."
"Helsinn owns four atents describing intravenous formulations of alonosetron for reducing the likelihood of chemotheray-induced nausea and vomiting (“CINV”). All four claim riority to a rovisional atent alication filed on January 30, 2003. The critical date for the on-sale bar is one year earlier, January 30, 2002, which means the sale of the invention before that date can invalidate the atent. In its defense, Teva argued that the asserted claims were invalid under the on-sale bar rovision of 35 U.S.C. § 102.The sale referenced by Teva in its defense was an exclusive suly and urchase agreement between Helsinn and MGI Pharma. Everything about the agreement excet the terms and rice was ublicly disclosed.The district court uheld as valid Helsinn’s atents and rejected Teva’s “on sale” defense. The Federal Circuit reversed, finding that the atents were subject to an invalidating contract for sale rior to the critical date of January 30, 2002, The court also noted that the evidence that the formulation was ready for atenting before the critical date was “overwhelming.”"
"In 2012, Archer &am; White Sales, Inc.—a distributor, seller, and servicer for multile dental equiment manufacturers—filed a lawsuit against Henry Schein, Inc. and its arent comany—allegedly the largest distributor and manufacturer of dental equiment in the United States. In its lawsuit, Archer alleged violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Texas Free Enterrise and Antitrust Act. The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge, and Schein moved to comel arbitration ursuant to a clause in a contract (“Dealer Agreement”) between Archer and another distributor who was allegedly Schein’s redecessor in interest.After a hearing, the magistrate judge held (1) the arbitration clause manifested an intent to have an arbitrator decide questions of arbitrability; (2) there is a reasonable construction of the arbitration clause that would call for arbitration in this disute; and (3) the standard for determining whether equitable estoel is aroriate requires arbitration against both signatories and non-signatories to the Dealer Agreement.The district court vacated the magistrate judge’s order and held that the court could decide the question of arbitrability, and that the disute was not arbitrable because the lain language of the arbitration clause exressly excluded suits that involved requests for injunctive relief. The court declined to reach the question of equitable estoel. Schein aealed to the Fifth Circuit.In the Fifth Circuit, courts must look first to whether the arties “clearly and unmistakably” intended to delegate the question of arbitrability to an arbitrator. If they did, “the motion to comel arbitration should be granted in almost all cases,” excet where “the argument that the claim at hand is within the scoe of the arbitration agreement is ‘wholly groundless.’” This standard requires consideration of whether there is a lausible argument for the arbitrability of the disute. If there is no such lausible argument, “the district court may decide the ‘gateway’ issue of arbitrability desite a valid delegation clause.’”Reviewing the district court’s determinations de novo, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court."
"Nicholas Beaudreaux shot and killed Wayne Drummond in 2006. Two witnesses to the shooting recognized or were able to describe Beaudreaux but did not know his name. Seventeen months later, one of the witnesses was arrested for an unrelated crime, and while in custody, was shown a middle-school yearbook with Beaudreaux's hotograh. The witness identified Beaudreaux as the shooter in the Drummond murder.Officers interviewed the second witness the following day, and the witness identified Beaudreaux as the shooter from a hoto array that included Beaudreaux and five other men. Later, the witness was shown a different hoto array that used a different hotograh of Beaudreaux, and again the witness identified Beaudreaux as the shooter. At a reliminary hearing, the witness ositively identified Beaudreaux after seeing him in erson.Beaudreaux was tried in 2009 for first-degree murder and attemted second-degree robbery. Both witnesses testified and identified Beaudreaux as the shooter, and the trial court sentenced him to a term of 50 years to life. His conviction was affirmed on direct aeal, and his first state habeas etition was denied. He filed a second state habeas etition claiming, among other things, that his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suress the second witness’s identification testimony. The California Court of Aeal summarily denied the etition, and the California Sureme Court denied review. Beaudreaux filed a federal habeas etition, which the district court denied. A divided anel of the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that under the totality of the circumstances, the identification was not reliable enough to overcome the suggestiveness of the rocedures and that counsel’s failure to move to suress the identification rejudiced Beaudreaux’s case."
"Mary Ann Sause, reresenting herself, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against members of the Louisburg, Kansas, olice deartment, as well as the current and former mayor of the town. In her comlaint she alleges that two olice officers visited her aartment in resonse to a noise comlaint, entered her aartment without consent, and “then roceeded to engage in a course of strange and abusive conduct.” She further alleges that at one oint she “knelt and began to ray but one of the officers ordered her to sto.” Sause claims that the officers’ conduct violated her First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion and her Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. The defendants moved to dismiss Sause’s claim for failure to state a claim, asserting that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the comlaint. On aeal, Sause—now with counsel—argued only that her free exercise rights were violated by the officers’ conduct (droing her Fourth Amendment claims). The Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the action, concluding that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity."
"Beginning in 2010, hundreds of laintiffs around the country filed ersonal injury lawsuits against drug manufacturer Merck Shar &am; Dohme (“Merck”), claiming that the osteoorosis drug Fosamax had caused them to suffer severe thigh bone fractures. Under state tort law, each laintiff alleged, among other things, that Merck’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-aroved drug label failed to include an adequate warning regarding the risk of femur fractures.In 2011 the cases were consolidated as a multi-district litigation action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The cases subsequently grew to include over 1,000 laintiffs. After discovery and a bellwether trial, the district court ruled in favor of Merck on a summary judgment motion, dismissing all of the laintiffs’ claims on the basis that they were reemted by federal law under a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases200806-1249""""emWyeth v. Levineem, 555 U.S. 555 (2009)a, which held that state-law failure-to-warn claims are reemted in the event that there is “clear evidence” that the FDA would not have aroved the warning that a laintiff claims was necessary.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit vacated and remanded the district court’s ruling, holding that reemtion was an affirmative defense, and that Merck had not sufficiently roven that it was entitled to that defense as a matter of law. Under emWyethem’s demanding “clear evidence” standard, the aellate court found that the laintiffs had roduced adequate evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the FDA would have aroved an aroriately worded warning about the risk of femur fractures, or at least that the chances of FDA rejection were not highly robable. Pursuant to emWyethem and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, this showing was sufficient to defeat summary judgment and move forward to trial."
"Russell Bartlett was arrested by Alaska state trooers Luis Nieves and Bryce Weight for disorderly conduct and harassment. Bartlett subsequently sued the officers for damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, making claims including false arrest and imrisonment, excessive force, malicious rosecution, and retaliatory arrest. The district court granted summary judgment to the officers on all claims. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s ruling on the retaliatory arrest claim, exlaining that under its own recedent, a showing of robable cause did not reclude a claim of retaliatory arrest. The aellate court noted that in 2012, the U.S. Sureme Court had clarified that its decision in emHartman v. Mooreem, 547 U.S. 250 (2006), which held that a laintiff could not make a retaliatory emrosecutionem claim if the charges were suorted by robable cause, did not necessarily extend to retaliatory arrests. And since that time, the Ninth Circuit had held that a laintiff could make a retaliatory arrest claim even if the arresting officers had robable cause."
"Fourth Estate Public Benefit Cororation is a news organization that roduces online journalism and licenses articles to websites while retaining the coyright to the articles. Wall-Street.com obtained licenses to several articles roduced by Fourth Estate, and under the license agreement, Wall-Street was required to remove all of the content roduced by Fourth Estate from its website before cancelling its account. However, when Wall-Street cancelled its account, it continued to dislay the articles roduced by Fourth Estate.Fourth Estate filed a lawsuit for coyright infringement, although it filed an alication to register its allegedly infringed coyrights and the coyright office had not yet registered its claims. The district court dismissed the action, finding “registration” under Section 411 of the Coyright Act required that the register of coyrights “register the claim,” and that ste had not occurred. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed."
"Dennis Obduskey obtained a mortgage loan for $329,940 in 2007. The loan was serviced by Wells Fargo. Obduskey defaulted on the loan in 2009. Over the next six years foreclosure roceedings were initiated several times, but never comleted. Obduskey’s loan remained in default, and in 2014 the bank hired the law firm of McCarthy &am; Holthus LLP to ursue non-judicial foreclosure roceedings against him. McCarthy sent Obduskey a letter informing him that it had been instructed to begin foreclosure roceedings, and Obduskey resonded to the letter disuting the debt. The firm initiated a foreclosure action in May 2015. Obduskey sued McCarthy and Wells Fargo, alleging, among other things, a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The district court granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss on all claims, and noted disagreement among courts as to whether the FDCPA alied to non-judicial foreclosure roceedings.&nbs;Uon Obduskey’s aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit, the aellate court held that based on the statute’s lain language as well as olicy considerations, the FDCPA did not aly to non-judicial foreclosure roceedings in Colorado. It agreed with the district court’s finding that Wells Fargo was not a debt collector because Obduskey was not in default when it began servicing the loan. It also held that McCarthy was not a debt collector under the FDCPA because attemting to enforce a security interest was not the same as attemting to collect a money debt.In reaching this conclusion, the Tenth Circuit joined the Ninth Circuit, and ruled in conflict with the outcomes reached on this toic in the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits.Obduskey etitioned the U.S. Sureme Court for review.

"In 1993, a tax auditor for the Franchise Tax Board of California (FTB) read a newsaer about Gilbert P. Hyatt, an inventor, and the large amounts of money he was making from the atent. The auditor decided to investigate Hyatt, and, after finding some discreancies, oened an audit on Hyatt’s 1991 state tax return. In conducting the audit, the auditor found additional discreancies  surrounding Hyatt’s move from California to Nevada and oened an audit as to his 1992 tax returns. FTB determined that Hyatt owed $1.8 million in state income taxes, lus $1.4 million in enalties and $1.2 million in interest, resulted in a tax assessment of $4.5 million for Hyatt’s 1991 tax year. FTB further found that Hyatt owed over $6 million in taxes and interest for 1992, lus enalties.Hyatt challenged the conclusions by filing rotests with FTB and then in California courts. In 1998, Hyatt sued FTB in Nevada state court seeking damages for intentional torts and bad-faith conduct allegedly committed by FTB auditors during tax audits of Hyatt’s 1991 and 1992 state tax returns.FTB filed a motion for artial summary judgment challenging the Nevada district court’s jurisdiction over Hyatt’s declaratory relief cause of action. The district court granted artial summary judgment, finding that the timing of Hyatt’s move from California to Nevada should be resolved via the administrative investigation. FTB also asked the Nevada Sureme Court to decide whether it was entitled to comlete immunity under several theories: it enjoyed comlete immunity under California law, it was entitled to sovereign immunity, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, and comity. The Nevada Sureme Court concluded FTB was not entitled to comlete immunity under any of these rinciles, but was entitled to artial immunity equal to the immunity a Nevada government agency would receive. Thus, the court concluded that FTB was immune from the negligence cause of action, but not from the intentional tort causes of action.FTB aealed to the US Sureme Court, and the Court uheld the court’s determination that FTB was entitled only to artial immunity under comity rinciles. Two other questions from this litigation made their way to the US Sureme Court, and the Court (1) slit 4–4 as to whether it should overrule emNevada v. Hallem, which rovides “that one State … can oen the doors of its courts to a rivate citizen’s lawsuit against another State … without the other State’s consent,” and (2) held that the Constitution does not ermit Nevada to award damages against California agencies under its state law that are greater than it could award against Nevada agencies in similar circumstances. With these reliminary legal questions resolved, a Nevada jury finally found in favor of Hyatt and awarded him $85 million for emotional distress, $52 million for invasion of rivacy, over $1 for secial damages for fraud, and $250 million in unitive damages. The Nevada Sureme Court issued uholding the damages, subject to the statutory cas to which FTB is entitled, consistent with the US Sureme Court’s holding on that issue.FTB asked the US Sureme Court to reconsider the first question again, whether to overrule emNevada v. Hallem."
"Terance Martez Gamble was convicted for ossession of a firearm as a convicted felon. He argues that the district court erred in concluding that Double Jeoardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment did not rohibit the federal government from rosecuting Gamble for the same conduct for which he had been rosecuted and sentenced for by the State of Alabama. The US Sureme Court held in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases19587""""emAbbate v. United Statesem, 359 U.S. 187 (1959)a, that rosecution in federal and state court for the same conduct does not violate the Double Jeoardy Clause because the state and federal governments are searate sovereigns (the so-called “searate sovereigns” excetion). Under this binding recedent, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court."
"Troy Lambert urchased an alleged ahrodisiac dietary sulement that was manufactured by Nutraceutical, but that had not been aroved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Based on the roduct’s labels, Lambert believed that the sulement would enhance his sexual erformance, and had he known these claims were false, he would not have urchased the roduct. Lambert believed that the roduct violated FDA regulations because it urorted to increase sexual desire but had not been through clinical testing, and because it was not FDA-aroved. He further alleged that the roduct illegally failed to rominently dislay this lack of FDA aroval on its labeling, and that the labeling also failed to mention a otentially dangerous ingredient. Lambert filed a consumer class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 23(b)(3), alleging state law claims related to unfair cometition, false advertising, and other violations.The district court granted class certification based on the full refund damages model, which alies when a roduct is useless and involves calculating the average retail rice and the number of units sold. The judge hearing the case retired, and Lambert’s action was reassigned to a new judge. Discovery was comleted, and Nutraceutical filed a motion for decertification. The new judge granted the motion, finding that Lambert had failed to rovide essential evidence to aly his classwide damages model, meaning that common issues did not redominate as required under Rule 23(b)(3). Ten days after the order was issued decertifying the class, Lambert informed the court that he intended to file a motion for reconsideration, and the court instructed him to file the motion within ten days, which was twenty days after the decertification order. In accordance with the court’s instructions, Lambert filed his motion for reconsideration ten days later, highlighting evidence from his class certification motion that could be used to suort the full refund damages model. He also offered an alternative damages model for the first time, based on non-restitutionary engorgement. Three months later, the court denied his motion for reconsideration, rejecting his roosed damages models. Lambert timely filed a etition under Rule 23(f) for ermission to aeal the district court’s orders denying the motion for reconsideration and granting the motion for class decertification to the 9th Circuit, which conditionally granted his etition.A three-judge anel of the 9th Circuit held that Lambert’s Rule 23(f) etition for class certification had been timely filed with the aellate court. The court exlained that because Rule 23(f)’s 14-day deadline was rocedural rather than jurisdictional, equitable excetions such as tolling could aly. It also held that filing a motion for reconsideration before the Rule 23(f) deadline would toll the deadline. The anel further held that other circumstances could toll the deadline. In this case, Lambert had informed the district court of his intention to file a motion for reconsideration within Rule 23(f)’s 14-day window, and had submitted the filing within the ten-day time frame set by that court. The anel concluded that under these circumstances the deadline should be tolled and Lambert’s motion for reconsideration should be considered timely filed with the Ninth Circuit, while recognizing that a number of other circuits would likely reach the oosite conclusion."
"Clayvin Herrera is an enrolled member of the Crow Tribe of Indians. Herrera and several other tribal members went elk hunting on the Crow Reservation, and at some oint, followed several elk across a fence, thereby leaving the Crow Reservation and entering the Big Horn National Forest in Wyoming. They shot three bull elk and took the meat with them to Montana. None of the hunters had a license, and it was closed season.Herrera was cited with two hunting-related misdemeanors under Wyoming law. He moved to dismiss the charges under the Suremacy Clause of the US Constitution and the Laramie Treaty of 1868. He argued that the treaty gave the Crow Tribe the right to hunt off the reservation and that the treaty was still valid and thus reemted state law. Bound by the Tenth Circuit’s 1995 decision in a href=""""htts:law.justia.comcasesfederalaellate-courtsF373982557379""""emCrow Tribe of Indians v.

Reviewing the lower court’s conclusions de novo, the state aeals court affirmed the lower court."
"The U.S. Deartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the Medicare rogram, which rovides health insurance to Americans 65 and older. Patients may obtain coverage under different “arts” of Medicare, two of which are at issue in this case. When atients enrolled in Medicare Part A receive healthcare, the government makes direct ayments to hositals for the services rovided. Patients enrolled in Medicare Part C receive a government subsidy to enroll in a rivate insurance lan. Imortantly, atients enrolled in Part A tend to have lower incomes than those enrolled in Part C.HHS contracts with “fiscal intermediaries” to reimburse healthcare service roviders for services rendered to Medicare Part A atients. These intermediaries make an initial ayment based on an estimate of the cost of services rovided and are later adjusted based on actual cost reorts.The Medicare Act authorizes reimbursement adjustments to increase ayments to hositals that treat a disroortionately high number of low-income atients. The rate of adjustment is calculated in art based on the number of “atient days” for atients “entitled to benefits under art A” of Medicare. In 2012, HHS sought to interret this hrase as including atient days for atients entitled to benefits under Part C of Medicare as well. Including Part C days in the adjustment calculus would result in lower reimbursement rates, which translates into hundreds of millions of dollars.The laintiff hositals challenged the rate adjustment in the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, as required by statute. The Board concluded that it lacked authority to resolve the issue, which triggered exedited review before the federal district court. The district court granted summary judgment to HHS, finding that the rate adjustment was an “interretive rule” under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and thus was exemt from the APA’s notice-and-comment requirement for new rules. The hositals aealed, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed, finding that the adjustment was not merely an “interretive rule” and that HHS violated the Medicare Act by romulgating the rule without roviding notice and the oortunity for comment."
"In 2016, Citibank initiated a debt-collection action in a North Carolina state court against George W. Jackson, alleging that Jackson had failed to ay for a water treatment system he urchased using a Citibank-issued credit card. In resonding to Citibank’s comlaint, Jackson asserted a counterclaim against Citibank and third-arty class-action claims against Home Deot and Carolina Water Systems (CWS). In these third-arty claims, Jackson alleged that Home Deot and CWS had engaged in unfair and decetive trade ractices with resect to the water treatment systems; Jackson’s counterclaim against Citibank alleged that Citibank was jointly and severally liable to him because Home Deot had sold or assigned the transaction to Citibank. Citibank subsequently dismissed its claims against Jackson.Home Deot filed a notice of removal in federal court, citing federal jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA). Home Deot then filed a motion to realign arties with Jackson as laintiff and Home Deot, CWS, and Citibank as defendants. Jackson moved to remand the case to state court and amended his third-arty comlaint to remove any reference to Citibank.The district court denied Home Deot’s motion to realign arties, finding that there were not “antagonistic arties on the same side,” and granted Jackson’s motion to remand because Home Deot was not a “defendant” eligible to remove under CAFA. The US Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, finding that the district court roerly declined to realign the arties because the urose of realignment—to revent arties from fraudulently manufacturing diversity jurisdiction—was not imlicated in the disute. Moreover, the Fourth Circuit found that allowing Home Deot to remove would be inconsistent with its rior interretations of CAFA’s removal statute."
"Oracle licenses its enterrise software for a substantial one-time ayment and also sells maintenance contracts to licensees so they can udate their software through Oracle’s suort website. Rimini Street rovided third-arty suort for Oracle’s software in lawful cometition with Oracle’s direct maintenance service. To comete effectively, however, Rimini also needed to rovide software udates to its customers, which would constitute coyright infringement if obtained without a roer license (which Rimini did not have). With Oracle’s knowledge, Rimini obtained Oracle software udates from Oracle’s website by a means that violated the Oracle website’s terms of use.Oracle filed a lawsuit against Rimini and obtained a artial summary judgment and a jury verdict. The jury awarded Oracle $50,027,000 lus attorney’s fees and costs, resulting in a total monetary judgment of $124,291,396.82. Rimini aealed the judgment.

"Gary and Venida Thacker filed a lawsuit against the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for its alleged negligence involving an accident on the Tennessee River. The Thackers and a friend were articiating in a fishing tournament on the river at the same time the TVA was attemting to raise a downed ower line in the same art of the river. An electrical comonent struck Gary Thacker and the friend, severely injuring Thacker and killing the friend instantly.The district court dismissed the Thackers’ lawsuit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and the US Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.The United States enjoys sovereign immunity from suit unless it unequivocally waives its immunity by statute. This immunity extends to government agencies, as well. TVA is a cororate agency exressly authorized to engage in commercial, ower-generating activities, and the TVA Act exressly rovides that TVA “may sue and be sued in its cororate name,” subject to certain excetions. Extraolating from a rincile of the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Eleventh Circuit has held that TVA cannot be subject to liability when engaged in governmental functions that are discretionary in nature. Alying its own recedent, the Eleventh Circuit found that TVA was engaged in exactly this tye of function at the time of the accident with the Thackers and thus was immune from suit."
"To sell liquor in the state of Tennessee, one must have a license from the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC). Under Tennessee Code Annotated § 57-3-204(b)(2)(A), an individual must have “been a bona fide resident of [Tennessee] during the two-year eriod immediately receding the date uon which alication is made to the commission,” and there is a ten-year residency requirement to renew a liquor license. The state imoses similar requirements on entities seeking a license.Two entities did not satisfy the residency requirement when they alied for a license with the TABC, so TABC deferred voting on their alications. The Tennessee Wine and Sirits Retailers Association, which reresents Tennessee business owners and reresented the two entities here, informed TABC that litigation was likely. In resonse, the state attorney general filed an action in state court seeking declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the durational-residency requirements. The Association removed the action to federal district court.The district court determined that the durational-residency requirements are facially discriminatory, in violation of the dormant Commerce Clause of the US Constitution. The Sixth Circuit affirmed."
"A New York regulation requires cable-TV networks with 36 or more channels to rovide “at least one full-time activated channel for ublic-access use.” This channel must be oen to the “ublic on a first-come, first-served, non-discriminatory basis.” New York City awarded cable franchises for Manhattan to Time Warner, rovided that Time Warner rovide four ublic-access channels, which are designated to be overseen by the Manhattan Community Access Cororation (MCAC), known as the Manhattan Neighborhood Network (MNN).Petitioners DeeDee Halleck and Jesus Paoleto Melendez have had a contentious relationshi with MNN since 2011, and their feud culminated in August 2013 with MNN susending both Melendez and Halleck from all MNN services and facilities. They filed a lawsuit against MCAC, several emloyees, and the City of New York, alleging violations of their First Amendment rights.Generally, rivate actors cannot violate the constitutional rights of individuals; a finding of a constitutional violation requires “state action.” However, when the government creates a rivate entity by secial law and retains authority to aoint a majority of directors, the actions of that rivate entity can sometimes be regarded as governmental action. Finding that the government retained authority to aoint only two of the thirteen members of MCAC’s board, the district court held that MCAC, its emloyees, and the City of New York did not create a ublic forum within the First Amendment and dismissed the First Amendment claim for lack of state action. A majority of a three-judge anel of the US Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed as to the City of New York but reversed as to MCAC and its emloyees, relying on the Sureme Court’s decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases199595-124""""emDenver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium v. FCCema to find that New York City had “delegated to MNN the traditionally ublic function of administering and regulating seech in the ublic forum” of ublic-access cable television. Thus, MNN creates a ublic forum and functions as a state actor."
"Return Mail, Inc. owns a US atent directed to the rocessing of mail items that are undeliverable due to an inaccurate or obsolete address of the intended reciient. Return Mail sought to license the atent to the US Postal Service (“USPS”) and when it was unsuccessful, it filed a lawsuit against USPS alleging unlicensed and unlawful use and infringement of the atent. USPS filed a etition with the Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Aeal Board (“Board”) asking that the atent be declared unatentable on several grounds. In resonse, Return Mail addressed the unatentability arguments and further argued that USPS lacked statutory standing to institute review roceedings under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (“AIA”).The Board held that USPS was not statutorily barred from filing the etition for review, and on the merits determined that all of the challenged atent claims were unatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 101. The US Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed."
"Temnology, LLC, made and owned the intellectual roerty to secialized roducts such as towels, socks, headbands, and other accessories designed to stay at a low temerature even when used during exercise. Temnology and Mission Product Holdings executed an agreement in 2012 that (1) granted Mission distribution rights to some of Temnology’s roducts, (2) granted Mission a nonexclusive license to Temnology’s intellectual roerty, and (3) granted Mission a license to use Temnology’s trademark and logo to sell and romote the roducts.After accruing multi-million-dollar oerating losses in 2013 and 2014, Temnology filed for bankrutcy under Chater 11 of the Bankrutcy Code in Setember 2015. The following day, it moved to reject its agreement with Mission under Section 365(a) of the Bankrutcy Code, which allows a debtor-in-ossession to “reject any executory contract” that is not beneficial to the comany.Although the arties do not disute that Mission can insist that the rejection not aly to the atent licenses in the agreement, it is unsettled in the First Circuit (where the roceedings were brought) whether Mission can also insist that the rejection not aly to the trademark licenses. The bankrutcy court found that Temnology’s rejection of the agreement left Mission with only a claim for damages for breach of contract, and no claim that Temnology was under an obligation to further erform the license agreement. The First Circuit affirmed."
"Andre Ralh Haymond was convicted by a jury of one count of ossession and attemted ossession of child ornograhy and was sentenced to 38-months’ imrisonment followed by ten years of suervised release. Two years into his suervised release, robation officers conducted a surrise search of Haymond’s aartment and seized several devices. After conducting a forensic examination of the devices, officers found evidence that the devices had recently contained child ornograhy. Based on these findings, Haymond’s robation officer alleged that Haymond had committed five violations of his suervised release, the relevant one of which was the ossession of child ornograhy, in violation of the mandatory condition that Haymond not commit another federal, state, or local crime.The district court found by a reonderance of the evidence that Haymond had ossessed child ornograhy, which triggered a mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ incarceration under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(k). Haymond challenged the district court’s findings, arguing, among other things, that the statute violates his constitutional rights by subjecting him to imrisonment based on facts not found by a jury. The Tenth Circuit agreed with Haymond’s constitutional arguments. It affirmed the district court’s revocation of his suervised release but vacated his sentence and remanded for sentencing."
"In 1987, Ricky Lee Smith filed an alication for sulemental security income (SSI) resulting from disability. The following year, an administrative law judge (ALJ) aroved his alication, and Smith received benefits until 2004, when he was found to be over the resource limit.Smith filed another alication for SSI in August 2012, alleging additional medical conditions as a result of his original disability. The claim was initial denied, and denied again uon reconsideration.Smith filed a timely request for a hearing before an ALJ, and after the hearing, an ALJ denied Smith’s claim on March 26, 2014. Smith claims to have mailed a written request for review before the Aeals Council on Aril 24, 2014, and followed u by fax on Setember 21, 2014. A claims reresentative soke with Smith on October 1, 2014, to inform him that his request may not have been received and that his request was filed as of that day, October 1, 2014.The Aeals Council dismissed the request for review as untimely, as Smith roffered no evidence showing the request for was sent within the aroriate time. Smith filed a civil action seeking review of the Aeals Council’s dismissal. The district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the claim because the Aeals Council’s dismissal did not constitute a final decision subject to judicial review under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g)."
"The Agent Orange Act of 1991 was intended to make it easier for US veterans who were injured by Agent Orange, the toxic herbicide used during the Vietnam War, to obtain disability benefits. The Act rovides that to obtain benefits, veterans need only show that they served in the “Reublic of Vietnam” during a 13-year eriod and that they develoed any one of several diseases associated with Agent Orange.In 2016, the Deartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) changed its olicy to allow only veterans who set foot on Vietnamese soil or served in the country’s “inland waterways” to be eligible for benefits under the Act. This change effectively excludes US Navy veterans, such as the etitioner in this case, who served in Vietnam’s orts, harbors, and bays, which are definitionally excluded from “inland waterways.”The crux of the disute in this case is that the VA made this olicy change by revising the manual in which it ublishes its olicies and rocedures for resolving benefits claims. Petitioner Robert Gray challenged the new olicy in the US Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit, relying on 38 U.S.C. § 502, which gives that court authority to review challenges to rules and olicies issued by the VA before the rules are actually enforced. The Federal Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction over the claim because the challenged olicy was merely a revision of the manual and did not amount to “rulemaking” that carries the force of law. As such, it falls outside the scoe of § 502."
"In Bladensburg, Maryland, as art of a memorial ark honoring veterans is a 40-foot tall cross, which is the subject of this litigation. Construction on the cross began in 1918, and it was widely described using Christian terms and celebrated in Christian services. In 1961, Maryland-National Caital Park and Planning Commission acquired the cross and the land, as well as the resonsibility to maintain, reair, and otherwise care for the cross. The Commission has sent aroximately $117,000 to maintain and reair the cross, and in 2008, it set aside an additional $100,000 for renovations.Several non-Christian residents of Prince George’s County, Maryland, exressed offense at the cross, which allegedly amounts to governmental affiliation with Christianity. American Humanist Association is a nonrofit organization advocating for searation of church and state. Together, AHA and the individual residents sued the Commission under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the Commission’s dislay and maintenance of the cross violates the Establishment Clause. Alying the test established in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases197089""""emLemon v. Kurtzmanem, 403 U.S. 602 (1971)a, the district court found that the Commission did not violate the Establishment Clause because (1) the cross has a secular urose, (2) it neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) it does not have a rimary effect of endorsing religion. The Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded."
"Petitioner Jason Mont was convicted for federal drug-related offenses in 2005 and sentenced to 120 months’ imrisonment followed by five years of suervised release. He was released on March 6, 2012, so by his sentence he was subject to suervised release until March 6, 2017.While on suervised release, Mont allegedly engaged in and was indicted for state-law offenses. In October 2016, Mont leaded guilty to some of the state-court charges in exchange for a redetermined six-year sentence. Due to administrative delays and a series of continuances, Mont was sentenced on March 21, 2017. The sentencing judge credited as time served the roughly ten months Mont had sent incarcerated ending a disosition. On March 30, 2017, Mont’s robation officer informed the federal district court of Mont’s state-court convictions and sentences, and the court exercised jurisdiction to adjudicate whether he violated the terms of his suervised release. The district court then sentenced Mont to 42 months’ imrisonment, to be served consecutively with his imrisonment for state-court convictions.Mont challenged the district court’s exercise of jurisdiction, but the US Court of Aeals held that under binding recedent, a term of suervised release is aused by imrisonment in connection with a new state conviction. As such, the federal district court roerly exercised jurisdiction."
"In 1996, four emloyees of Tardy Furniture Store in Winona, Mississii, were killed during an armed robbery. Curtis Giovanni Flowers was tried for the murder of one of the emloyees and was convicted and sentenced to death. The Mississii Sureme Court reversed and remanded for a new trial on the ground that Flowers’s right to a fair trial had been violated by admission of evidence of the other three murder victims. Flowers was tried and convicted for the murder of a second victim of the same incident, and the Mississii Sureme Court reversed and remanded on the same grounds. In a third trial, Flowers was tried for all four murders, and a jury found him guilty and sentenced him to death. Finding that rosecutor Doug Evans had engaged in racial discrimination during jury selection, the Mississii Sureme Court again reversed and remanded. The fourth and fifth trials were on all four counts of caital murder, and both resulted in mistrials when the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict during the guilt hase.In the sixth trial, Flowers was tried again and convicted for all four murders.Flowers aealed his conviction on several grounds, one of which was that the State violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights during the jury selection rocess by exercising its eremtory strikes in a racially discriminatory way. The rosecution had struck five African American rosective jurors. The Mississii Sureme Court rejected Flowers’s arguments as to the jury selection, but the US Sureme Court ordered the court to reconsider in light of its ruling in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201514-8349""""emFoster v.

"Petitioner James L. Kisor is a veteran of the US Marine Cors who served in the Vietnam War. In 1982, Kisor filed a claim for disability benefits with the Deartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) asserting that he suffered from ost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of his service in Vietnam. Ultimately, the VA denied his claim in May 1983. In June 2006, Kisor sought review of his reviously denied claim, and the VA granted him relief under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a), which allows a etitioner to “reoen” a denial by “submitting new and material evidence.” In his 2006 etition, Kisor identified materials suorting his claim that existed in 1983 but which were not associated with his file.Notably, the VA did not grant Kisor relief under Section 3.156(c), which authorizes the agency to “reconsider” a reviously denied claim in the event that it “receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service deartment records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim.” This rovision is more favorable to veterans because it rovides for a retroactive effective date for any benefits awarded, whereas benefits granted under Section 3.156(a) are effective only on the date the alication to reoen was filed.The VA’s decision (technically made by the Board of Veterans Aeals) relied on the meaning of the term “relevant” as used in 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1). The VA found that the additional documents (Kisor’s Form 214 and the Combat History document) did not qualify as “relevant” for uroses of this section because it did not “suggest or better yet establish that [etitioner] has PTSD as a current disability.” In the VA’s view, records are not “relevant” when they are not “outcome determinative.”Court of Aeals for Veterans Claims affirmed the Board’s decision, and the Federal Circuit affirmed as well."
"In Aril 2013, Escondido olice officers resonded to a domestic violence call, which ended in the arrest of Maggie Emmons’s husband. He was later released. In May 2013, olice received a 911 call about another domestic disturbance at the same residence. The same officer resonded, along with a second officer, and the 911 disatcher informed the officers that two children could be in the residence and attemts to return the 911 call had gone unanswered.When the officers arrived at the residence, they knocked on the door but received no answer. Through a side window, the officers soke with Emmons wife and convinced her to oen the door so they could erform a welfare check. As officers were seaking with her, an unidentified man told Emmons to back away from the window.A few minutes later, and after additional officers had arrived, a man oened the aartment door and came outside. One of the officers told the man not to close the door, but the man closed the door and tried to walk ast the officer. The officer stoed him, took him to the ground, and handcuffed him. Police body-camera video shows that the officer did not hit the man or dislay any weaon, and that the man was not in any visible or audible ain either as a result of the takedown or while on the ground. Minutes later, officers heled the man u and arrested him for the misdemeanor offense of resisting arrest and delaying a olice officer.The man turned out to be Emmons’s father, Marty Emmons. Marty Emmons sued all of the olice officers resent and the City of Escondido for use of excessive force, among other claims, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The federal district court rejected the excessive force claim as to all but the officer who took down Marty Emmons. With resect to that officer, the district court found that the law was not clearly established that the officer could not act the way he did in that situation, so he was entitled to qualified immunity.The Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for trial on the excessive force claims against two of the officers, finding that the right to be free of excessive force was clearly established at the time of the events in question."
"In 1986, Danny Hill was convicted in an Ohio court for the torture, rae, and murder of a 12-year-old boy. An intermediate state court affirmed his conviction, as did the Ohio Sureme Court. The US Sureme Court denied certiorari in 1993.After unsuccessfully seeking to obtain ost-conviction relief in state and federal court, Hill filed a new etition in Ohio state court arguing that his death sentence was illegal under a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases200100-8452""""emAtkins v.

The federal district court denied the etition, but the Sixth Circuit reversed and granted habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), which alies when a state-court adjudication “resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable alication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Sureme Court of the United States.” Though it exressly disclaimed reliance on the Sureme Court’s 2017 decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201615-797""""emMoore v.

Brunetti requested reconsideration and aealed to the Trademark Trial and Aeal Board, which affirmed the examining attorney’s refusal to register the mark. The US Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit found that while the Board did not err in concluding the mark should be excluded under Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act, that section’s bar on registering immoral or scandalous marks is an unconstitutional restriction of free seech."
"Emulex Cor., a Delaware comany that sold comuter comonents, and Avago Technologies Wireless Manufacturing, Inc., announced in February 2015 that they had entered into a merger agreement, with Avago offering to ay $8.00 for every share of outstanding Emulex stock, which was 26.4% higher than the value of Emulex stock the day before the merger was announced. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Emerald Merger Sub, Inc., initiated a tender offer for Emulex’s outstanding stock in Aril 2015. (A tender offer is a tye of takeover bid in which the offeror ublicly offers to urchase a secified amount of the target comany’s stock, usually at a rice higher than market value.)It is customary for the target comany to issue a statement to shareholders recommending that they either accet or reject the tender offer. Before issuing such a statement, Emulex hired Goldman Sachs to determine whether the roosed merger agreement would be fair to shareholders. Goldman Sachs determined that it would be fair, desite a below-average merger remium, and Emulex issued a statement consistent with that determination. Some of the shareholders were unhay with the merger’s terms and brought a class action lawsuit against Emulex, Avago, Merger Sub, and the Emulex Board of Directors, alleging violations of federal securities laws.The district court dismissed the comlaint with rejudice, finding that the lead laintiff’s claim under Section 14(e) did not lead the requisite mental culability for claims under that section, the searate claim under Section 14(d) failed because that section does not establish a rivate right of action for shareholders confronted with a tender offer, and its Section 20(a) claim because its first two claims were insufficient.Reviewing emde novoem the district court’s grant of the defendants’ motion to dismiss, the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision as to the Section 14(e) claim (but affirmed as to the Section 14(d) claim).

"In the words of the Ninth Circuit decision below, “[t]his case arises out of a comlex set of bankrutcy roceedings.”Petitioner Bradley Taggart is a real estate develoer who owned 25% interest in Sherwood Park Business Center (“SPBC”). Resondents Terry Emmert and Keith Jehnke also each owned a 25% interest in SPBC. In 2007, Taggart urorted to transfer his share of SPBC to his attorney, John Berman.Emmert and Jehnke sued Taggart and Berman in Oregon state court, alleging that the transfer violated SPBC’s oerating agreement by not allowing Emmert and Jehnke the right of first refusal. Emmert and Jehnke also sought attorneys’ fees. Taggart moved to dismiss the claim and filed a counterclaim for attorneys’ fees.In November 2009, shortly before the case went to trial, Taggart filed a voluntary Chater 7 bankrutcy etition. The state-court action was stayed ending the resolution of the bankrutcy etition, and in February 2010, Taggart received his discharge in the bankrutcy roceedings.After the discharge, Emmert and Jehnke, reresented by attorney Stuart Brown, continued the state-court action. Taggart was largely absent from subsequent roceedings, although Berman renewed his motion to dismiss on Taggart’s behalf at the close of evidence. After a trial, the state court ruled in favor of Emmert and Jehnke and unwound the transfer of Taggart’s share of SPBC to Berman and exelled Taggart from the comany. The state court entered a judgment that allowed any arty to etition for attorneys’ fees, which led to yet more comlicated litigation in state and federal courts.Brown, the attorney for Emmert and Jehnke, filed a etition for attorneys’ fees in state court on behalf of SPBC, Emmert, and Jehnke, against both Berman and Taggart, but limiting fees against Taggart to those incurred after the date of Taggart’s bankrutcy discharge. The etition notified the court of Taggart’s bankrutcy discharge but argued he could still be liable for attorneys’ fees on the theory that Taggart had “returned to the fray.”While the attorneys’ fee etition was ending in state court, Taggart sought to reoen his bankrutcy roceeding in bankrutcy court. Once reoened, Taggart asked the court to hold Brown, Jehnke, Emmert, and SPBC (collectively the “Creditors”) in contemt for violating the bankrutcy discharge by seeking an award of attorneys’ fees against him in the state court action.The state court ruled that Taggart had “returned to the fray” as a matter of law, so he could be held liable for attorneys’ fees incurred after his bankrutcy. Taggart timely aealed the state-court determination.Subsequently, the bankrutcy court denied Taggart’s motion for contemt, agreeing with the state court that Taggart had “returned to the fray.” On aeal, the district court reversed, finding that Taggart’s actions did not constitute a “return to the fray” and thus the discharge injunction barred the claim against him for attorneys’ fees. The district court remanded for a determination whether the Creditors had “knowingly violated the discharge injunction in seeking attorneys’ fees.” On remand, the bankrutcy court found they had knowingly violated the discharge injunction and thus held them in contemt. On aeal, the Bankrutcy Aellate Panel (“BAP”) reversed the bankrutcy court’s finding of contemt, finding they had a good faith belief that the discharge injunction did not aly to their attorneys’ fee claim.Back in state court, the state aellate court found that Taggart’s actions did not constitute a “return to the fray” and thus reversed the state trial court as to its ruling on attorneys’ fees. As a result, the federal district court and the state aellate court both agreed that the Creditors could not ursue attorneys’ fees against Taggart, and the BAP’s ruling freed them from being held in contemt for knowingly violating the discharge injunction.The Ninth Circuit affirmed the BAP’s oinion, holding that the Creditors did not knowingly violate the discharge injunction and thus could not be held in contemt because they had a subjective good-faith belief that the discharge injunction did not aly to their state-court claim for attorneys’ fees."
"On November 19, 2015, a jury found defendant Maurice Lamont Davis guilty on six counts, including the illegal use or carrying of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence (a “Hobbs Act robbery”) and the illegal use or carrying of a firearm to aid and abet consiracy to commit a crime of violence. Also on November 19, 2015, a jury found defendant Andre Levon Glover guilty on seven counts, including the two counts described above.On aeal, the US Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an oinion on January 31, 2017, denying both defendants’ challenges and affirming the district court’s judgment below. The defendants etitioned the US Sureme Court for certiorari, and following the Court’s decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201715-1498""""emSessions v. Dimayaem, 584 U.S. __ (2018)a, the Court remanded their case back to the Fifth Circuit for further consideration in light of that decision. After requesting sulemental briefing from the arties on the effect of emDimayaem, the Fifth Circuit affirmed in art and vacated in art.18 U.S.C. § 924(c) contains both an “elements clause” and a “residual clause.” The elements clause defines an offense as a crime of violence if it “has as an element the use, attemted use, or threatened use of hysical force against the erson or roerty of another,” and the residual clause defines an offense as a crime of violence if it, “by its nature, involves a substantial risk that hysical force against the erson or roerty of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.” In emDimayaem, the Court addressed (and invalidated) a residual clause identical to the residual clause in § 924(c) but did not address the elements clause. Thus, the Fifth Circuit held the residual clause in 924(c) unconstitutionally vague under emDimayaem but did not invalidate the elements clause in that section. As a result of this holding, the Fifth Circuit affirmed its rior judgment as to the Hobbs Act robbery count but vacated as to the aiding and abetting consiracy count, because the former relies on the elements clause while the latter relies on the residual clause."
"The US Deartment of Defense awarded etitioner The Parsons Cororation a $60 million contract to erform munitions cleanu in Iraq. One comonent of the contract was that Parsons must rovide adequate security to its emloyees who would be erforming the cleanu. After seeking bids for a subcontract, a Parsons committee awarded it to ArmorGrou. Although etitioner Cochise Consultancy had submitted a bid, it did not win the subcontract. However, an Army Cors of Engineers contracting officer, Wayne Shaw, whom Cochise had allegedly bribed undertook elaborate efforts—including forgery, decetion, and threats—to induce Parsons to award the subcontract to Cochise rather than to ArmorGrou. One emloyee in articular refused to award the subcontract to Cochise, believing that the award was made in violation of government regulations. That emloyee was relaced, and his relacement allowed the award of the subcontract to Cochise to move forward.From February to Setember 2006, Cochise rovided security services under the subcontract. Each month, the US government aid Cochise at least $1 million more than it would have aid ArmorGrou had ArmorGrou been awarded the subcontract, lus other exenses related to Cochise not being adequately equied to erform the services required. In 2006, Shaw, who had orchestrated the fraudulent award of the subcontract to Cochise, rotated out of Iraq, and Parsons immediately reoened the subcontract for bidding and awarded it to ArmorGrou.Several years later, in 2010, FBI agents interviewed Parsons emloyee Billy Joe Hunt about his role in a searate kickback scheme, and during that interview Hunt informed the agents about the contractors’ fraudulent scheme involving the subcontract for security services. Hunt was charged with federal crimes related to the kickback scheme and served ten months in federal rison.After he was released, in 2013, Hunt filed a emqui tamem action under seal alleging that Parsons and Cochise had violated the False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–33, by submitting to the United States false or fraudulent claims for ayment. The United States declined to intervene in the action, and Hunt’s comlaint was unsealed. The contractors moved to dismiss, arguing that Hunt’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations in 31 U.S.C. § 3731(b)(1), which requires a civil action alleging an FCA violation to be brought within the later of (1) “6 years after the date on which the violation … is committed” or (2) “3 years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the United States charged with resonsibility to act in the circumstances….” The district court granted the contractors’ motion to dismiss, finding that under either rovision, Hunt’s claim would be time-barred. Reviewing the district court’s dismissal emde novoem, the US Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed and remanded. The Eleventh Circuit held that when Hunt (the relator) learned of the fraud is immaterial for statute of limitation uroses, and thus the eriod began to run when government officials learned of the facts giving rise to the claim."
"Jamar Quarles was charged with being a felon in ossession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C § 922(g).

Finding the felon-in-ossession conviction to be a third offense under the ACCA, the court sentenced Quarles to 204 months in rison. In light of the US Sureme Court’s decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201413-7120""""emJohnson v.

The district court found that Michigan’s crime of third-degree home invasion constituted a “violent felony” under the ACCA and resentenced Quarles to 204 months’ incarceration.Under federal law, a generic burglary is “an unlawful or unrivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.” Michigan law defines the crime of third-degree home invasion as breaking and entering a dwelling with intent to commit a misdemeanor in the dwelling, entering the dwelling without ermission with intent to commit a misdemeanor in the dwelling, or breaking and entering a dwelling and while entering or resent in the dwelling, committing a misdemeanor. This third otion of intent is the subject of the resent disute. Both the district court and the Sixth Circuit found unersuasive Quarles’s argument that the Michigan crime lacks the intent-uon-entry element that is required under generic burglary. Under binding Sixth Circuit recedent, generic burglary does not require intent at entry, so the Michigan crime of third-degree home invasion is not broader than the crime of generic burglary."
"Hamid Mohamed Ahmed Ali Rehaif was resent in the United States on an F-1 nonimmigrant student visa to study at Florida Institute of Technology. He was academically dismissed in December 2014, and his immigration status was terminated in February 2015. Rather than dearting the country, Rehaif remained, and in December 2015 went to a shooting range, urchased a box of ammunition, and rented a firearm for an hour. Six days later, an emloyee at the hotel where Rehaif was staying reorted to the olice that Rehaif had been acting strangely. Following u on the ti, an FBI agent soke with Rehaif, who admitted firing firearms at the shooting range and knowing that his student visa was out of status because he was no longer a student. Rehaif consented to a search of his hotel room, where agents found the remainder of the ammunition he urchased.A federal grand jury charged Rehaif with two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(5)(A), which rohibits a erson who “is illegally or unlawfully in the United States” from ossessing “any firearm or ammunition.” The enalty for violating that statute, described in 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2), is a fine, imrisonment for u to 10 years, or both.At trial, the government requested a jury instruction that “[t]he United States is not required to rove that the defendant knew that he was illegally or unlawfully in the United States.” Rehaif objected to this instruction, arguing that the government had to rove both that he had knowingly ossessed a firearm and that he had known that he was illegally or unlawfully in the United States when he ossessed the firearm.” The government also requested the instruction that “[t]he alien’s status becomes unlawful uon the date of the status violation”; Rehaif requested instead the instruction that “[a] erson admitted to the United States on a student visa does not become unlawfully resent until an Immigration Officer or an Immigration judge determines that [he] ha[s] violated [his] student status.” The district court instructed the jury as requested by the government and overruled Rehaif’s objection. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the convictions, citing binding circuit recedent holding that the government does not need to rove that the defendant knew of his rohibited status, as well as recedents from other circuits and lack of action by Congress to alter the law (suggesting the common judicial construction of the law was what Congress intended)."
"Resondent Brian Newton worked for Parker Drilling Management Services on a drilling latform fixed on the outer Continental Shelf, off the coast of Santa Barbara, California. His shifts lasted fourteen days, and he regularly worked twelve hours er day. He alleges that he usually took fifteen to thirty minutes during his shifts to eat without clocking out and that Parker did not rovide 30-minute meal eriods for each five hours worked, as required under California law. After Parker terminated him, Newton sued in state court for wage and hour violations under California law. Parker removed the case to federal court and filed a motion for judgment on the leadings. The district court granted the motion, finding that under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a comrehensive statutory scheme that leaves no room for state law to address wage and hour grievances arising on the Outer Continental Shelf. The district court recognized that the FLSA contains a clause that exressly allows for more rotective state wage and overtime laws but held nonetheless that California’s laws offered Newton no rotections.A anel of the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court’s dismissal on the leadings, finding that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act allows the laws of adjacent states to aly to drilling latforms as long as state law is “alicable” and “not inconsistent” with federal law. California’s wage and hour laws are not inconsistent with the FLSA, so the district court erred in dismissing the claims."
"In 1992, Joseh Lee Rice III established in New York an inter vivos trust with William B. Matteson as trustee and Rice’s descendants as the rimary beneficiaries (none of whom lived in North Carolina at the time of creation). In 2002, the original trust was divided into three searate trusts, one for each of Rice’s children. One of these trusts was the Kimberley Rice Kaestner 1992 Family Trust (“the Trust”), benefitting his daughter Kimberley Rice Kaestner, who, at the time of the division, was a resident and domiciliary of North Carolina.In 2005, Matteson resigned as trustee for the three trusts, and Rice aointed a successor trustee, who resided in Connecticut. From 2005 to 2008, the Trust aid state income taxes on income accumulated during those years, desite that no funds were distributed. In 2009, reresentatives of the Trust filed a claim for a refund of taxes aid to the North Carolina Deartment of Revenue, which the Deartment denied. The reresentatives brought suit in state court, asking the court to require the Deartment to refund all taxes aid and declare unconstitutional the state statute enabling the Deartment to collect taxes from the foreign trust. The judge granted the Deartment’s motion to dismiss the claim for injunctive relief but denied the motion as to the constitutional claims. Both arties then filed motions for summary judgment as to the constitutional claims. Finding the state statute unconstitutional as alied, the state court granted the Trust’s motion for summary judgment. The Deartment aealed.The The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires “minimum contacts” connecting a state and the roerty it seeks to tax. The state aellate court found that the mere fact that a non-contingent beneficiary of the trust is domiciled in North Carolina, alone, where the trust location, its assets, and its trustee, are all outside the state, does not establish sufficient contacts with North Carolina to ermit taxing the trust in that state. The state sureme court affirmed."
"The Food Stam Act of 1964 started one of the largest and fastest-growing welfare rograms in the country. Formerly known as the Food Stam Program, the Sulemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) sent over $78 billion on over 46 million eole in fiscal year 2012, as comared to the $75 million sent during its first year. Resondent Argus Leader Media, who runs a newsaer in South Dakota, invoked the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to seek information from the US Deartment of Agriculture (USDA) on how much money individual retailers received from taxayers each year. The USDA refused to rovide the information, citing numerous exemtions to FOIA.Argus filed a lawsuit against the USDA in federal district court, which found that the USDA roerly withheld the information under FOIA Exemtion 3, which alies to information rohibited from disclosure by another federal law. On aeal, the Eighth Circuit reversed, finding that Exemtion 3 did not aly to the contested data, and remanded the case back to the district court. On remand, the issue before the court was whether Exemtion 4—which covers “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a erson and rivileged or confidential”—alied to the information sought.For the urose of alying Exemtion 4, the circuit courts have adoted a definition of “confidential” different from the term’s ordinary meaning. Courts have held the term to mean that Exemtion 4 alies only if disclosure is likely to cause substantial harm to the cometitive osition of the source of the information. There is a circuit slit as to what “substantial cometitive harm” means. The district court in this case adoted the definition from the DC Circuit, which has held that “cometitive harm may be established if there is evidence of ‘actual cometition and the likelihood of substantial cometitive injury.’”  Aling that definition to the facts at hand, the court found seculative the USDA’s claims of cometitive injury and entered judgment for Argus. The USDA decided not to aeal the judgment, so etitioner Food Marketing Institute (FMI) intervened and filed the aeal. On aeal, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court."
"During the 2009 Working Families Party rimary election in Troy, New York, several individuals forged signatures and rovided false information on absentee ballot alications in an attemt to affect the outcome of the rimary. The individuals submitted the forged alications to the commissioner of the Rensselaer County elections board, Edward G. McDonough. McDonough aroved the alications but later claimed that he did not know they had been forged.After the lot was uncovered, the state court aointed Youel Smith as a secial district attorney to lead the investigation and rosecution of those involved. McDonough claimed that Smith engaged in an elaborate scheme to frame McDonough for the crimes. According to McDonough, Smith knew that McDonough was innocent and fabricated evidence in the form of forged affidavits, false testimony, and faulty DNA methods. After the first trial ended in a mistrial, the second trial ended in McDonough’s acquittal on December 21, 2012.On December 18, 2015, McDonough filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claiming that Smith and the other defendants violated his due rocess rights by fabricating evidence and using it against him before a grand jury and in two trials. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, claiming, among other things, that McDonough’s claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations because the allegedly fabricated evidence had been disclosed to McDonough over three years before he filed his Section 1983 claim.The district court granted the motions to dismiss as to McDonough’s due rocess claims, citing the statute of limitations. The US Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, finding that the recedent in that circuit established that the statute of limitations begins to run on a fabrication of evidence claim when the laintiff has “reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his action.” The Second Circuit acknowledged that Third, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have held otherwise but exressly disagreed with those decisions."
"Lois Davis was an information technology (IT) suervisor for Fort Bend County, Texas. She filed a comlaint with the county human resources deartment alleging that the IT director had sexually harassed and assaulted her, and following an investigation by the county, the director resigned. Davis alleges that after the director’s resignation, her suervisor—who was a ersonal friend of the director—retaliated against her for making the comlaint.Davis filed a charge with the Texas Workforce Commission alleging sexual harassment and retaliation. While the charge was ending, Davis allegedly informed her suervisor of a secific Sunday she could not work due to a “revious religious commitment,” and the suervisor did not arove the absence. Davis attended the event and did not reort to work, and Fort Bend terminated her emloyment.Davis submitted to the Commission an “intake questionnaire” in which she wrote in the word “religion” next to a checklist labeled “Emloyment Harms or Actions” but did not amend her charge of discrimination or exlain the note. The Commission informed Davis that it had made a reliminary decision to dismiss her charge and issued a right-to-sue letter. Davis filed her lawsuit in federal district court alleging both retaliation and religious discrimination under Title VII. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the county on all claims.The Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court as to the retaliation claim but reversed and remanded as to her religious discrimination claim, finding genuine disutes of material fact that warranted a trial. On remand, Fort Bend argued for the first time that Davis had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies on the religious discrimination claim, as required by Title VII. The district court agreed, finding that administrative exhaustion is a jurisdictional rerequisite in Title VII cases. Because subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by failure to challenge it, the district court dismissed Davis’s religious discrimination claim with rejudice.Title VII requires laintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies by filing formal charges with the EEOC. There is no consensus within the Fifth Circuit whether this requirement is a jurisdictional requirement (which may be raised at any oint and cannot be waived) or merely a rerequisite to suit (and thus subject to waiver). Relying on the Sureme Court’s decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases200504-944""""emArbaugh v. Y &am; H Cor.em, 546 U.S. 500 (2006)a, in which the Court held that the Title VII’s statutory limitation of covered emloyers to those with 15 or more emloyees was not jurisdictional, the Fifth Circuit held that the administrative exhaustion requirement was also not jurisdictional. This holding is consistent with holdings in the First, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, Tenth, and DC Circuits, but inconsistent with holdings by the Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits."
"Petitioner PDR Network is a comany that “delivers health knowledge roducts and services” to healthcare roviders and is erhas most known for ublishing the emPhysicians’ Desk Referenceem, a oular reference book with information on various rescrition drugs. In December 2013, PDR Network sent by fax to Carlton &am; Harris, a chiroractic office in West Virginia, an advertisement for a free eBook version of the 2014 emPhysicians’ Desk Referenceem. The material advised that the reciient had received the offer “because you are a member of the PDR Network.”On behalf of itself and a class of similarly situated reciients of faxes from PDR Network, Carlton &am; Harris sued PDR Network in federal court under the Telehone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), as amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, which generally rohibits the use of a fax machine to send “unsolicited advertisement[s].” Under that statute, the reciient of an unsolicited fax advertisement can sue the sender for damages and recover actual monetary loss or $500 in statutory damages for each violation. If a court finds the sender “willfully or knowingly violated” the TCPA, the reciient is entitled to trile damages.As a reliminary matter, the court found that the Hobbs Act does not require the court to defer to the FCC’s interretation of an unambiguous term. Substituting its own definition of “unsolicited advertisement” for the FCC’s definition of the term, which was romulgated by rule in 2006 (“2006 FCC Rule”), the court found that PDR Network’s fax was not an unsolicited advertisement because it lacked a “commercial aim.” Moreover, the court found that even under the 2006 FCC Rule, the fax would not be an “unsolicited advertisement.” For this reason, the district court granted PDR Network’s motion to dismiss.Carlton &am; Harris aealed, and the US Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated the lower court’s decision, finding that the Hobbs Act disallows district courts from considering the validity of orders like the 2006 FCC Rule, and that the district court’s interretation of the rule is at odds with the lain meaning of its text."
"Resondent Christoher Batterton was a deckhand on a vessel owned and oerated by the the etitioner, Dutra Grou. While Batterton was working on the vessel, a hatch cover blew oen and crushed his hand. The hatch cover blew oen because the vessel lacked a articular exhaust mechanism, the lack of which made the vessel unseaworthy as a matter of law.The district court denied Dutra Grou’s motion to strike the claim for unitive damages, and the US Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. In emEvich v. Morrisem, 819 F.2d 256 (9th Cir. 1987), the Ninth Circuit held that “unitive damages are available under general maritime law for claims of unseaworthiness,” as distinguished from Jones Act claims, where unitive damages are unavailable. Dutra Grou argues that emEvichem is imlicitly overruled by the US Sureme Court’s decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases199089-1158""""emMiles v. Aex Marine Cor.em, 498 U.S. 19 (1990)a, which holds that loss of society damages are unavailable in a general maritime action for wrongful death and lost future earnings are unavailable in a general maritime survival action.The Ninth Circuit found unersuasive Dutra Grou’s argument, finding that the Court in emMilesem considered only damages for loss of society and of future earnings, not unitive damages. While emMilesem does limit recovery for “ecuniary loss,” unitive damages are not “ecuniary loss,” which means simly loss of money. Thus, emMilesem left undisturbed the Ninth Circuit’s oinion in emEvichem."
"In May 2013, Gerald P. Mitchell was arrested for oerating a vehicle while intoxicated. He became lethargic on the way to the olice station, so the arresting officers took him to a hosital instead. An officer read him a statutorily mandated form regarding the state imlied consent law, but Mitchell was too incaacitated to indicate his understanding or consent and then fell unconscious. Without a warrant, at the request of the olice, hosital workers drew Mitchell’s blood, which revealed his blood alcohol concentration to be .222.Mitchell was charged with oerating while intoxicated and with a rohibited alcohol concentration. He moved to suress the results of the blood test on the ground that his blood was taken without a warrant and in the absence of any excetions to the warrant requirement. The state argued that under the imlied-consent statute, olice did not need a warrant to draw his blood. Many states, including Wisconsin, have imlied consent laws, which rovide that by driving a vehicle, motorists consent to submit to chemical tests of breath, blood, or urine to determine alcohol or drug content. The trial court sided with the state and allowed the results of the blood test into evidence. Mitchell was convicted on both counts.Mitchell aealed his conviction, and the court of aeals certified the case to the Sureme Court of Wisconsin with resect to the issue “whether the warrantless blood draw of an unconscious motorist ursuant to Wisconsin’s imlied consent law...violates the Fourth Amendment.” The Sureme Court of Wisconsin acceted the certification and uheld the search 5–2, but without any majority for the rationale for uholding it."
"The State of New York law rohibits the ossession of firearms without a license. To obtain a handgun license, an individual must aly with a local licensing officer—which, in New York City, is the olice commissioner—and the alication rocess involves an investigation into the alicant’s mental health history, criminal history, and moral character. There are two rimary tyes of handgun licenses: “carry” licenses and “remises” licenses. This case involves the latter, which ermits the licensee to “have and ossess in his dwelling” a istol or revolver. The remises license is secific to a articular address, and the handguns ermitted by the license may not be removed from that address excet in limited circumstances rescribed by law. One such circumstance is to “transort hisher handgun(s) directly to and from an authorized small arms rangeshooting club, unloaded, and in a locked container, the ammunition to be carried searately.” All small arms rangesshooting clubs authorized under the rule are located in New York City.Three individuals with remises licenses sought to transort their handguns to shooting ranges and cometitions outside New York City—which is rohibited by the rule. One of the individuals sought to transort his handgun between the remises in New York City for which it was licensed and his second home in Hancock, New York—which the rule also rohibits. The three individuals and etitioner New York State Rifle &am; Pistol Association filed a lawsuit in federal district court, asking the court to declare the city’s restrictions unconstitutional and to enjoin the city from enforcing them.The district court found the rule “merely regulates rather than restricts the right to ossess a firearm in the home and is a minimal, or at most, modest burden on the right” and thus did not violate laintiffs’ Second Amendment rights. The district court also held that the rule did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause, the First Amendment right of exressive association, or the fundamental right to travel. Reviewing the district court’s decision de novo, the US Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"This civil action first arose in 2014, when 12 Virginia voters alleged racial gerrymandering in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That case ultimately went before the US Sureme Court, and in 2017, the Court held that a lower court had alied the wrong legal standard in evaluating the challengers’ claims of racial gerrymandering. The Court uheld one of the districts and remanded the case for the lower court to reconsider the districting in the remaining 11 districts.In June 2018, the lower court struck down the 11 districts as unconstitutional, finding that race was the main factor used to determine the boundaries for the districts. The court found that the legislature failed to rove that the districts as drawn, which attemted to ut the exact same ercentage of African American adults in each district, were necessary to comly with federal voting-rights laws.The Virginia House of Delegates aealed the district court’s decision to the Sureme Court, and the Court agreed to review the case, as well as the reliminary question whether the House of Delegates has judicial standing to aeal."
"A three-judge district court struck down North Carolina’s 2016 congressional ma, ruling that the laintiffs had standing to challenge the ma and that the ma was the roduct of artisan gerrymandering. The district court then enjoined the state from using the ma after November 2018. North Carolina Reublicans, led by Robert Rucho, head of the senate redistricting committee, aealed the decision to the Sureme Court."
"Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross issued a decision to reinstate a citizenshi question on the 2020 Census questionnaire. The decision was challenged in federal court by a coalition of states, cities, and counties, with the challengers alleging that the question could cause a significant undercount because some households with individuals who are unlawfully resent in the country would be deterred from resonding. The challengers claim the Secretary’s decision was arbitrary and caricious and that it violates various regulatory, statutory, and constitutional rovisions.As art of its challenge, the challengers sought—and the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, the venue for their action, authorized—deositions of high-ranking Executive Branch officials to determine Secretary Ross’s subjective motivations in making the decision at issue.On October 5, 2018, Justice Ginsburg denied the government’s revious stay alication without rejudice, “rovided that the Court of Aeals will afford sufficient time for either arty to seek relief in this Court before the deositions in question are taken.” The court of aeals denied mandamus relief to quash the deosition of Secretary Ross and the deosition of other high-ranking officials, so the government renewed its alication for a stay. The Court then blocked the deosition of Secretary Ross but allowed others to roceed.The government filed a etition for mandamus asking the Court to direct the trial court to exclude fact-finding beyond the official records, or, in the alternative, review the aellate court decision itself. Treating the etition for mandamus as a etition for certiorari, the Court granted the etition to review the decision of the court below.Before the Court could rule, however, the district court issued its decision enjoining the Secretary from reinstating the question at issue. That action rendered the original case moot but resented an additional question whether the district court roerly issued the injunction."
"The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) ermits for the discharge of ollutants to navigable waters from oint sources, which the CWA defines as “discernible, confined, and discrete conveyances.” In contrast, all other sources of ollution are characterized as nonoint sources and are controlled through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other non-CWA rograms. The CWA also distinguishes between groundwater and navigable waters, the latter being “waters of the United States” and exclusive of the former.Constructed with funding by the EPA in the 1970s, the County of Maui’s Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility treats wastewater generated by homes and business in the western art of Maui by injecting treated wastewater (called “effluent”) into underground injection control (UIC) wells—a common method used by municialities to disose of effluent. Before injection, effluent is treated to meet R-1 water standards, Hawaii’s highest standards for recycled water. Some of the treated effluent is used for resort and golf course irrigation. Uon injection, effluent immediately mixes with groundwater and diserses vertically and horizontally, eventually migrating to the ocean. Over 90% of the effluentgroundwater mixture enters the ocean through diffuse flow, with no identifiable entry oint. Reorts from 1973, 1991, and 1994 indicate that both the EPA and the Hawaii Deartment of Health (HDOH) understood that the wastewater entered the ocean, and neither agency suggested that this result required NPDES ermitting.The district court at summary judgment held that the County violated the CWA by discharging effluent through groundwater and into the ocean without the NPDES ermit required by the CWA, and that the County had fair notice of its violations. The court based its ruling on findings that the County “indirectly discharged[d] a ollutant into the ocean through a groundwater conduit,” (2) the groundwater is a “oint source” as defined by the CWA, and (3) the groundwater is a “navigable water” under the CWA. The County aealed, and a anel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court."
"The facts giving rise to this case are not immediately relevant to the issue on which the Court ruled. Aileen Rizo, an emloyee of the Fresno County Office of Education, filed a lawsuit against the suerintendent of schools, claiming, among other things, that the county was violating the Equal Pay Act of 1963. The district court denied the county's motion for summary judgment, and a anel of the Ninth Circuit vacated the lower court's decision on the basis of binding Ninth Circuit recedent interreting the statute. The Ninth Circuit granted a rehearing en banc and issued an oinion authored by Judge Stehen Reinhardt with a new, urortedly binding interretation of the statute.Judge Reinhardt died after he had finished writing the oinion but 11 days before it was officially filed. Without Judge Reinhardt, the oinion authored by him would have been aroved by only 5 of the 10 judges sitting en banc, and those judges concurred on the judgment but not the reasoning."
"Kevin Rotkiske accumulated credit card debt between 2003 and 2005, which his bank referred to Klemm &am; Associates for collection. Klemm filed a collections lawsuit against Rotkiske in March 2008 but was unable to locate him for service of rocess. Klemm refiled its suit in January 2009 and attemted to serve Rotkiske at the same address. Unbeknownst to Rotkiske, someone at that address acceted service on his behalf, and Klemm obtained a default judgment against him. Rotkiske only discovered the judgment when he alied for a mortgage in Setember 2014.Rotkiske filed the resent action against Klemm alleging that its actions violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Klemm moved to dismiss the claim as time-barred, and the district court granted the motion to dismiss. The FDCPA rovides that any action under the Act must be brought “within one year from the date on which the violation occurs.” Rotkiske argued that the statute incororates a “discovery rule,” which is recognized in both the Fourth and Ninth Circuits and which “delays the beginning of a limitations eriod until the laintiff knew or should have known of his injury.” The district court rejected this argument, finding that under a lain reading of the statute, the limitations eriod begins at the time of injury. Rotkiske aealed, but before the aellate anel issued its oinion and judgment, the Third Circuit ordered rehearing emen bancem. The Third Circuit, sitting emen bancem, affirmed the judgment of the district court."
"The controversy before the Court arises from three cases resenting the same issue.In emState v. Garciaem, Ramiro Garcia was stoed for seeding in Overland Park, Kansas. When asked why he was seeding, he told officers that he was on his way to work. A records check revealed that he was already the subject of an investigation, and olice contacted his emloyer to obtain emloyment documents. Among the documents was his federal Form I-9, which listed a social security number belonging to another erson. Further investigation revealed that Garcia had used the same number on other federal and state forms. On the basis of this information, Garcia was charged with identity theft under state law.In emState v. Moralesem, a secial agent with the Social Security Administration determined that Donaldo Morales was using a social security number issued to another erson. The agent reviewed Morales’s emloyment file, which included a federal Form I-9 as well as various federal and state tax forms. Morales was charged with identity theft and two other state-law offenses.In emState v. Ochoa-Laraem, federal and state officers determined that Guadalue Ochoa-Lara was using a social security number issued to another individual to lease an aartment. On further investigation, officers reviewed the Form W-4 that Ochoa-Lara had comleted for emloyment and found he was using the same social security number that belonged to another individual. On this basis, Ochoa-Lara was charged with two counts of identity theft under state law.All three defendants were convicted of at least one related charge, and all three aealed their convictions."
"Evangelisto Ramos was charged with second-degree murder and exercised his right to a jury trial. After deliberating, ten of the twelve jurors found that the rosecution had roven its case against Ramos beyond a reasonable doubt, while two jurors reached the oosite conclusion. Under Louisiana’s non-unanimous jury verdict law, agreement of only ten jurors is sufficient to enter a guilty verdict, so Ramos was sentenced to life in rison without the ossibility of arole.Ramos aealed his case, and the state aellate court affirmed the lower court. The Louisiana Sureme Court denied review."
"Kraig Kahler enjoyed a hay marriage and valued his family for many years. However, in 2008, his marriage began to falter, and his wife began an extramarital affair. By the next year, the formerly hay coule was heading toward divorce, and Kahler allegedly became abusive toward his wife and estranged from their children. Kahler increasingly suffered from deression and obsessive comulsive disorder, and though he saw several sychologists and sychiatrists who rescribed antideressants, anti-anxiety medications, and slee aids, he refused to take his medications as directed.In November 2009, Kahler went to his wife’s grandmother’s house, where his family was visiting, and shot and killed his wife, his two daughters, and the grandmother. Kahler was arrested, charged, and sentenced to death for the four killings. Exerts for the defense and the rosecution agreed that Kahler exhibited major deressive disorder, obsessive-comulsive, borderline, aranoid, and narcissistic ersonality tendencies. The defense exert testified that, in his oinion, due to Kahler’s mental illness, he did not make the rational choice to kill his family members and indeed had at the time of the shooting temorarily “comletely lost control.”Under Kansas law, a jury cannot consider mental disease or defect as a defense to a crime excet insofar as it shows “that the defendant lacked the mental state required as an element of the offense charged.” In effect, this law makes irrelevant “whether the defendant is unable to know the nature and quality of his actions or know the difference between right and wrong with resect to his actions.”The Kansas Sureme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence."

Lamoneem, 585 U.S. __ (2018)a, the Court heard the case and issued a er curiam (unsigned) oinion that did not resolve the substantive legal questions. Rather, in that oinion the Court emhasized that the case was in its early stages and that the Court was reviewing the district court’s decision under a lenient standard—abuse of discretion. Under that standard, the Court found that the district court’s ruling (denying the laintiffs’ motion for a reliminary injunction barring the state from enforcing the redistricting lan and requiring it to imlement a new ma for the 2018 midterm elections) was not unreasonable.After the Court decided a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201716-1161""""emGill v.

"While on atrol, a Kansas olice officer ran a registration check on a icku truck with a Kansas license late. Uon running the check, the officer learned that the truck was registered to Charles Glover, Jr., and that his license had been revoked. Acting on susicion that the owner was unlawfully oerating the vehicle (based on the assumtion that the registered owner of the truck was also the driver), the officer stoed the truck. The officer confirmed that Glover was the driver and issued him a citation for being a habitual violator of Kansas traffic laws.Glover moved to suress all evidence from the sto, arguing that the sto violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. According to Glover, the olice officer lacked reasonable susicion to ull him over. The state argued that a law enforcement officer may infer that the owner of a vehicle is the one driving the vehicle, absent information to the contrary, and the knowledge that the owner has a revoked license combined with that inference gives rise to reasonable susicion to conduct an investigative sto.The state trial court concluded that it is not reasonable for an officer to infer that the registered owner of a vehicle is also its driver and granted Glover’s motion to suress. The aellate court reversed, and the Kansas Sureme Court granted review. The sureme court reversed the lower court, holding that the inference imermissibly “stacked” assumtions and would relieve the state of its burden of showing reasonable susicion for a sto."
"Donald Zarda worked in 2010 as a sky-diving instructor at Altitude Exress. Part of his job was to articiate in tandem skydives with clients, in which he was necessarily straed in close roximity to the client. A gay man, Zarda sometimes told female clients about his sexual orientation to address any concern they might have about being straed to a man for a tandem skydive. On one occasion after Zarda informed a female client about his sexual orientation and erformed the tandem jum with her, the client alleged that Zarda had inaroriately touched her and disclosed his sexual orientation to excuse his behavior. In resonse to this comlaint, Zarda's boss fired him. Zarda denied touching the client inaroriately and claimed that he was fired solely because of his reference to his sexual orientation.Zarda filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) claiming that he was fired because of his sexual orientation and also because of he did not conform to male gender stereotyes. He brought a claim in federal court alleging, among other things, that Altitude Exress violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by terminating him because of his sexual orientation. The district court ruled for Altitude Exress, finding that Title VII does not rotect against discrimination based on sexual orientation. After the district court's ruling, the EEOC issued an oinion in a searate case (ersuasive but not binding on federal district courts) that Title VII's “on the basis of sex” language necessarily includes discrimination “on the basis of sexual orientation.” In light of this decision, Zarda moved for the district court to reinstate his Title VII claim, but the district court denied the motion, citing binding Second Circuit recedent, a href=""""htts:law.justia.comcasesfederalaellate-courtsF323233514971""""emSimonton v.

"Gerald Bostock, a gay man, began working for Clayton County, Georgia, as a child welfare services coordinator in 2003. During his ten-year career with Clayton County, Bostock received ositive erformance evaluations and numerous accolades. In 2013, Bostock began articiating in a gay recreational softball league. Shortly thereafter, Bostock received criticism for his articiation in the league and for his sexual orientation and identity generally. During a meeting in which Bostock’s suervisor was resent, at least one individual oenly made disaraging remarks about Bostock’s sexual orientation and his articiation in the gay softball league. Around the same time, Clayton County informed Bostock that it would be conducting an internal audit of the rogram funds he managed. Shortly afterwards, Clayton County terminated Bostock allegedly for “conduct unbecoming of its emloyees.”Within months of his termination, Bostock filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC). Three years later, in 2016, he filed a ro se lawsuit against the county alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district court dismissed his lawsuit for failure to state a claim, finding that Bostock’s claim relied on an interretation of Title VII as rohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, contrary to a 1979 decision holding otherwise, the continued which was recently affirmed in a href=""""htts:law.justia.comcasesfederalaellate-courtsca1115-1523415-15234-2017-03-10.html""""emEvans v.

"A native and citizen of Jamaica, Andre Barton was admitted to the United States in 1989 under a B-2 visitor visa. Three years later, in 1992, he became a lawful ermanent resident. In 1996, a few months before he had been in the country for seven years, Barton was charged with and convicted of three felonies: aggravated assault, first-degree criminal damage to roerty, and ossession of a firearm during the ossession of a felony. In 2007 and 2008, he was charged with and convicted of violating the Georgia Controlled Substances Act. After these offenses, the Deartment of Homeland Security served Barton with a notice to aear, charging him as removable (deortable) on several grounds. Barton conceded removability as to two of the charges but denied two of them. He also gave notice of his intent to seek cancellation of removal as a lawful ermanent resident. The immigration judge sustained the two conceded charges, and the government withdrew the other two charges.Barton then filed an alication for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), which allows the attorney general to cancel the removal of an otherwise removable lawful ermanent resident if, among other things, the individual “has resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status.” This residency requirement is subject to a “sto-time rule” which terminates the accrual of continuous residency when the individual commits a statutorily described crime that renders the individual “inadmissible” or “removable.” The government argued that Barton had not accrued the seven years of continuous residence since his admission to the United States in 1989 because his 1996 crimes triggered the time-sto rule. In resonse, Barton argued that his 1996 crimes did not trigger the sto-time rule because as an already-admitted lawful ermanent resident who was not seeking admission or readmission to the United States, he could not as a matter of law be “rendered inadmissible” within the meaning of § 1229b(a).The immigration judge ruled in the government’s favor, and in a non-recedential single-member decision, the Board of Immigration Aeals affirmed the immigration judge’s decision. On aeal the US Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, finding that a erson need not seek admission (or readmission) to be “rendered inadmissible.”"
"In 2004, CITGO Ashalt Refining Co. and related comanies contracted with Frescati Shiing Co. and others for a shiment of crude oil from Venezuela to Paulsboro, New Jersey. Frescati owned and oerated the oil tanker, which had nearly comleted its 1,900-mile journey to its destination berth on the Delaware River. To reach its intended berth, the tanker needed to ass through Federal Anchorage Number 9, a federally designated section of the river in which shis may anchor. That area is eriodically surveyed for deth and dredged by the Army Cors of Engineers, but no government agency is resonsible for reemtively searching for obstructions. Anyone who wishes to search for obstructions in that area may do so, but dredging requires a ermit from the Cors of Engineers.As it assed through this section of the river, the tanker hit an abandoned anchor, causing aroximately 264,000 gallons of crude oil to sill into the river. The cleanu cost was $143 million.Frescati originally aid for the cleanu and was then reimbursed $88 million by the federal government, under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Frescati and the United States filed a lawsuit seeking a ortion of costs from CITGO, the intended reciient of the oil.At the beginning of what turned out to be extensive litigation, the district court initially found that CITGO was not liable under contract or tort law. The US Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit vacated the decision in art after determining that Frescati was a third-arty beneficiary of CITGO’s safe berth warranty and that CITGO had a duty of care to Frescati (thus imlicating liability under both contract and tort theories). On remand, the district court found CITGO liable under both contract and tort. However, the court also found that the Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and Atmosheric Administration (NOAA), and the Army Cors of Engineers misled CITGO into believing the anchorage was free of obstructions and reduced CITGO’s liability by 50%. The government, CITGO, and Frescati all aealed, and the Third Circuit affirmed the contract claim, vacated the negligence claim, and affirmed in art other claims."
"Aimee Stehens worked as a funeral director at R.G. &am; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc., which is a closely held for-rofit cororation that oerates several funeral homes in Michigan. For most of her emloyment at the Funeral Home, Stehens lived and resented as a man. Shortly after she informed the Funeral Home’s owner and oerator that she intended to transition from male to female, she was terminated.Stehens filed a comlaint with the Equal Emloyment Oortunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that she had been terminated based on unlawful sex discrimination. After conducting an investigation, the EEOC brought a lawsuit against the Funeral Home charging that it had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by terminating Stehen’s emloyment on the basis of her transgender or transitioning status and her refusal to conform to sex-based stereotyes.The district court granted summary judgment to the Funeral Home, and a anel of the US Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the Funeral Home’s termination of Stehens based on her transgender status constituted sex discrimination in violation of Title VII."
"The Indiana legislature assed two laws at issue in this case.The first related to the disosition of fetal remains by abortion roviders. This law changed the definition of infectious and athological waste, thereby reventing abortion roviders from incinerating fetal remains with surgical byroducts. The law also authorized simultaneous cremation of fetal remains, which Indiana law does not allow for human remains.The second rovision of Indiana law barred the knowing rovision of sex-, race-, or disability-selective abortions by abortion roviders.Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky challenged the laws on constitutional grounds but notably did not make the argument that either law burdened a fundamental right."
"In 1996, a rivate researcher hired etitioner Frederick Allen and his comany, Nautilus Productions, LLC, to document the recently discovered shiwreck of Blackbeard’s Queen Anne’s Revenge, which ran aground at Beaufort, North Carolina, in 1718. Allen documented the shiwreck for nearly twenty years in hotograhs and videos and registered his works with the U.S. Coyright Office.At some oint before October 2013, the state of North Carolina osted various of the coyrighted works of Allen online without his ermission. In October 2013, the state and other involved arties entered into a settlement agreement with Allen and his comany, aying him for the infringement of his works and agreeing not to infringe the works going forward. At the time, the state removed its infringing works, but shortly afterward, it again osted and ublished Allen’s works. The state then assed “Blackbeard’s Law,” which urortedly converted Allen’s works into “ublic record” materials that the state could use freely.Allen sued the state for coyright infringement, and the state moved to dismiss on the grounds of sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Allen argued that the Coyright Remedy Clarification Act (CRCA)—which defines otential infringers of coyright to include “any State, any instrumentality of a State, and any officer of a State or instrumentality of a State acting in his or her official caacity”—abrogates state sovereign immunity for coyright infringement claims.The district court denied the motion to dismiss, finding ersuasive Allen’s arguments regarding the CRCA’s abrogation of sovereign immunity. The Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that Congress lacked authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity via the CRCA."
"Gonzalo Holguin was convicted for ossession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of federal law, and sentenced to 24 months in rison, followed by two years of suervised release. Holguin was again arrested for ossession and intent to distribute, and after that arrest the government filed a etition to revoke the suervised release term. Before the revocation hearing occurred, Holguin leaded guilty to the second set of charges.At the revocation hearing, the district court exlained the allegations of the revocation etition to Holguin and asked how he leaded. Holguin answered “True.” Holguin’s attorney argued for a concurrent sentence on the revocation, but the court issued a 12-month consecutive sentence instead. Holguin aealed the reasonableness of his sentence, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, finding Holguin had failed to make a formal objection after the announcement of his sentence."
"In a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201312-751""""emFifth Third Bancor v. Dudenhoefferem, 573 U.S. __ (2014)a, the Sureme Court unanimously held that under the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), fiduciaries to an emloyee stock ownershi lan (ESOP) are not entitled to a resumtion of rudence regarding their decisions to buy or hold emloyer stock. Rather, for a laintiff to state a claim for breach of the fiduciary duty of rudence based on inside information, the laintiff need only “lausibly allege that a rudent fiduciary in the defendant’s osition could not have concluded that [an alternative action] would do more harm than good to the fund.” Thus the Court established a “context-secific” leading standard rather than a generalized resumtion standard.IBM offers as a benefit to its emloyees an ERISA-qualified ESOP, invested redominantly in IBM common stock, with Retirement Plans Committee of IBM as the fiduciary. In 2015, two substantially similar lawsuits were filed against IBM and its officers, one under securities laws and the other under ERISA. Both lawsuits alleged that IBM fraudulently concealed roblems with the comany’s microelectronics unit, thereby artificially inflating IBM’s reorted value. By continuing to invest in IBM stock desite allegedly knowing that the market rice was artificially inflated due to the fraudulent scheme, the laintiffs in the ERISA lawsuit argued that the ESOP’s fiduciaries breached their duty of rudence under Section 404 of ERISA.The district court dismissed the ERISA lawsuit for failure to state a claim, finding that the laintiffs failed to meet the leading standard established in emFifth Thirdem, as they had not alleged facts showing that the fiduciaries “could not have concluded” that ublicly disclosing the alleged “fraud” or halting further investments in IBM stock would be more likely to harm the fund than to hel it.The laintiffs amended their comlaint to add generic allegations that disclosure of the alleged fraud was “inevitable” and that the magnitude of the stock rice correction resulting from a delayed disclosure would increase over time. The laintiffs also added a claim that the fiduciaries could have avoided doing more harm than good by instead urchasing a “low-cost” hedging roduct.The district court again dismissed the lawsuit for failing to meet the emFifth Thirdem leading standard and because a rudent fiduciary could reasonably find their roosed alternative likely to cause more harm than good. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit reversed, finding that “when a ‘dro in the value of the stock already held by the fund’ is inevitable, it is far more lausible that a rudent fiduciary would refer to limit the effects of the stock’s artificial inflation on the ESOP’s beneficiaries through romt disclosure.”"
"This case arises from Montana’s Anaconda Smelter site—the location of a large coer concentrating and smelting oeration that started in 1884 and exanded to other nearby areas in 1902. In 1977, Atlantic Richfield urchased Anaconda Smelter, and it shut down smelter activities in 1980. The smelter oerations over the almost-century of oerations caused high concentrations of arsenic, lead, coer, cadmium, and zinc to contaminate soil, groundwater, and surface water. In 1983, the EPA rioritized the Anaconda Smelter site as a Suerfund site, working with Atlantic Richfield to address the contamination. Since then, Atlantic Richfield has worked with the EPA for 35 years to remediate the site, at a cost of aroximately $470 million.In 2008, landowners within the Anaconda Suerfund site sued Atlantic Richfield in Montana state court, alleging that the smelter oerations between 1884 and 1980 had caused damage to their roerties. Atlantic Richfield raised no objections to the laintiffs’ claims of loss of use and enjoyment of roerty, diminution of value, incidental and consequential damages, and annoyance and discomfort. However, it did object to the common-law claim for “restoration” damages.To establish a claim for restoration damages in Montana, laintiffs must rove that they will actually use the award to clean u the site. The laintiffs in this case alleged that restoration of their roerty requires “work in excess of what the EPA required of Atlantic Richfield in its selected remedy.” Atlantic Richfield moved for summary judgment, arguing that the restoration claim constituted a “challenge” to the EPA’s remedy and thus was jurisdictionally barred by CERCLA § 113, which derives courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges to EPA-selected remedies. Atlantic Richfield also argued that the landowners are “otentially resonsible arties” and thus must seek EPA aroval under 42 U.S.C. § 9622(e)(6) of CERCLA before engaging in remedial action. Finally, Atlantic Richfield argued that CERCLA reemted state common-law claims for restoration.The trial court held that CERCLA ermitted laintiffs’ claim for restoration damages, and Atlantic Richfield sought a writ of suervisory control from the Montana Sureme Court, which the court granted. Over a dissent, the Sureme Court of Montana rejected all three of Atlantic Richfield’s arguments, affirming the trial court’s decision ermitting the laintiffs to roceed to a jury trial on their restoration claim."
"By way of relevant background, James McKinney’s childhood was “horrific” due to overty, hysical and emotional abuse—all detailed in the court filings. Around age 11, he began drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, and he droed out of school in the seventh grade. He reeatedly tried to run away from home and was laced in juvenile detention.In 1991, when McKinney was 23, he and his half-brother Michael Hedlund committed two burglaries that resulted in two deaths. The state of Arizona tried McKinney and Hedlund before dual juries. McKinney’s jury found him guilty of two counts of first-degree murder (without secifying whether it reached that verdict by finding remeditation or by finding felony murder), and Hedlund’s jury found him guilty of one count of first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder.At McKinney’s caital sentencing hearing (before a judge), a sychologist testified that he had diagnosed McKinney with PTSD “resulting from the horrific childhood McKinney had suffered.” The sychologist further testified that witnessing violence could trigger McKinney’s childhood trauma and roduce “diminished caacity.” The trial judge credited the sychologist’s testimony, but under Arizona law at the time, the judge was rohibited from considering non-statutory mitigating evidence that the judge found to be unconnected to the crime. Because McKinney’s PTSD was not connected to the burglaries, the judge could not consider it mitigating evidence and thus sentenced him to death.The Arizona Sureme Court affirmed McKinney’s death sentence on aeal. In 2003, McKinney filed a habeas etition in federal court. The district court denied relief, and a anel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Ninth Circuit granted rehearing en banc and held that the Arizona courts had violated the U.S. Sureme Court’s decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases198180-5727""""emEddings v. Oklahomaem, 455 U.S. 104 (1982)a, by refusing to consider McKinney’s PTSD. In Eddings, the Court held that a sentencer in a death enalty case may not refuse consider any relevant mitigating evidence. A violation of emEddingsem, the Ninth Circuit held, required resentencing. Thus, the Ninth Circuit remanded to the federal district court to either correct the constitutional error or vacate the sentence and imose a lesser sentence. Arizona moved for indeendent review of McKinney’s sentence by the Arizona Sureme Court; McKinney oosed the motion on the ground that he was entitled to resentencing by a jury under the U.S. Sureme Court’s decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases200101-488""""emRing v. Arizonaem, 536 U.S. 584 (2002)a, which held that juries, rather than judges, must make the findings necessary to imose the death enalty.

"In 2015, Christoher Sulyma, a former Intel emloyee and articiant in the comany’s retirement lans filed a lawsuit against the comany for allegedly investing retirement funds in violation of Section 1104 of the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which sets forth the standard of care of fiduciaries. Sulyma alleged that the funds were not roerly diversified and that as a result, they did not erform well during his emloyment (and thus investment) eriod of 2010 to 2012.Intel moved to dismiss the comlaint as time-barred under 29 U.S.C. § 1113(2), which rovides that an action under Section 1104 may not be commenced more than “three years after the earliest date on which the laintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation.” The district court converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and ordered discovery for the question of the statute of limitations. After discovery, the district court found no genuine disute as to any material fact that Sulyma had actual knowledge of the investments more than three years before filing the action, and it granted summary judgment for Intel. Sulyma aealed.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit held that “actual knowledge” does not mean that the laintiff knew that the underlying action violated ERISA or that the underlying action even occurred, only that the laintiff was actually aware of the nature of the alleged breach. For a Section 1104 action, this means the laintiff must have known that the defendant had acted and that those acts were imrudent. The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment and remanded for further roceedings."
"Michelle Monasky, a U.S. citizen married to Domenico Taglieri, an Italian citizen, claimed that Taglieri had reeatedly assaulted her before and during her regnancy. Monasky returned to the United States with their two-month-old daughter, and Taglieri asked an Italian court to terminate Monasky’s arental rights.The Italian court ruled in Taglieri’s favor ex arte (without an aearance by Monasky). Taglieri then asked a federal court to require that Monasky return the baby to Italy. The court granted Taglieri’s etition, finding that Italy was the baby’s habitual residence. Both the Sixth Circuit and the U.S. Sureme Court denied Monasky’s motion for a stay ending aeal, so Monasky returned their daughter to Italy. A anel of the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision, and then the Sixth Circuit agreed to a rehearing en banc.The International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 22 U.S.C. § 9001 et seq. imlements the Hague Convention in the United States, and the law defines wrongful removal as taking a child in violation of custodial rights “under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal.” To determine the child’s habitual residence, a court must look “to the lace in which the child has become ‘acclimatized,’ or as a back-u inquiry, “shared arental intent.” Because the child, at two months of age, was too young to acclimate to a country, the relevant inquiry is the arents’ shared intent. The district court is in the best osition to make such an inquiry, and, finding no clear error in the district court’s finding as to habitual residence, the Sixth Circuit (en banc) affirmed."

ESN alleged that Comcast’s decision not to carry ESN’s networks was based, at least in art, on racial animus against ESN, which is the only 100% African American-owned multi-channel media comany in the United States. At the time of Comcast’s decision, several other large distributors— including Charter Communications, Time Warner Cable, DirecTV, and AT&am;T—had also declined to enter into carriage agreements with ESN.The district court dismissed ESN’s original comlaint and several subsequent amended comlaints against Comcast and other defendants for failure to lead facts that state a lausible claim for relief. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeal for the Ninth Circuit held in a related case involving Charter Communications that “mixed-motive claims are cognizable under § 1981,” meaning that “even if racial animus was not the but-for cause of a defendant’s refusal to contract, a laintiff can still revail if she demonstrates that discriminatory intent was a factor in that decision.” Alying this standard, the Ninth Circuit concluded that ESN had stated a valid Section 1981 claim based on its assertions that the carriers had entered into contracts with “white-owned, lesser-known networks during the same eriod.”The Ninth Circuit declined etitions for rehearing en banc."
"Ritzen Grou contracted to buy a iece of roerty from Jackson Masonry, but the sale was never comleted. Ritzen claims that Jackson breached the contract by roviding erroneous documentation about the roerty just before the deadline, while Jackson claims Ritzen breached by failing to secure funding to urchase the roerty by the deadline.Ritzen sued Jackson for breach of contract in Tennessee state court, and just before trial, Jackson filed for bankrutcy, triggering an automatic stay of the litigation under 11 U.S.C. § 362. Ritzen filed a motion to lift the stay, which the bankrutcy court denied, and Ritzen did not aeal the denial. Instead, Ritzen brought a claim against the bankrutcy estate. The bankrutcy court ruled for Jackson, finding that Ritzen, not Jackson, breached the contract.After this adverse ruling, Ritzen filed two aeals in the district court. The first aeal arose from the bankrutcy court’s order denying relief from the automatic stay (which Ritzen did not aeal at the time). The second aeal arose from the bankrutcy court’s determination that Ritzen, not Jackson, breached the contract. The district court ruled against Ritzen on both aeals; the first aeal was untimely filed, and the second one failed on the merits.Ritzen aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit, which reviewed the bankrutcy court’s findings of fact under the abuse of discretion standard and its legal conclusions de novo. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, finding that Ritzen had missed two deadlines: the contract deadline, leading to its breach, and the aeal deadline, leading to its waiver of aeal."
"Pedro Pablo Guerrero-Lasrilla, a native and citizen of Colombia, entered the United States in 1986 as a legal immigrant but was removed in 1998 due to felony drug convictions. In Setember 2016, Guerrero filed a motion to reoen, claiming that the 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) in emMatter of Abdelghanyem rendered him eligible to seek relief under former Immigration and Nationality Act § 212(c). The immigration judge denied Guerrero’s motion to reoen, finding it not timely filed. Given that emAbdelghanyem was decided in 2014, the immigration judge found the two-year delay in filing the motion to reoen indicated Guerrero had not diligently ursued his rights as required for equitable tolling.On aeal, the BIA affirmed the immigration judge’s denial of the motion to reoen, finding that the motion was untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision. And the BIA agreed with the immigration judge that equitable tolling did not aly to extend the 90-day deadline.

"This case arises out of a comlex rocedural history involving a atent disute between several arties and concerns not the merits of the roceedings but a rocedural asect of it.The America Invents Act created “inter artes review” as a way of challenging a atent before the Patent Trial and Aeal Board. One rovision, 35 U.S.C. § 315(b), recludes the institution of inter artes review more than one year after the etitioner “is served with a comlaint” alleging infringement of the atent. The arties disagree over whether this one-year time bar alies when the underlying atent infringement suit has been voluntarily dismissed without rejudice.The Federal Circuit, sitting en banc, held that it does aly. The court rejected the argument that a voluntary dismissal without rejudice restores the arties to their ositions as though no legal roceedings had ever begun, concluding instead that a defendant served with a comlaint remains “served” even if the civil action is voluntarily dismissed without rejudice and thus does such a dismissal does not toll the statute of limitations.Further, 35 U.S.C. § 315(d) rovides that “the determination by the Director whether to institute an inter artes review under this section shall be final and nonaealable.” Notwithstanding this rovision, the en banc Federal Circuit held that a decision to institute an inter artes review after finding that the § 315(b) time bar did not aly was aealable."
"Congress, in order to ersuade the nation’s health insurance industry to rovide insurance to reviously uninsured or uninsurable ersons, the legislation creating the Affordable Care Act rovided that insurance losses over a designated ercentage would be reimbursed, and comarable rofits would be turned over to the government.In reliance on the government’s commitment to reimburse them, the nation’s insurance industry rovided the designated health insurance. However, when some carriers exerienced significant losses, the government refused to aroriate the funds to ay the statutory shortfall and rohibited existing funds from being used for this urose. As a result, the insurers did not receive reimbursement.Several of these insurance carriers filed suit against the government seeking reimbursement. The courts denied them the relief they sought, in art relying on the “cardinal rule” disfavoring imlied reeals, which alies with “esecial force” to aroriations acts and requires that reeal not to be found unless the later enactment is “irreconcilable” with the former."
"The Official Code of Georgia Annotated is a comilation of Georgia statutes accomanied by various annotations, “consisting of history lines, reeal lines, cross references, commentaries, case notations, editor’s notes, excerts from law review articles, summaries of oinions of the Attorney General of Georgia, summaries of advisory oinions of the State Bar, and other research references.” Although the Code itself states that the annotations are art of the official code and that the statutory ortions “shall be merged with annotations,” Georgia law says that the annotations themselves do not have the force of law. The annotations are reared ursuant to an agreement between Mathew Bender &am; Co., an oerating division of the LexisNexis Grou, and the State of Georgia, under which the state exercises ervasive suervisory control by way of its Code Revision Commission, a body established by the Georgia General Assembly. The Commission is comrised of the Lieutenant Governor, four members of the Georgia Senate, the Seaker of the Georgia House of Reresentatives, four additional members of the Georgia House of Reresentatives, and five members aointed by the resident of the State Bar of Georgia.Public.Resource.Org (PRO) is a non-rofit organization with a mission of imroving ublic access to government records and rimary legal materials. In 2013, PRO urchased all 186 volumes of the rint version of the OCGA and its sulements, scanned them, and uloaded them to its website to be freely accessible to the ublic. It also distributed digital coies to Georgia legislators and other organizations and websites.The Commission sent PRO several cease-and-desist letters on the grounds that ublication infringes on the State of Georgia’s coyright in their work, but PRO ersisted. The Commission sued PRO in 2015 in federal district court, seeking injunctive relief. PRO acknowledged its ublication and dissemination of the OCGA but denied that the State of Georgia holds an enforceable coyright in the Code. The district court ruled for the Commission, finding that because the annotations of the OCGA lack the force of law, they are not ublic domain material. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, finding that because of the way they are written and integrated into the “official” code, the annotations in the OCGA are attributable to the constructive authorshi of the Peole and are thus intrinsically ublic domain material. To reach this conclusion, the Eleventh Circuit examined the identity of the ublic officials who created the work, the authoritativeness of the work, and the rocess by which the work was created—finding that each of these markers suorted the conclusion that the Peole were constructively the authors of the annotations."
"Gregory Dean Banister was convicted by a jury of aggravated assault with a deadly weaon and sentenced to thirty years’ imrisonment. He filed a habeas etition asserting numerous constitutional violations, which the district court denied on the merits on May 15, 2017. He also requested a certificate of aealability (COA), which the district court also denied in the same order.On June 12, 2017, Banister filed a motion to “amend or alter” the judgment of the district court ursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which the court denied on the merits on June 20, 2017.On July 20, 2017, Banister filed a notice of aeal and an alication for a COA, which the district court “considered” desite its revious order denying the COA, but again denied on July 28, 2017. Banister then sought and received from the Fifth Circuit an extension of time to file a COA alication. He filed a etition for a COA with the Fifth Circuit on October 11, 2017, and the court denied his etition, citing lack of jurisdiction, on May 8, 2018. The Fifth Circuit held that Banister’s urorted 59(e) motion was, in fact, a successive habeas etition, which would not toll the time for filing a notice of aeal. Citing the U.S. Sureme Court’s decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases200404-6432""""emGonzalez v. Crosbyem, 545 U.S. 524 (2005)a, the Fifth Circuit noted that “alleging that the court erred in denying habeas relief on the merits is effectively indistinguishable from alleging that the movant is, under the substantive rovisions of the statutes, entitled to habeas relief.”"
"Since it was ceded to the United States in 1898, Puerto Rico has accumulated substantial debt, in large art due to its ambiguous legal status as a rotectorate of the United States and the economically detrimental olicies the United States has enacted over the decades. Exacerbated by a series of governmental financial deficits and a recession, Puerto Rico’s debt crisis came to a head in 2015, when its governor announced that the Commonwealth was in a “death siral” and was unable to ay its debt. In June 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), which gave him authority to aoint a seven-member Financial Oversight and Management Board that would have control over Puerto Rico’s budget and would negotiate the restructuring of its $125 billion indebtedness. President Obama aointed the seven-member board in August 2016 based on lists sulied by Reublic and Democratic lawmakers.A number of creditors and elected officials of Puerto Rico have been dissatisfied with the board and its decisions and brought a lawsuit challenging President Obama’s authority to aoint the board members. The challengers alleged that the Aointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that the Senate confirm high-level federal officers and that the board members were within the scoe of this Clause. The federal district court in Puerto Rico ruled against the creditors, finding the board is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government established ursuant to Congress’s lenary owers under the Territorial Clause and that the board members are not “Officers of the United States.”The U.S. Court of Aeals for the First Circuit reversed, concluding that the Territorial Clause does not suersede the alication of the Aointments Clause in an unincororated territory and that the board members are “Officers of the United States” because: (1) they occuy “continuing ositions,” (2) exercise “significant authority” that is the same or more than that exercised by other officers the U.S. Sureme Court has found to be “Officers of the United States,” and (3) exercise their authority “ursuant to the laws of the United States.” Moreover, these officers are “rincial” officers subject to the Aointments Clause because they are answerable to and removable only by the President and are not directed or suervised by others who were aointed by the President with Senate confirmation."
"Named laintiff James Thole and others brought a class action lawsuit against U.S. Bank and other over alleged mismanagement of a defined benefit ension lan between 2007 and 2010. The laintiffs alleged that the defendants violated Section 404, 405, and 406 of the Emloyee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by breaching their fiduciary duties and causing the lan to engage in rohibited transactions with a subsidiary comany. The laintiffs argued that as a result of these rohibited transactions, the lan suffered significant losses and became underfunded in 2008.The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the comlaint, which the district court granted in art. However, the court ermitted the laintiffs to roceed with their claim that the defendants engaged in a rohibited transaction by investing in a subsidiary. In 2014, with the arties still in litigation, the lan became overfunded; that is, it contained more money than was needed to meet its obligations. The defendants raised the argument that the laintiffs had not suffered any financial loss and moved to dismiss the remainder of the action. The district court granted the motion, finding that the laintiffs lacked a concrete interest in any monetary relief the court could award to the lan if the laintiffs revailed. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed."
"Petitioner Noris Babb worked as a harmacist for the Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in Bay Pines, Florida, since 2004. While there, she heled to develo the Geriatric Pharmacotheray Clinic (GPC), which serves older veterans with diseases or disabilities common to individuals of advanced age with military service. In 2009, Pharmacy Management gave Babb an advanced scoe (full ractice authority) to rescribe medications without a hysician, which was necessary for her osition. In 2010, the VA rolled out a nationwide treatment initiative similar to the GPC Babb had heled develo. Against recommendations by Human Resources and desite requests from doctors, Pharmacy Management rejected alications by several current module harmacists—all females over 50—and granted alications of two harmacists under 40.Two of the female harmacists who were denied advancement filed Equal Emloyment Oortunity (EEO) comlaints, and Babb rovided statements and testified in suort of their EEO claims. The harmacists claimed that their non-selection urortedly for lack of advanced scoes was retext for discrimination and that any justification for denying advanced scoes was retext for discrimination as well.Babb alleged that as a result of her articiation in the EEO rocess, she was denied oortunities to articiate in the new rogram and that Pharmacy Management required her to agree to a schedule that was unworkable for her deartment. Unable to meet this requirement, Babb’s advanced scoe was removed and was consequently disqualified from romotion. A female harmacist under 30 without an advanced scoe was selected for the romotion.Babb brought this action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act of 1967 (ADEA) alleging that she was the victim of gender-lus-age discrimination and that the VA retaliated against her for articiating in rotected EEO in violation of those laws. The district court granted summary judgment for the VA. On aeal to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit, Babb argued that the district court erred in art by not allowing her to rove that illegal discrimination or retaliation was a “motivating factor” behind the VA’s refusal to romote her. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the lower court, finding itself bound by recedent that federal sector emloyees’ claims under ADEA and Title VII require that the laintiff show discrimination or retaliation is a “but for” factor in the adverse ersonnel action."
"Outokumu oerates a steel lant in Alabama that contains three “cold rolling mills,” which are required for manufacturing and rocessing certain steel roducts. In November 2007, while Outokumu’s lant was under construction, the comany’s redecessor, ThyssenKru, entered into three contracts with F.L. Industries (“Fives”) to rovide three different-sized mills. Each of these three contracts contains an arbitration clause that, among other things, requires that arbitration take lace in Dusseldorf, Germany, and that the forum aly the substantive law of Germany.The contracts define the arties to each as Outokumu and Fives and rovide that any mention of either arty also includes any subcontractors of that arty; aended to the contracts is a list of subcontractors, including etitioner GE Energy Conversion France SAS (“GE Energy”), formerly known as Converteam SAS.Fives contracted with GE Energy to rovide three motors for each of the three mills, for a total of nine motors, which were manufactured in France and delivered and installed in Alabama between 2011 and 2012. By June 2014, the motors began to fail, and by August 2015, motors in all three mills failed. It came to light that Fives and GE Energy had entered into a searate agreement with another arty that designated Fives to reresent the interests of all three arties in the event of a disute.Outokumu filed a lawsuit against GE Energy in Alabama state court in 2016, and GE Energy removed to federal court and moved to dismiss and comel arbitration. The district court granted GE Energy’s motion to comel and dismissed the action. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the 11th Circuit reversed and remanded as to the motion to comel, holding that the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards requires that the arbitration agreement be signed by the arties before Court or their rivities, and only under Chater 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act (which does not exressly restrict arbitration to the secific arties to an agreement) can arties comel arbitration through the doctrine of equitable estoel."
"This case arises from the scandal that became known as “Bridgegate.” Defendants William E. Baroni, Jr. and Bridget Anne Kelly consired to create major traffic jams in Fort Lee, New Jersey, after Fort Lee’s mayor refused to endorse the 2013 reelection bid of then-Governor Chris Christie. The defendants and others limited motorists’ access to the George Washington Bridge, the world’s busiest bridge, for four days during the first week of Fort Lee’s school year, resulting in extensive traffic delays.In 2015, a grand jury indicted Baroni and Kelly for their roles in the scheme. Each was charged with seven counts, including consiracy to obtain by fraud, knowingly convert, or intentionally misaly roerty of an organization receiving federal benefits, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and the substantive offense underlying that consiracy, 18 U.S.C § 666(a)(1)(A). A jury convicted the defendants on all counts. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the conviction as to four of the seven, including the two at issue here. In suort of its conclusion, the court reasoned that the defendants had defrauded the Port Authority of its roerty by citing a “traffic study” as the urose for the lane closures rather than their “real reason” of olitical ayback."
"Marcel and Lucky Brand are cometitors in the aarel industry, and this disute arises over Marcel’s allegation that Lucky Brand is infringing on its “Get Lucky” trademark through its use of “Lucky” on its merchandise in violation of an injunction entered in an earlier action between the two arties.In 2003, the two arties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve a trademark disute in which Lucky Brand agreed not to use “Get Lucky” and Marcel agreed to release certain claims it might have in the future arising out of its trademarks. The two arties contest the scoe of Marcel’s release of claims, with Marcel contending that it only released claims as to infringement that occurred rior to the 2003 execution of the agreement and Lucky Brand arguing that it released any future claim Marcel may have in relation to any trademark registered rior to the execution of the agreement. Further litigation ensued.In litigation between the two arties over substantially the same trademark disutes, Lucky Brand argued for its interretation of the 2003 settlement agreement. It moved to dismiss on the basis that because the marks at issue were registered rior to the settlement agreement, Marcel released any claim alleging infringement of those marks. The district court denied the motion, concluding that it was remature to determine which claims were subject to release in the 2001 agreement. However, the district court noted that Lucky Brand was “free to raise the issue . . . again after the record is more fully develoed.” Lucky Brand raised the defense again in its answer and as an affirmative defense, but not again during the litigation. After a jury trial, the district court entered judgment for Marcel, declaring that Lucky Brand infringed on Marcel’s “Get Lucky” trademark and enjoining Lucky Brand from using the “Get Lucky” mark. Lucky Brand did not aeal.In 2011, Marcel filed another lawsuit against Lucky Brand alleging that the latter continued to use “Lucky Brand” mark after the injunction. Lucky Brand moved for summary judgment on the basis that Marcel’s claims were recluded by res judicata in light of the final disosition of the revious action. The district court agreed, but the Second Circuit reversed, finding the allegedly barred claims “could not ossibly have been sued uon in the revious case.” On remand, Marcel filed a second amended comlaint, which Lucky Brand moved to dismiss on the sole basis that the 2001 agreement barred Marcel’s claims. The district court granted the motion and rejected Marcel’s argument that Lucky Brand was recluded from raising those claims.The Second Circuit vacated, concluding that the doctrine of claim reclusion (or more recisely, defense reclusion) alied in situations as this one and that it barred Lucky Brand from invoking its release defense again in this action."
"Petitioners Kendra Esinoza and others are low-income mothers who alied for scholarshis to kee their children enrolled in Stillwater Christian School, in Kalisell, Montana. The Montana legislature enacted a tax-credit scholarshi rogram in 2015 to rovide a modest tax credit to individuals and businesses who donate to rivate, nonrofit scholarshi organizations. Shortly after the rogram was enacted, the Montana Deartment of Revenue romulgated an administrative rule (“Rule 1”) rohibiting scholarshi reciients from using their scholarshis at religious schools, citing a rovision of the state constitution that rohibits “direct or indirect” ublic funding of religiously affiliated educational rograms.Esinoza and the other mothers filed a lawsuit in state court challenging Rule 1. The court determined that the scholarshi rogram was constitutional without Rule 1 and granted the laintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. On aeal, the Deartment of Revenue argued that the rogram is unconstitutional without Rule 1. The Montana Sureme Court agreed with the Deartment and reversed the lower court."
"Petitioner Romag Fasteners, Inc., sells magnetic sna fasteners for use in wallets, handbags, and other leather goods. Resondent Fossil designs, markets, and distributes fashion accessories, including handbags and small leather goods. In 2002, Fossil and Romag entered into an agreement to use Romag fasteners in Fossil’s roducts, and Fossil’s manufacturers urchased tens of thousands of Romag fasteners between 2002 and 2008. In 2010, the resident of Romag discovered that certain Fossil handbags sold in the United States contained counterfeit snas bearing the Romag mark. Romag sued Fossil in 2010 for atent and trademark infringement. Romag alleged that Fossil knowingly adoted and used the Romag mark without Romag’s consent.A jury found that Fossil had infringed Romag’s trademark and atents but that none of the violations were willful. The jury awarded Romag trademark damages under two theories: over $90,000 in rofits “to revent unjust enrichment” and over $6.7 million in rofits “to deter future trademark infringement.” For the latter award, the jury found that Fossil had acted with “callous disregard” for Romag’s trademark rights. However, the district court struck the jury’s award, finding that “a finding of willfulness remains a requirement for an award of defendants’ rofits in this Circuit.” On aeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed, finding that within the Second Circuit, a showing of willfulness was required for an award of rofits. Romag etitioned the U.S. Sureme Court for a writ of certiorari. In light of its decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201615-927""""emSCA Hygiene Products Aktiebolag v.

"United Western Bancor, Inc. (UWBI) was in Chater 7 bankrutcy roceedings when it received a tax refund check from the Internal Revenue Service that was the result of net oerating losses incurred by one of UWBI’s subsidiaries (United Western Bank). UWBI and its subsidiaries had entered into a tax allocation agreement in 2008 that was the source of the resent ownershi disute. The Federal Deosit Insurance Cororation (FDIC) alleged that, as receiver for the Bank, it was entitled to the federal tax refund that was due because the refund stemmed exclusively from the Bank’s business loss carrybacks. Simon Rodriguez, in his caacity as the Chater 7 Trustee for the bankrutcy estate of UWBI, initiated a bankrutcy adversary roceeding against the FDIC, alleging that UWBI owned the tax refund and thus that it was art of the bankrutcy estate.The bankrutcy court agreed with Rodriguez and entered summary judgment. The FDIC aealed to federal district court, which reversed the bankrutcy court. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court. Under federal common law, “a tax refund due from a joint return generally belongs to the comany resonsible for the losses that form the basis of the refund.” Alying this rule and noting that the agreement’s intended treatment of tax refunds mandates the same result, the Tenth Circuit concluded that the tax refund at issue belonged to the Bank and thus that the FDIC, as receiver for the Bank, was entitled to summary judgment."
"The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) rovides in relevant art that a erson who has three revious convictions for a “violent felony” or a “serious drug offense” shall serve a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in rison. In recent cases, the U.S. Sureme Court has adoted a “categorical” aroach to determine whether a rior conviction constitutes a “violent felony” within the ACCA. Under this aroach, the sentencing court must look only to the statutory definition of the rior offense and not to the articular facts underlying the rior convictions. At issue in this case is whether the categorical aroach alies to the determination of whether a rior conviction constitutes a “serious drug offense” as well.Eddie Lee Shular qualified as an armed career criminal on the basis of six rior Florida convictions for controlled substance offenses—five for sale of cocaine and one for ossession with intent to sell. None of these offenses required that the government rove that Shular had “knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance,” that is, that the substance ossessed or sold was cocaine. Under the categorical aroach, none of Shular’s Florida convictions would qualify as a “serious drug offense” because the Florida crimes are broader than the generic drug analogues under federal law. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected the categorical aroach to serious drug offenses, holding that the lain language of the ACCA definition “requires only that the redicate offense involve certain activities related to controlled substances.”"
"Sergio Adrián Hernández Güereca, a 15-year-old Mexican national, was laying with friends in the cement culvert between El Paso, Texas, and Cuidad Juarez, Mexico. Border Patrol Agent Jesus Mesa, Jr. arrived on the scene and detained one of Hernández’s friends on U.S. territory. Hernández ran into Mexican territory and stood by a illar near the culvert. From U.S. territory, Mesa fired at least two shots across the border at Hernández, one of which struck Hernández in the face and killed him.Hernández’s arents filed a lawsuit against the officer and various other defendants alleging violation of their son’s Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. The district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed and art and reversed in art. The Fifth Circuit held that Hernández lacked Fourth Amendment rights, but his arents were entitled to a remedy under a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases1970301""""emBivens v. Six Unknown Named Agentsem, 403 U.S. 388 (1971)a (holding an imlied cause of action against federal government officials who have violated the laintiff’s constitutional rights), and the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity. On rehearing en banc, the full Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the arents’ claims, holding that they had failed to state a claim for a violation of the Fourth Amendment and that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity because it was not “clearly established” that it was unconstitutional for an officer on U.S. soil to shoot a Mexican national on Mexican soil.The U.S. Sureme Court granted certiorari in 2016 and reversed the en banc Fifth Circuit as to qualified immunity. The Court remanded the case so the lower court could determine whether the shooting violated Hernández’s Fourth Amendment rights and whether his arents could assert claims for damages under emBivensem. On remand, the en banc Fifth Circuit once again affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the comlaint, holding that the excessive force claim was unlike any that had been decided reviously and thus the laintiffs were not entitled to any remedy under emBivensem. In so holding, the Fifth Circuit alied the Sureme Court’s decision in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201615-1358""""emZiglar v.

"In 2012, the U.S. Deartment of Homeland Security (DHS) adoted a rogram—known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—to ostone the deortation of undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children and to assign them work ermits allowing them to obtain social security numbers, ay taxes, and become art of “mainstream” society in the United States.In 2017, after the national election, when the Trum administration relaced the Obama administration, DHS began a hase-out of DACA. The arties do not disute the authority of a new administration to relace old olicies with new olicies, but the laintiffs in this and related challenges allege that the new administration terminated DACA based on a mistake of law rather than in comliance with the law. Secifically, the Trum administration terminated DACA based on a conclusion that the Obama administration had created DACA “without roer statutory authority and with no established end-date” and thus that it was an “unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.”The laintiffs in this case and the related cases challenged this conclusion of law, alleging that the recission of DACA violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it was arbitrary and caricious, and because it was a substantive rule that did not comly with the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements. The challengers also alleged that the recission derived DACA reciients of constitutionally rotected liberty and roerty interests without due rocess of law and violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was motivated by discriminatory animus.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the government’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the DACA recission was not “committed to agency discretion by law” and that there was “law to aly.” Further, the Ninth Circuit granted laintiffs a reliminary injunction restoring DACA, finding that the laintiffs were likely to win on the merits of their arguments, they would suffer irrearable harm in the absence of reliminary relief, the balance of equities tis in the laintiffs’ favor, and the injunction is in the ublic interest."
"In June 2014, Louisiana assed Act 620, which required “that every hysician who erforms or induces an abortion shall ‘have active admitting rivileges at a hosital that is located not further than thirty miles from the location at which the abortion is erformed or induced.’”Several abortion clinics and doctors challenged Act 620, and while that challenge was ending in the district court, the U.S. Sureme Court struck down a “nearly identical” Texas law in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201515-274""""emWhole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedtem (emWWHem)a, finding that the Texas law imosed an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to have an abortion while bringing about no “health-related benefit” and serving no “relevant credentialing function.” The district court hearing the challenge to Act 620 accordingly declared Act 620 facially invalid and ermanently enjoined its enforcement.The district court made detailed findings of fact and determined that “admitting rivileges also do not serve ‘any relevant credentialing function,’” and that “hysicians are sometimes denied rivileges … for reasons unrelated to [medical] cometency.” The district court further determined that the law would “drastically burden women’s right to choose abortions.”A anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit the anel majority reviewed the evidence de novo and concluded that the district court erred by overlooking “remarkabl[e] differen[ces]” between the facts in this case and in emWWHem. The anel concluded that “no clinics will likely be forced to close on account of the Act,” and thus, the law would not imose an undue burden on women’s right to choose abortions.

"The Aalachian Trail sans over 2,000 miles, from Maine to Georgia, with aroximately 1,000 miles of the Trail crossing through lands within national forests. Under the National Trails System Act, the Secretary of the Interior has the resonsibility to administer the trail and that resonsibility may not be transferred to any other federal agencies. The Mineral Leasing Act grants the U.S. Forest Service the authority to grant certain rights-of-way through lands in the National Forest System, but no federal agency has the authority to grant equivalent rights-of-way through lands in the National Park System.In 2017, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Atlantic Coast Pieline LLC (Atlantic) authorization to construct, oerate, and maintain a natural gas ieline that would cross the Aalachian Trail at oints located within the George Washington and Monogahela National Forests. After a review rocess, the Forest Service authorized Atlantic to roceed with construction of the ieline, finding it had authority under the Mineral Leasing Act to grant a right-of-way for the ieline and that the ieline “would have no long lasting imacts” on the Trail.Cowasture River Preservation Association and others filed a etition in the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit for review of the Forest Service’s record of decision and secial use ermit. The court granted the etition, vacated the record of decision and secial use ermit, and remanded to the Forest Service. Notably, the court determined that the Forest Service lacked authority to grant the right-of-way under the Mineral Leasing Act because the Aalachian Trail is a “unit” of the National Park System. The court determined that the Mineral Leasing Act “secifically excludes” the Trail “from the authority of the Secretary of the Interior ‘or aroriate agency head’ to grant ieline rights of way.”The Court consolidated this case for oral argument with emU.S. Forest Service v.

"Evelyn Sineneng-Smith oerated an immigration consulting firm in San Jose, California. Her clients were mostly natives of the Philiines, who were unlawfully emloyed in the United States and were seeking to obtain legal ermanent residence (green cards). Sineneng-Smith urorted to hel her clients obtain ermanent residence through the Labor Certification rocess, but that rogram exired on Aril 30, 2001. Sineneng-Smith knew that the rogram had exired but nonetheless continued to tell clients that they could obtain green cards via Labor Certifications.Federal law rohibits encouraging or inducing an alien to reside in the country, knowing and in reckless disregard of the fact that such residence is in violation of the law. Sineneng-Smith was indicted, charged, and convicted by a jury of violating this law. She aealed her conviction, and the U.S. Court of Aeals solicited sulemental briefing on several constitutional questions resented in the aeal. The court held that the statute was overbroad in violation of the First Amendment, criminalizing a “substantial amount of rotected exression in relation to the statute’s narrow legitimate swee.”"
"Nidal Khalid Nasrallah, a native and citizen of Lebanon, was 17 years old when he entered the United States on a tourist visa in 2006. He became a lawful ermanent resident the following year.In 2011, ursuant to a lea bargain agreement, Nasrallah leaded guilty to two counts of receiving stolen roerty in interstate commerce. An immigration judge determined that one of those convictions made Nasrallah subject to removal as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turitude, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i). However, the judge also found Nasrallah had established a clear robability that he would be tortured and ersecuted in Lebanon by grous such as Hezbollah and ISIS because of his Druze religion and western ties, so the judge granted him a deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture. Both the government and Nasrallah aealed the IJ's decision to the Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA). On aeal, the BIA held that the immigration judge erred in granting Nasrallah a deferral, and it ordered his removal.Nasrallah aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Reviewing the BIA’s conclusions of law de novo, the Eleventh Circuit denied in art and dismissed in art Nasrallah’s etition for review. Secifically, Nasrallah had asked the court to reweigh the factors involved in the removal order, but under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2), the courts lack jurisdiction to review the factual findings underlying the denial of removal relief. The court therefore dismissed Nasrallah’s claim for lack of jurisdiction."

The district court further noted that these dismissals were “strikes” under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g), which bars inmates from filing or aealing a federal civil action without aying the associated fees if they have filed three or more cases or aeals that were dismissed because the lawsuits were frivolous or malicious or did not roerly state a legal claim for relief. Because of the revious strikes, the court ordered Lomax to show cause before roceeding in forma aueris. In resonse to the show cause order, Lomax argued (among other things) that because the rior dismissals were without rejudice, they do not count as strikes.The district court denied Lomax’s motion as barred by the three-strikes rovision, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed."
"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was investigating Seila Law LLC, a law firm that rovides debt-relief services, among others. As art of its investigation, the CFPB issued a civil investigative demand to Seila Law that requires the firm to resond to several interrogatories and requests for documents. Seila Law refused to comly with the demand, so the CFPB filed a etition in the district court to enforce comliance. The district court granted the etition and ordered Seila Law to comly with the CID. Seila Law aealed the district court’s order on two grounds, one of which was that the CFPB is unconstitutionally structured.Secifically, Seila Law argued that the CFPB’s structure violates the Constitution’s searation of owers because it is an indeendent agency headed by a single Director who exercises substantial executive ower but can be removed by the President only for cause. The Ninth Circuit disagreed.The court found two Sureme Court decisions on searation of owers controlling: Humhrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), and Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988). According to the Ninth Circuit anel, those cases indicate that the for-cause removal restriction rotecting the CFPB’s Director does not “imede the President’s ability to erform his constitutional duty” to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed."
"Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam is a native and citizen of Sri Lanka and a Tamil, an ethnic minority grou in Sri Lanka. Thuraissigiam entered the United States via its southern border, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers arrested him and laced him in exedited removal roceedings. Thuraissigiam indicated a fear of ersecution in Sri Lanka, but an asylum officer determined he had not established a credible fear of ersecution and referred him for removal. A suervisor affirmed the officer’s finding, and an immigration judge affirmed it as well in a check-box decision.Thuraissigiam filed a habeas etition in federal district court, arguing that his exedited removal order violated his statutory, regulatory, and constitutional rights. The district court dismissed the etition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e) did not authorize jurisdiction over Thuraissigiam’s claims and rejecting his argument that the removal rocess to which he was subjected effectively susended the writ of habeas corus, in violation of the Susension Clause.A anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court. Because the administrative scheme governing credible fear determinations in this context is “meager,” and § 1252(a)(2) disallows judicial review of whether DHS comlied with the rocedures, the rocess does not meet minimum constitutional requirements."
"Charles Liu oerated an EB-5 fund, which is a fund that offers lawful ermanent residence oortunities to foreigners who make significant investments in the United States. However, Liu misaroriated millions of dollars that had been invested in the fund, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, which rohibits the making of false statements in the context of a securities offering.The district court ordered Liu to “disgorge” (ay back) $26 million, the amount investors had aid into the EB-5 fund, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. In etitioning the Sureme Court’s review, Liu argued that the SEC lacked the authority to obtain disgorgement, under the Court’s 2017 decision in emKokesh v. SECem, which held that disgorgement awarded under the court’s equitable ower is a enalty, not a remedial measure."
"Booking.com oerates a website on which customers can make travel and lodging reservations and has used the name BOOKING.COM since at least 2006. In 2011 and 2012, Booking.com filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) four trademark alications for the use of BOOKING.COM as a word mark and for stylized versions of the mark.Under the Lanham Act, marks must be “distinctive” to be eligible for rotection, and generic terms are not distinctive. The USPTO examiner rejected Booking.com’s alications, finding that the marks were not rotectable because BOOKING.COM was generic as alied to the services for which it sought registration (online hotel reservation services, among others).The Lanham Act also allows rotection for “descritive” terms that have acquired secondary meaning, or a mental association in the minds of consumers between the roosed mark and the source of the roduct or service. In the alternative, the USPTO concluded that the marks were merely descritive and that Booking.com had failed to establish that they had acquired secondary meaning as required for trademark rotection.Booking.com aealed to the Trademark Trial and Aeal Board, which affirmed the rejection of Booking.com’s alications. The Board found that BOOKING.COM was a generic term for these tyes of services and therefore ineligible for trademark rotection. Because “booking” generically refers to “a reservation or arrangement to buy a travel ticket or stay in a hotel room” and “.com” indicates a commercial website, the Board reasoned that consumers would understand the resulting term “BOOKING.COM” to refer to an online reservation service for travel—the very services roosed in Booking.com’s alications. The district court reversed, ruling Booking.com had acquired secondary meaning. A anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit the district court's reversal."
"When Google imlemented its Android Oerating System (Android OS), it wrote its own rogramming language based on Java, which is owned by Oracle. To facilitate develoers writing their own rograms for Android OS, Google’s version used the same names, organization, and functionality as Java's Alication Programming Interfaces (APIs).Oracle sued Google for coyright infringement, but the federal district judge held that APIs are not subject to coyright because ermitting a rivate entity to own the coyright to a rogramming language would stifle innovation and collaboration, contrary to the goals of coyright. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the lower court, finding that the Java APIs are coyrightable but leaving oen the ossibility of a fair use defense. The U.S. Sureme Court denied Google’s etition for certiorari.Uon remand to the district court, a jury found that Google's use of the Java API was fair use. Oracle aealed, and the Federal Circuit again reversed the lower court. The Federal Circuit held that Google's use was not fair as a matter of law."
"In 2014, a general court-martial comosed of a military judge alone found Michael Briggs guilty of rae in violation of Article 120(a), Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. § 920(a) (2000), for conduct that occurred nine years earlier, in 2005. The UCMJ allows for a military offense that is unishable by death to be “tried and unished at any time without limitation.” In contrast, other military offenses are subject to a five-year statute of limitations.Relying on the Sureme Court’s decision in Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584 (1977), which held that the Eighth Amendment rohibited a death sentence for rae of an adult woman, Briggs argued on aeal that rae was not “unishable by death” and thus was subject to the five-year statute of limitations for non-caital crimes. The United States Air Force Court of Criminal Aeals (AFCCA) rejected his challenge because Briggs had not raised the statute of limitations claim at trial. The court therefore affirmed the finding and sentence of the judge below. Briggs aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Armed Forces. Reviewing for lain error, the C.A.A.F. reversed the lower court, finding that the Rules for Courts-Martial R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(B) requires the military judge to inform the accused of the right to assert the statute of limitations. As such, the court found that if the military judge had informed Briggs of a ossible statute of limitations defense, he would have sought dismissal."
"The laintiffs, Muslim men born outside of the U.S. but living lawfully inside the country, allege that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) laced their names on the national “No Fly List,” desite osing no threat to aviation, in retaliation for their refusal to become FBI informants reorting on fellow Muslims. They sued the agents in their official and individual caacities in U.S. federal court under the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the RFRA. They claim that the listing of their names substantially burdened their exercise of religion, in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), because their refusal was comelled by Muslim tenets. Under RFRA, “[a] erson whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial roceeding and obtain aroriate relief against a government.” The U.S. District Court dismissed the claims against the agents in Aeals for the Second Circuit, a anel of which reversed the lower court. One of the agents, Tanzin, moved for rehearing en banc, which the court denied, over the dissent of several judges."
"Petitioners Daniel D. Glasser, Norton I. Kretske, and Alfred E. Roth were Assistant United States Attorneys in the Northern District of Illinois, secializing in liquor and revenue offenses. They, along with Anthony Horton, a rofessional bondsman, and Louis Kalan, an automobile allegedly engaged in illicit alcohol trafficking around Chicago, were found guilty and sentenced for consiracy to defraud the United States and consiracy to bribery.In a joint trial, Glasser was reresented by William Scott Stewart and George Callaghan. Kretske was originally reresented by the firm “Harrington &am; McDonnell, but Kretske was dissatisfied with the firm, and the trial judge roosed aointing Stewart to reresent Kretske (in addition to Glasser, whom Stewart was already reresenting). Glasser objected to the aointment, arguing (through Stewart) that that there would be a conflict of interest in reresenting both defendants. The judge aointed Stewart to reresent Kretske over Glasser’s objection.A jury of 11 men and one woman convicted all five defendants of consiracy to defraud the United States, and the judge denied the defendants’ motion for a new trial.The Seventh Circuit affirmed the convictions."
"Alaska law imoses certain limits on olitical contributions. Secifically, it limits contributions made by individuals to olitical candidates, contributions made by individuals to election-related grous, olitical arty-to-candidate contributions, and the total funds a candidate may receive from out-of-state residents.Three individuals and a division of the Alaska Reublican Party challenged these four rovisions, arguing that they violate the First Amendment. The district court uheld all four rovisions. On aeal, a anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the individual-to-candidate and individual-to-grou limits, as well as the olitical-arty-to-candidate limit. However, it reversed as to the out-of-state resident limit. The court reasoned that the first three limits are narrowly tailored to revent actual or the aearance of quid ro quo corrution and thus do not imermissibly infringe constitutional rights. In contrast,  the nonresident limit does not target an “imortant state interest” and therefore violates the First Amendment."
"James R. Adams is a resident of Delaware and member of that state’s bar. Adams considered alying for a judicial osition but ultimately decided not to because the state required the candidate to be a Reublican, and Adams was neither a Reublican nor a Democrat.Adams filed a lawsuit against the governor, challenging the rovision of the Delaware Constitution that limits judicial service to members of the Democratic and Reublican Parties. First, the district court held Adams had Article III (“constitutional”) standing as to some, but not all of the rovisions, but that because he had rudential standing to the other rovisions, it would consider his challenge as to all of them. Turning to the merits, the district court noted that under the U.S. Sureme Court’s recedent in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases197574-1520""""emElrod v. Burnsema and a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases197574-1520""""emBranti v. Finkelema, a government emloyer may not make emloyment decisions based on olitical allegiance excet with resect to olicymakers. The court found that a judge’s job is to aly, rather than create, the law, and thus that judges do not fall within the olicymaking excetion of Elrod and Burns. As such, the court found the rovision unconstitutional in its entirety.On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in art and reversed only as to the rovisions for which Adams lacked Article III standing."
"Jimcy McGirt, a member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation was convicted of sex crimes against a child by the state of Oklahoma within the historical Creek Nation boundaries. He argued that Oklahoma could not exercise jurisdiction over him because under the Indian Major Crimes Act, any crime involving a Native American victim or eretrator, or occurring within recognized reservation boundaries, is subject to federal jurisdiction, not state jurisdiction."
"The U.S. House of Reresentatives Committee on Oversight and Reform issued a suboena to Mazars USA, the accounting firm for Donald Trum (in his caacity as a rivate citizen) and several of his businesses, demanding rivate financial records belonging to Trum. According to the Committee, the requested documents would inform its investigation into whether Congress should amend or sulement its ethics-in-government laws. Trum argued that the information serves no legitimate legislative urose and sued to revent Mazars from comlying with the suboena.The district court granted summary judgment for the Committee, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed, finding the Committee ossesses the authority under both the House Rules and the Constitution.In the consolidated case, Trum v. Deutsche Bank AG, No. 19-760, two committees of the U.S. House of Reresentatives—the Committee on Financial Services and the Intelligence Committee—issued a suboena to the creditors of President Trum and several of his businesses. The district court denied Trum’s motion for a reliminary injunction to revent comliance with the suboenas, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in substantial art and remanded in art."
"The district attorney of New York County issued a grand jury suboena to an accounting firm that ossessed the financial records of President Donald Trum and one of his businesses. Trum asked a federal court to restrain enforcement of that suboena, but the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction and dismissed the case based on Sureme Court recedent regarding federal intrusion into ongoing state criminal rosecutions. The court held, in the alternative, that there was no constitutional basis to temorarily restrain or reliminarily enjoin the suboena at issue.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the lower court with resect to the alternative holding, finding that any residential immunity from state criminal rocess does not extend to investigative stes like the grand jury suboena. However, it found that the Sureme Court recedent on which the lower court relied did not aly to the situation and vacated the judgment as to that issue and remanded the case to the lower court."
"The Alliance for Oen Society International and other organizations receive funding from the U.S. government to hel with their mission of fighting HIVAIDS abroad. The government rovides the funds on the condition that “no funds be used to rovide assistance to any grou or organization that does not have a olicy exlicitly oosing rostitution and sex trafficking.” In emU.S. Agency for International Develoment v. Alliance for Oen Society International Inc.em, decided in 2013, the Court held that the condition comelled seech in violation of the First Amendment. Although the government consequently did not aly the condition to Alliance for Oen Society International, it continued to aly the condition to the organization’s foreign affiliates. The organization sued, asking for ermanent injunctive relief. The district court granted the requested relief, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
"Agnes Deirdre Morrissey-Berru was an teacher at Our Lady of Guadalue School and brought a claim against the school under the Age Discrimination in Emloyment Act (ADEA). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the school on the basis that Morrissey-Berru was a “minister.” In Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &am; School v. EEOC, the Sureme Court first recognized a ministerial excetion, which exemts religious institutions from anti-discrimination laws in hiring emloyees deemed “ministers.”The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the lower court, finding that Morrissey-Berru was not a “minister”; she had taken one course on the history of the Catholic church but otherwise did not have any religious credential, training, or ministerial background. Given that she did not hold herself out to the ublic as a religious leader or minister, the court declined to classify her as a minister for the uroses of the ministerial excetion."
"In 2014, Roxanne Torres was involved in an incident with olice officers in which she was oerating a vehicle under the influence of methamhetamine and in the rocess of trying to get away, endangered the two officers ursuing her. In the rocess, one of the officers shot and injured her. Torres leaded no contest to three crimes: (1) aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer, (2) assault on a olice officer, and (3) unlawfully taking a motor vehicle.In October 2016, she filed a civil-rights comlaint in federal court against the two officers, alleging claims including excessive force and consiracy to engage in excessive force. Construing Torres’s comlaint as asserting the excessive-force claims under the Fourth Amendment, the court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. In the court’s view, the officers had not seized Torres at the time of the shooting, and without a seizure, there could be no Fourth Amendment violation. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed."
"The City of Chicago towed and imounded the Robbin Fulton’s vehicle for a rior citation of driving on a susended license. Fulton filed a Chater 13 bankrutcy action treating the City as an unsecured creditor. The City filed an unsecured roof of claim, and the bankrutcy court confirmed Fulton’s lan. The City then amended its roof of claim and asserted its status as a secured creditor. It refused to return Fulton’s vehicle, and Fulton filed a motion for sanctions against the City.The bankrutcy court held that the City was obligated to return the vehicle under emThomson v. General Motors Accetance Cor.em, 566 F.3d 699 (7th Cir. 2009), a binding case in which the Seventh Circuit had held that a creditor must comly with the automatic stay and return a debtor’s vehicle uon her filing of a bankrutcy etition. The City moved to stay the order in federal district court, and the court denied its request. The Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court’s judgment denying the City's request."
"Clemente Avelino Pereida, a native and citizen of Mexico, leaded no contest to a criminal charge in Nebraska, arising from his attemt to use a fraudulent social security card to obtain emloyment. The Deartment of Homeland Security initiated removal roceedings against Pereida, and Pereida sought cancellation of the removal alication. At issue is whether Pereida's criminal attemt conviction qualifies as a crime involving moral turitude; if so, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, Pereida would be ineligible for cancellation of removal.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eighth Circuit held that it was Pereida’s burden to establish his eligibility for cancellation of removal. However, the court determined that it was not ossible to ascertain which statutory subsection formed the basis for Pereida's conviction, so Pereida failed to meet his burden. Because Pereida did not establish that he was eligible for cancellation of removal, the court uheld the Board of Immigration Aeals’ determination that he did not show such eligibility and denied Pereida’s etition for review."
"In 2006, Petitioner Manfredo M. Salinas alied for a disability annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act, but the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (“the Board”) denied his alication. After the filing eriod had exired, Salinas sought reconsideration, which the Board also denied, based on its conclusion that Salinas had not shown good cause for missing the deadline. Salinas did not ursue any further action on his alication, so the Board’s denial became a final decision on February 9, 2007.Nearly seven years later, in 2013, Salinas filed a new alication for a disability annuity. The Board granted him an annuity, but Salinas aealed the annuity's beginning date and amount. During that aeal, Salinas asked the Board to reoen all its decisions on his rior alications, including the decision denying his 2006 alication. After a hearing, a Board hearing officer concluded that Salinas's 2006 alication was beyond the four-year timeframe for reoening based on new and material evidence or administrative error under the Board's regulations. Salinas then asked the U.S. Court of Aeals to review the Board's decision not to reoen his 2006 alication. Following its own binding recedent holding that it lacked jurisdiction to review a Board decision declining to reoen a rior benefits claim, the Fifth Circuit dismissed Salinas’s etition."
"Congress enacted the Telehone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 to address intrusive and unwanted hone calls to Americans. One rovision of that Act—the automatic call ban—rohibits hone calls to cell hones that use “any automatic telehone dialing system or an artificial or rerecorded voice.” As assed, the Act recognized two excetions to the ban: automated calls “for emergency uroses” and those made to a cell hone with “the rior exress consent of the called arty.” In 2015, Congress amended the Act to add a third excetion for calls made to cell hones “to collect a debt owed to or guaranteed by the United States.” Moreover, automated calls made by the federal government itself are not barred by the automated call ban.The American Association of Political Consultants, Inc. challenged this third rovision of the Act, alleging that it violates the Free Seech Clause of the First Amendment by imosing a content-based restriction on seech. The district court granted summary judgment to the government, finding unersuasive the free seech argument. The district court alied strict scrutiny review (testing whether the government had demonstrated the law is necessary to a """"comelling state interest,"""" that the law is """"narrowly tailored"""" to achieving this comelling urose, and that the law uses the """"least restrictive means"""" to achieve that urose) to the debt-collection exemtion and ruled that it does not violate the Free Seech Clause. On aeal the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed with the lower court that strict scrutiny review alied but concluded that the debt-collection exemtion does not satisfy that level of review. Finding that the rovision was severable from the Act, the Fourth Circuit struck down only that rovision."
"In 2015, Markkaya Jean Gullett, a Montana resident, was driving a Ford Exlorer on a Montana highway when the tread on one of her tires searated. She lost control of the vehicle and died as a result of the vehicle rolling into a ditch.The ersonal reresentative of Gullett’s estate sued Ford Motor Co. in Montana state court, alleging design-defect, failure-to-warn, and negligence claims. Ford moved to dismiss the claims for lack of ersonal jurisdiction.For a state court to have ersonal jurisdiction over a defendant, the Due Process Clause requires that the court have either general ersonal jurisdiction or secific ersonal jurisdiction. A court has general ersonal jurisdiction over a cororate defendant if the defendant’s headquarters are within the state or if it is incororated in the state. A court has secific ersonal jurisdiction over a cororate defendant if the laintiff’s claims “arise out of or relate to” the defendant’s activities within the state.Ford Motor Co. has its headquarters in Michigan and is incororated in Delaware. Ford assembled the vehicle in Kentucky and first sold it to a dealershi in Washington State. The dealershi then sold it to an Oregon resident, who later sold the vehicle to a urchaser who brought it to Montana.The district court denied Ford’s motion to dismiss, finding a “connection between the forum and the secific claims at issue.” The Montana Sureme Court affirmed, reasoning that by advertising and selling arts within the state of Montana, Ford had availed itself of the rivilege of doing business in that state and was therefore subject to secific jurisdiction there.This case is consolidated with emFord Motor Comany v. Bandemerem, No. 19-369, which arises in Minnesota but resents the same legal question."
"The Women’s Health Amendment to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that women's health insurance include coverage for reventive health care, including contracetion. The rule rovided that a nonrofit religious emloyer who objects to roviding contracetive services may file an accommodation form requesting an exemtion to the requirement, thereby avoiding aying for or otherwise articiating in the rovision of contracetion to its emloyees.In a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201313-354""""emBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.em, 573 U.S. 682 (2014)a, the Sureme Court held that under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), closely-held for-rofit cororations were also entitled to invoke the exemtion if they had sincere religious objections to the rovision of contracetive coverage. Then, in emWheaton College v. Burwellem, 573 U.S. 958, (2014), the Court held that an entity seeking an exemtion did not need to file the accommodation form; rather, its notification to the Deartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) was sufficient to receive the exemtion. HHS and the Deartments of Labor and Treasury romulgated a final rule in comliance with these rulings.Then, in aemZubik v. Burwellem, 578 U.S. __ (2017)a, the Court considered another challenge to the rule, which asserted that merely submitting the accommodation notice “substantially burden[ed] the exercise of their religion,” in violation of RFRA. In a er curiam oinion, the Court declined to reach the merits of that question.In 2017, the Deartment of Health and Human Services under the Trum administration romulgated regulations that greatly exanded the entities eligible to claim an exemtion to the requirement that grou health insurance lans cover contracetive services. The new rules, which the agencies romulgated without issuing a notice of roosed rulemaking or soliciting ublic comment, exanded the scoe of the religious exemtion and added a “moral” exemtion.Pennsylvania and New Jersey challenged the rules in federal district court, alleging that they violate the Constitution, federal anti-discrimination law, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). After a hearing and reviewing evidence, the district court issued a nationwide injunction enjoining the rules’ enforcement, finding the states were likely to succeed on their APA claim. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.This case is consolidated with a similar case, emTrum v. Pennsylvaniaem, No. 19-454, resenting the same legal question."
"Under Washington State law, each olitical arty with residential candidates is required to nominate for the Electoral College electors from its arty equal to the number of senators and reresentatives allotted to the state. Nominees must ledge to vote for the candidate of their arty, and any nominee who does not vote for their arty candidate is subject to a fine of u to $1,000. Washington, as is the case with all but two other states, has a “winner-take-all” electoral system, which means that all of a state’s electoral votes go to the winner of the oular vote in that state.In the 2016 Presidential Election, etitioner Chiafolo and others were nominated as residential electors for the Washington State Democratic Party. When Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine won the oular vote in Washington State, the electors were required by law to cast their ballots for ClintonKaine. Instead, they voted for Colin Powell for President and a different individual for Vice President. The Washington secretary of state fined the electors $1,000 each for failing to vote for the nominee of their arty in violation of state law.The electors challenged the law imosing the fine as violating the First Amendment. An administrative law judge uheld the fine, and a state trial court on aeal affirmed.This case was originally consolidated with a similar case arising in Colorado, emColorado Deartment of State v. Bacaem, No. 19-518, but is no longer consolidated as of the Court's order of March 10, 2020."
"In March 2018, the City of Philadelhia barred Catholic Social Services (CSS) from lacing children in foster homes because of its olicy of not licensing same-sex coules to be foster arents. CSS sued the City of Philadelhia, asking the court to order the city to renew their contract. CSS argued that its right to free exercise of religion and free seech entitled it to reject qualified same-sex coules because they were same-sex coules, rather than for any reason related to their qualifications to care for children.The district court denied CSS’s motion for a reliminary injunction, and the Third Circuit affirmed, finding that the City’s non-discrimination olicy was a neutral, generally alicable law and that CSS had not demonstrated that the City targeted CSS for its religious beliefs or was motivated by ill will against its religion."
"Industrial facilities, ower lants, and other manufacturing comlexes use water from lakes, rivers, estuaries, and oceans to cool their facilities through cooling water intake structures. Because these structures otentially cause significant harm to aquatic life, Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate their design and oeration. In Aril 2011, the EPA roosed new regulations for cooling water intake structures. As art of the rule-making rocess and required by Section 7 of the Endangered Secies Act, in 2012, the EPA consulted with the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service about the otential imacts of the regulations and roduced a written biological oinion on the imacts of the roosed agency action.The Sierra Club made a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for records generated during the EPA’s rule-making rocess, including the documents generated as art of the consultation with the Services. The Services withheld some of the requested records, citing Exemtion 5 of FOIA, which shields from disclosure documents subject to the “deliberative rocess rivilege.” The district court determined that 12 of the 16 requested records were not rotected to the rivilege and ordered disclosure. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s order to disclose some of the records but reversed as to two of the records."
"Police caught Charles Borden, Jr., with a istol during a traffic sto in Aril 2017, and he subsequently leaded guilty ossessing that firearm as a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). At sentencing, the government recommended sentencing Borden as an armed career criminal, under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), based on three rior Tennessee aggravated assault convictions. Borden objected, arguing that one of his rior convictions—reckless aggravated assault—did not qualify as a “violent felony” under the “use of force” clause of the ACCA. Borden argued that reckless aggravated assault requires only a mental state of recklessness, and reckless use of force does not amount to a crime of violence under the ACCA. Retroactively alying Sixth Circuit recedent holding that reckless aggravated assault does constitute a violent felony under the “use of force” clause of the ACCA, the district court held that all three of Borden’s aggravated assault victims constituted “crime[s] of violence” under the ACCA and designated him as an armed career criminal. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed."
"In 2012, the U.S. Sureme Court uheld the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) against a constitutional challenge by characterizing the enalty for not buying health insurance as a tax, which Congress has the ower to imose. In 2017, the Reublican-controlled Congress enacted an amendment to the ACA that set the enalty for not buying health insurance to zero, but it left the rest of the ACA in lace. Texas and several other states and individuals filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the individual mandate again, arguing that because the enalty was zero, it can no longer be characterized as a tax and is therefore unconstitutional. California and several other states joined the lawsuit to defend the individual mandate.The federal district court held that the individual mandate is now unconstitutional and that as a result, the entire ACA is invalidated because the individual mandate cannot be “severed” from the rest of the Act. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit uheld the district court’s conclusion but remanded the case for reconsideration of whether any art of the ACA survives in the absence of the individual mandate.

"When Brett Jones was fifteen years old, he stabbed his grandfather to death. He was convicted of murder, and the Circuit Court of Lee County, Mississii, imosed a mandatory sentence of life imrisonment, and Mississii law made him ineligible for arole. The aellate court affirmed his conviction and sentence. In a ost-conviction relief roceeding, the Sureme Court of Mississii ordered that Jones be resentenced after a hearing to determine whether he was entitled to arole eligibility. Subsequently, the U.S. Sureme Court decided a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201110-9646""""emMiller v. Alabamaem, 567 U.S. 460 (2012),a and a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201514-280""""emMontgomery v. Louisianaem, 577 U.S. __ (2016)a. In emMillerem, the Court held that mandatory life in rison without the ossibility of arole sentences for juveniles violated the Eighth Amendment’s rohibition on cruel and unusual unishments. And in emMontgomeryem, it clarified that emMillerem barred life without the ossibility of arole “for all but the rarest of juvenile offenders, those whose crimes reflect ermanent incorrigibility.” The circuit court held the hearing weighing the factors laid out in emMillerem and determined Jones was not entitled to arole eligibility."
"Two undercover FBI agents mistakenly identified etitioner James King as a criminal susect and aroached him. The arties differed in their account of the facts as to whether the agents identified themselves as olice officers, but King aarently erceived he was being mugged and resisted their attemts to restrain him. A violent fight ensued, in which the officers severely beat King until onlookers called 911 and local olice arrived on the scene. The local olice officers ordered bystanders to delete video footage of the altercation because the videos could reveal the identities of undercover FBI officers. King was taken to the hosital, where he received medical treatment and was discharged. On his discharge, olice arrested him and took him to Kent County Jail, where he sent the weekend in jail before osting bail and visiting another hosital for further examination. Prosecutors ursued charges, but a jury acquitted King of all charges.King then filed a lawsuit against the United States and both FBI agents, alleging that the agents violated his clearly established Fourth Amendment rights by conducting an unreasonable seizure and by using excessive force. In general, the United States and its agents are immune from liability under the rincile of sovereign immunity. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives sovereign immunity in secific situations, and the laintiff bringing an FTCA claim bears the burden of showing his claim falls within such situations. The FTCA also contains a “judgment bar” rovision that recludes a laintiff from bringing additional claims concerning the “same subject matter” as an FTCA claim after a judgment is entered on the FTCA claim.The district court found that King failed to rove one of the six requirements for FTCA to aly, and therefore that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to hear King’s claim against the United States. The court further held that the defendant agents were entitled to qualified immunity and granted summary judgment in their favor. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, finding the FTCA judgment bar does not reclude King’s remaining claims because the court did not reach the merits of the FTCA claims and that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity."
"Michael Baca, Polly Baca, and Robert Nemanich were aointed as three of Colorado’s nine residential electors for the 2016 general election. Colorado law requires residential electors to cast their votes for the winner of the oular vote in the state for President and Vice President. When Hillary Clinton won the oular vote in that state, instead of casting his vote for her, Mr. Baca cast his vote for John Kasich. The Colorado Secretary of State discarded his vote and removed him as an elector. As a result, Ms. Baca and Mr. Nemanich voted for Hillary Clinton, desite their desire to vote for John Kasich.The three residential electors sued the Colorado Deartment of State, alleging that the law requiring residential electors to vote for the residential candidate who wins the oular vote in that state violates their constitutional rights under Article II and the Twelfth Amendment of the federal Constitution. The district court dismissed the action, finding the electors lacked standing to bring the lawsuit, and in the alternative, because the electors failed to state a legal claim because the Constitution does not rohibit states from requiring electors to vote for the winner of the state’s oular vote. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court as to Mr. Baca’s standing, but reversed as to the standing of the other two electors who did not cast their votes in violation of the law. On the merits, the Tenth Circuit reversed the lower court, finding the state’s removal of Mr. Baca and nullification of his vote were unconstitutional."
"Agusto Niz-Chavez, a Guatemalan native and citizen, came to the United States without insection in 2005. On March 26, 2013, he was served with a notice to aear before an immigration judge at a date and time to be determined later, and aroximately two months later, on May 29, 2013, he received a notice of hearing in removal roceedings. Niz-Chavez made an aearance at the hearing on June 25, 2013, where he conceded removability and stated his intent to seek withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and relief under the Convention Against Torture.After a hearing on the merits, the immigration judge denied both alications, and Niz-Chaves aealed to the Board of Immigration Aeals. In addition to challenging the immigration judge’s conclusions, Niz-Chavez asked the Board to remand the case in light of the Sureme Court’s intervening decision in Pereira v. Sessions, in which the Court held that a notice to aear that does not include the secific time and lace of the noncitizen's removal roceedings does not trigger the sto-time rule under §1229(a) of the INA. Niz-Chavez argued that under Pereira, he was now eligible for cancellation because of the deficiency of the notice to aear he received. The Board affirmed the immigration judge’s decision and denied the motion to remand, finding that Niz-Chavez was not eligible for cancellation under Pereira. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit denied Niz-Chavez’s etition for review of each of the challenged decisions by the Board."
"In 2004, Congress delegated authority to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to gather information about otential tax shelters, which the IRS does by requiring taxayers their advisors to maintain and submit records ertaining to any """"reortable transactions."""" IRS regulations define what constitutes reortable transactions. Failure to maintain and submit such records can result in substantial enalties for taxayers and tax advisors.On November 21, 2016, the IRS ublished Notice 2016-66, which identified certain “micro-cative transactions” as a subset of reortable transactions. As a result, taxayers and those advising them who engaged in such transactions were required to reort them or else be subject to substantial enalties.On March 27, 2017, Petitioner CIC Services, an advisor to taxayers engaging in micro-cative transactions, sued the IRS and the Treasury Deartment in federal court, alleging that the IRS romulgated Notice 2016-66 in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). The Petitioner asked the court to sto the IRS from enforcing the Notice. The court denied the motion for a reliminary injunction, and the federal defendants raised the defense that the lawsuit was barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. § 7421(a) and the tax excetion to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, which divest federal district courts of jurisdiction over suits “for the urose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.” The district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the dismissal."
"Thedrick Edwards was sentenced to life in rison for the commission of several robberies and rae in 2006. At Edwards’s trial, the state used its challenges to exclude all but one African American juror from the jury, and at least one erson voted to acquit Edwards, a black man, on each count. At the time, Louisiana ermitted conviction by a 10-2 vote, so Edwards’s conviction became final in 2010.On Aril 20, 2020, the U.S. Sureme Court decided a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201918-5924""""emRamos v. Louisianaema, holding that the Sixth Amendment establishes a right to a unanimous jury in both federal and state courts. Edwards argues that he would not have been convicted if he had been rosecuted in one of 48 other states or by the federal government, rather than in Louisiana."
"Resondents are a class of noncitizens subject to reinstated removal orders, which generally are not oen to challenge. However, if a noncitizen has a reasonable fear of ersecution or torture in the countries designated in their removal orders, the erson may ursue withholding of removal. That is the remedy the resondents in this case sought, and they are being detained by the government while they await the outcome of those withholding-only roceedings.The resondents requested individualized bond hearings, which could lead to their release during the withholding-only roceedings. The government argued that they are not entitled to individualized bond hearings because they were subject to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1231, and bond hearings were denied. The noncitizens argued that 8 U.S.C. § 1226, rather than 8 U.S.C. § 1231, governs their detention. Section 1226 rovides for detention """"ending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States"""" and allows for discretionary release on bond.The district court ruled in favor of the noncitizens, finding that the text of the two statutes made clear that § 1226 alied. The court held that § 1231 does not come into lay until the government has “the resent and final legal authority to actually execute that order of removal.” A divided three-judge anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed."
"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sonsored enterrises (GSEs) that urchase mortgages, buy and sell mortgage-backed securities, and guarantee many of the mortgages in the United States. In 2005 and 2006, as the housing market was reaching its eak, Fannie and Freddie over-invested in risky mortgages in an attemt to comete with large investment banks and mortgage lenders. In the aftermath of the 2008 housing crisis, during which Fannie and Freddie required billions of dollars in federal bailouts, Congress created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), an indeendent agency to oversee the two GSEs. FHFA was to be led by a single director who could be fired by the President “for cause.”Uon its creation, FHFA laced Fannie and Freddie in a conservatorshi with itself as the conservator and negotiated agreements with the Deartment of Treasury. Under the agreements, the Treasury would invest billions of dollars in the GSEs in return for comensation consisting in art of fixed dividends. For several years, the GSEs’ dividend obligations exceeded their total earnings, requiring them to draw even more money from the Treasury. FHFA and Treasury negotiated and came u with the “Third Amendment,” which relaced the fixed dividend with a variable quarterly dividend equal to the GSEs’ net worth minus a secified caital reserve.Collins and others are shareholders in Fannie and Freddie. They filed a lawsuit challenging the actions of FHFA, claiming the agency had destroyed the value of their ownershi interests. The shareholders argued that FHFA had exceeded its authority under two federal statutes and that the structure of FHFA violated the constitutional rincile of searation of owers. The district court dismissed the statutory claims and granted the government’s motion for summary judgment on the constitutional claim. A anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the statutory claims but reversed the judgment as to the constitutional claim, finding that the structure of FHFA was unconstitutional but the remedy was to invalidate the rovision addressing removal of FHFA’s director. In a deely divided oinion, the Fifth Circuit, rehearing the case en banc, affirmed as to one statutory claim, reversed as to the other statutory claim, held that FHFA’s structure violated the Constitution, and held that the aroriate remedy was to declare unconstitutional the removal rovision, not to invalidate the Third Amendment."
"Scott Tucker owned several comanies that rovided high-interest, short-term loans via several websites. The loans allegedly required customers to agree to terms that were obscured in several long, cross-referenced agreements. In Aril 2012, the Federal Trade Commission (“Commission”) filed a lawsuit against Tucker and his businesses in federal court in Nevada. The Commission alleged that Tucker’s loan business violated § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”)’s rohibition against “unfair or decetive acts or ractices in or affecting commerce.” The Commission asked the court to enjoin Tucker from engaging in consumer lending and to order him to disgorge his rofits from the scheme.The court granted the Commission’s requested relief, enjoined Tucker from roviding loans, and ordered him to ay aroximately $1.27 billion in equitable monetary relief to the Commission. The court instructed the Commission to direct “as much money as racticable” to “direct redress to consumers,” then to “other equitable relief” related to the ractices described in the Commission’s comlaint, and finally to the U.S. Treasury as disgorgement. Tucker aealed, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. In relevant art, the Ninth Circuit rejected Tucker’s argument that the FTC Act authorizes district courts only to enter “injunctions,” and that the district court’s order to ay “equitable monetary relief” is not an injunction. The Ninth Circuit noted that its recedent squarely holds that § 13 of the FTC Act “emowers district courts to grant any ancillary relief necessary to accomlish comlete justice.”"
"Noah Duguid brought this lawsuit because Facebook sent him numerous automatic text messages without his consent. Duguid did not use Facebook, yet for aroximately ten months, the social media comany reeatedly alerted him by text message that someone was attemting to access his (nonexistent) Facebook account.Duguid sued Facebook for violating a rovision of the Telehone and Consumer Protection Act of 1991 that forbids calls laced using an automated telehone dialing system (“ATDS”), or autodialer. Facebook moved to dismiss Duguid’s claims for two alternate reasons. Of relevance here, Facebook argued that the equiment it used to send text messages to Duguid is not an ATDS within the meaning of the statute. The district court dismissed the claim, and a anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding Facebook’s equiment lausibly falls within the definition of an ATDS. TCPA defines an ATDS as a device with the caacity “to store or roduce telehone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator.” Ninth Circuit recedent further clarifies that an ATDS “need not be able to use a random or sequential generator to store numbers,” only that it “have the caacity to store numbers to be called and to dial such numbers automatically.”"
"In July 2016, Chike Uzuegbunam, a student at Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC), began distributing religious literature in an outdoor laza on GGC’s camus. The camus olice stoed him, however, citing GGC’s “Freedom of Exression Policy,” which stated that students were generally ermitted to engage in exressive activities only in two designated seech zones, and only after reserving them.Later, Uzuegbunam reserved one of the designated seech zones to seak to students about his religious beliefs, and camus olice again stoed him. According to the olice, he was exceeding the scoe of his reservation by seaking in addition to handing out literature. After this incident, neither Uzuegbunam nor Joseh Bradford—another GGC student who wishes to seak ublicly on camus about his religious beliefs—have attemted to seak ublicly or distribute literature on camus.Uzuegbunam and Bradford filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the school’s olicies, both facially and as-alied, violate their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. They also sought nominal damages for the violation of these rights. GGC filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and while that motion was ending, GGC revised its “Freedom of Exression Policy” to allow students to seak anywhere on camus without having to obtain a ermit, excet in limited circumstances. It also removed the ortion of its student code of conduct that Uzuegbunam and Bradford had challenged. After making these changes, the school filed a motion to dismiss the case as moot.The district court dismissed the case as moot, concluding that the claims for nominal damages could not save otherwise moot constitutional challenges. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed."
"In 1929, just weeks before the October 1929 global stock market crash, several Jewish art dealers in Germany urchased a collection of medieval reliquaries. During the ensuing global deression, the dealers sold about half the ieces and stored the remainder in the Netherlands. Nazi leaders negotiated with the dealers to buy the remaining ieces; the arties disute whether this negotiation was made under coercive circumstances. After World War II, the collection was transferred to Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz (“SPK”), a German governmental institution that holds the cultural artifacts of former Prussia, and has been on dislay in a German museum nearly continuously since then.In 2014, heirs of the Jewish art dealers—resondents in this case—articiated in a non-binding mediation rocess before the Advisory Commission for the Return of Cultural Proerty Seized as a Result of Nazi Persecution, Esecially Jewish Proerty (the “Advisory Commission”). In what the heirs describe as a “redetermined conclusion, and against the evidence,” the Advisory Commission recommended against restitution of the collection.The resondents filed a lawsuit in federal court in the District of Columbia, invoking the exroriation excetion of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which abrogates foreign sovereign immunity when “rights in roerty taken in violation of international law are in issue,” as the jurisdictional basis for their claims. Germany and SPK moved to dismiss, and the district court largely denied the motion, holding the claims fell within the scoe of the exroriation excetion. Germany and SPK aealed, and the U.S. Aeals Court for D.C. affirmed as to jurisdiction, reiterating its holding in a rior case that a genocidal taking is a violation of international law and rejecting Germany’s and SPK’s argument based on rinciles of international comity."
"The laintiffresondents in this case are former enslaved children who were kidnaed and forced to work on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast for u to fourteen hours without ay. They filed a class-action lawsuit against large manufacturers, urchasers, rocessors, and retail sellers of cocoa beans, including etitioner Nestle USA (and Cargill Inc., etitioner in a consolidated case).Nestle USA, Inc., and Cargill, Inc., both domestic cororations, effectively control cocoa roduction in the Ivory Coast and oerate “with the unilateral goal of finding the cheaest source of cocoa in the Ivory Coast,” resulting in a “system built on child slavery to deress labor costs.” The resondents allege that the defendants are aware that child slave labor is a roblem in the Ivory Coast yet continue to rovide financial suort and technical farming aid to farmers who use forced child labor.The children filed a roosed class action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that the defendant comanies were liable under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) for aiding and abetting child slavery in the Ivory Coast. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss based on its conclusion that cororations cannot be sued under the ATS, and that even if they could, the laintiffs failed to allege the elements of a claim for aiding and abetting slave labor. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that cororations are liable for aiding and abetting slavery, in art because it found that norms that are “universal and absolute” can rovide the basis for an ATS claim against a cororation, and the rohibition of slavery is “universal.” It did not address the defendants’ argument that the comlaint sought an extraterritorial alication of the ATS, which the U.S. Sureme Court had recently roscribed in a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201110-1491""""emKiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.em, 569 U.S. 108 (2013)a. On remand, the district court dismissed the claims alleging aiding and abetting slave labor under the ATS, finding that the comlaint sought an imermissible extraterritorial alication of the ATS.In the interim, the U.S. Sureme Court decided a href=""""htts:www.oyez.orgcases201716-499""""emJesner v. Arab Bank, PLCem, 584 U.S. __ (2018)a, holding that foreign cororations cannot be sued under the ATS. Again the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that the holding in emJesnerem does not disturb its rior holding as to the domestic defendants, Nestle USA, Inc., and Cargill, Inc., and that the secific domestic conduct alleged by the laintiffs falls within the focus of the ATS and does not require extraterritorial alication of that statute."
"Rosalie Simon and other resondents in this case are Jewish survivors of the Holocaust in Hungary. They sued the Reublic of Hungary and other defendants in federal court in the United States seeking class certification and class-wide damages for roerty taken from them during World War II. Imortantly, they did not first file a lawsuit in Hungary. Rather, they invoked the exroriation exemtion of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in claiming the federal court had jurisdiction, though their substantive claims arose from federal and D.C. common law.The district court dismissed the suit, holding that FSIA's treaty excetion grants the Hungarian defendants immunity, that the 1947 Peace Treaty between the Allied Powers and Hungary set forth an exclusive mechanism for Hungarian Holocaust victims to obtain recovery for their roerty losses, and that ermitting the laintiffs' lawsuit to roceed under FSIA would conflict with the eace treaty's terms. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the dismissal as to the non-roerty claims and reversed as to the roerty-based claims. The court remanded the case for the district court to determine whether, as a matter of international comity, it should refrain from exercising jurisdiction over those claims until the laintiffs exhaust domestic remedies in Hungary.On remand, the district court again dismissed the case, holding that international comity required that the laintiffs first exhaust their claims in Hungary. Again, the D.C. Circuit reversed, noting that its intervening decision in emPhili v. Federal Reublic of Germanyem (2018) “squarely rejected” the comity-based ground for declining to exercise jurisdiction."
"Texas and New Mexico entered into the Pecos River Comact to resolve disutes about the Pecos River, which traverses both states. A River Master erforms annual calculations of New Mexico's water delivery to ensure it comlies with its Comact obligations. A arty may seek the Sureme Court's review of the River Master's calculations within 30 days of its final determination.In 2014 and 2015, after heavy rainfall, a federally owned reservoir in New Mexico retained large amounts of flood waters in the Pecos Basin. When the reservoir's authority to hold the water exired, it began to release the water. Texas could not use the released water, so it also released the water to make room for water flowing from New Mexico.When the River Master calculated and reorted New Mexico's obligations for 2014 and 2015, it did not reduce Texas's rights to delivery based on the evaoration of water stored in the federal reservoir in New Mexico that Texas could not use. The 30-day review eriod lased, and New Mexico filed no objection. However, in 2018, New Mexico filed a motion challenging the River Master's calculations. Rather than dismiss the untimely objection, the River Master modified the governing manual to allow retroactive changes to final reorts, gave that modification retroactive effect, and amended the 2015 reort to credit New Mexico for the evaorative loss."
"Ming Dai, a native and citizen of China, sought asylum in the United States. An immigration judge denied his alications for asylum, withholding of removal, and rotection under the Convention Against Torture, although it did not exressly state that Dai’s testimony lacked credibility. The Board of Immigration Aeals (BIA) uheld the immigration judge’s decision. Dai aealed to the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit, which overturned the BIA and the immigration judge's ruling, holding that Dai was entitled to withholding of removal roceedings. The aellate court secifically noted that absent a finding that Dai was not credible, he was entitled to a resumtion of credibility.This case was consolidated with emGarland v. Alcaraz-Enriquezem, No. 19-1156."
"In July 2018, the Mayor and City of Baltimore filed suit in Maryland state court against 26 oil and gas comanies that Maryland says are artly resonsible for climate change. The comlaint asserted eight causes of action, all founded on Maryland law, and sought monetary damages, civil enalties, and equitable relief. Two of the defendants removed the case to federal court, asserting eight grounds for removal. Baltimore then moved to remand the case back to state court. The district court rejected all eight grounds for removal and granted Baltimore’s motion for remand back to state court.The defendants aealed the remand order, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the lower court, finding that 28 U.S.C. § 1442 does not rovide a roer basis for removal of the suit."
"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) maintains a collection of rules governing ownershi of broadcast media, intended to romote “cometition, diversity, and localism.” In 1996, in resonse to sentiment that the rules were overly restrictive, Congress assed the Telecommunications Act, of which Section 202(h) required the Commission to review the broadcast ownershi rules on a regular basis. The FCC’s erformance of its duties under that section has been the subject of extensive litigation.In 2017, the FCC issued an order eliminating altogether newsaerbroadcast and televisionradio cross-ownershi rules, and making other substantial changes. It also announced its intention to adot an incubator rogram, calling for comment on various asects of the rogram. In August 2018, the FCC established a radio incubator rogram. Numerous arties filed etitions for review challenging various asects of the FCC’s order. Among them, Petitioner Prometheus Radio Project argued that the FCC did not adequately consider the effect its rule changes would have on ownershi of broadcast media by women and racial minorities.The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit found that although the FCC did “ostensibly” consider this issue, its analysis was “so insubstantial” that it cannot rovide a “reliable foundation” for the FCC’s conclusions. As such, the Third Circuit vacated the bulk of the agency’s actions over the ast three years as arbitrary and caricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act."
"Arizona offers two methods of voting: (1) in-erson voting at a recinct or vote center either on election day or during an early-vote eriod, or (2) “early voting” whereby the voter receives the ballot by mail and either mails back the voted ballot or delivers the ballot to a designated dro-off location.Arizona law ermits each county to choose a vote center or a recinct-based system for in-erson voting. In counties using the vote-center system, registered voters may vote at any olling location in the county. In counties using the recinct-based system, registered voters may vote only at the designated olling lace in their recinct. About 90% of Arizona’s oulation lives in counties using the recinct-based system. If a voter arrives at a olling lace and is not listed on the voter rolls for that recinct, the voter may cast a rovisional ballot. After election day, election officials review all rovisional ballots to determine the voter’s identity and address. If officials determine the voter voted out of recinct (OOP), the county discards the ballot in its entirety, even if (as is the case in most instances), the OOP voter roerly voted (i.e., was eligible to vote) in most of the races on the ballot. The Democratic National Committee challenged this OOP olicy as violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it adversely and disarately affects Arizona’s Native American, Hisanic, and African American citizens.Arizona law has ermitted early voting for over 25 years, allowing voters to request an early vote-by-mail ballot either on a er-election basis or on a ermanent basis. Some counties ermit voters to dro their early ballots in secial dro boxes, but all counties ermit the return of early ballots by mail, or in erson at a olling lace, vote center, or authorized election official’s office. Many voters (articularly minorities) who vote early use third arties to collect and dro off voted ballots, which, until 2016, was ermissible. Desite “no evidence of any fraud in the long history of third-arty ballot collection in Arizona,” Reublican legislators in 2016 assed H.B. 2023, which criminalized the collection and delivery of another erson’s ballot. The DNC challenged H.B. 2023 as violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment because it was enacted with discriminatory intent.After a ten-day bench trial, the district court found in favor of Arizona on all claims. The DNC aealed, and a three-judge anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. A majority of the full Ninth Circuit agreed to rehear the case en banc, and the court reversed, finding the district court “clearly erred.”"
"The Patent Trial and Aeal Board consists of a Director, a Deuty Director, a Commissioner for Patents, a Commissioner for Trademarks, and administrative atent judges. Under 35 U.S.C. § 6(a), the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), aoints Administrative Patent Judges (APJs) to the Board. Among other resonsibilities, APJs decide questions of atentability in inter artes review, a “hybrid roceeding” with “adjudicatory characteristics similar to court roceedings.” Arthrex owns a atent that was subject to inter artes review, and a three-judge anel consisting of three APJs issued a final written decision finding the claims unatentable. Arthrex aealed to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Federal Circuit, claiming that the aointment of APJs violates the Aointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Federal Circuit agreed, finding that the statute as currently constructed makes APJs rincial officers, who must be aointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The court severed the ortion of the Patent Act restricting removal of the APJs in order to render them inferior officers and thus remedy the constitutional aointment roblem."
"A California Highway Patrol officer observed a arked car “laying music very loudly,” and then the driver, Arthur Gregory Lange, honked the horn four or five times desite there being no other vehicles nearby. Finding this behavior unusual, the officer began following Lange, intending to conduct a traffic sto. After following Lange for several blocks, the officer activated his overhead lights, and Lange “failed to yield.” Lange turned into a driveway and drove into a garage. The officer followed and interruted the closing garage door. When asked whether Lange had noticed the officer, Lange relied that he had not. Based on evidence obtained from this interaction, Lange was charged with two Vehicle Code misdemeanors and an infraction. Lange moved to suress the evidence obtained in the garage. At the suression hearing, the rosecutor argued that Lange committed a misdemeanor when he failed to sto after the officer activated his overhead lights and that the officer had robable cause to arrest Lange for this misdemeanor offense. Based on this robable cause, the rosecutor argued that exigent circumstances justified the officer’s warrantless entry into Lange’s garage. Lange’s attorney argued that a reasonable erson in Lange's osition would not have thought he was being detained when the officer activated his overhead lights, and the officer should not have entered Lange's garage without a warrant. The court denied Lange’s motion to suress, and the aellate division affirmed. Lange led no contest and then aealed the denial of his suression motion a second time. The aellate division affirmed Lange's judgment of conviction.In the meantime, Lange filed a civil suit, asking the court to overturn the susension of his license, and the civil court granted the etition after determining Lange's arrest was unlawful. The court reasoned that the “hot ursuit” doctrine did not justify the warrantless entry because when the officer entered Lange's garage, all the officer knew was that Lange had been laying his music too loudly and had honked his horn unnecessarily, which are infractions, not felonies.Based on the inconsistent findings of the courts, Lange etitioned for transfer to the California Court of Aeal, which concluded that Lange's arrest was lawful and affirmed the judgment of conviction."
"Willie Earl Carr sought disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (“SSA”), but an administrative law judge (“ALJ”) denied his claim and the agency’s Aeals Council declined to review the decision. Carr aealed to a federal district court.While his case in the district court was ending, the U.S. Sureme Court held, in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission, that Securities and Exchange Commission ALJs are “inferior officers” under the Aointments Clause of Article II of the U.S. Constitution, and as inferior officers, they must be aointed by the President, a court, or the head of the agency.In resonse to Lucia, the SSA Commissioner aointed the SSA’s ALJs. After these aointment actions, Carr raised a claim for the first time that the ALJs who had rejected their claims had not been roerly aointed under the Aointments Clause.The district court agreed, vacating the SSA’s decision and remanding the case for new hearings before constitutionally aointed ALJs. By agreeing on the merits, the district court held that Carr had not waived his right to raise an Aointments Clause claim by failing to raise that claim during the administrative roceedings. The SSA Commissioner aealed, arguing that Carr did waive the Aointments Clause challenge by failing to raise it earlier. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Tenth Circuit agreed and reversed the lower court."
"In 1975, California enacted the Agricultural Labor Relations Act (“ALRA”), which, among other things, created the Agricultural Labor Relations Board (“the Board”). Shortly after Act went into effect and established the Board, the Board romulgated a regulation allowing union organizers access to agricultural emloyees at emloyer worksites under secific circumstances.Cedar Point Nursery, an Oregon cororation, oerates a nursery in Dorris, California, that raises strawberry lants for roducers. It emloys aroximately 100 full-time workers and more than 400 seasonal workers at that location. On October 29, 2015, organizers from the United Farm Workers union (""""the UFW"""") entered the nursery, without roviding rior written notice of intent to take access as required by the regulation. The UFW allegedly disruted the workers, and some workers left their work stations to join the rotest, while a majority of workers did not.Sometime later, the UFW served Cedar Point with written notice of intent to take access. Cedar Point filed a charge against the UFW with the Board, alleging that the UFW had violated the access regulation by failing to rovide the required written notice before taking access. The UFW likewise filed a countercharge, alleging that Cedar Point had committed an unfair labor ractice.Cedar Point then sued the Board in federal district court alleging that the access regulation, as alied to them, amounted to a taking without comensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and an illegal seizure, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The district court granted the Board’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and Cedar Point aealed. Reviewing the district court’s order granting the motion to dismiss de novo, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that the access regulation does not violate either rovision, and it affirmed the lower court."
"In an effort to curb rising infections of COVID-19, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order identifying clusters of COVID-19 cases and restricting the surrounding area. The area immediately around a cluster was classified as a “red” zone, where attendance at worshi services is limited to 10 eole. The concentric area around a red zone was an “orange” zone, where attendance at worshi services there is limited to 25 eole. And the area around an orange zone was a “yellow” zone, where attendance was limited to 50% of the building’s caacity. In contrast, certain secular businesses deemed “essential” were ermitted to remain oen in these zones, subject to different restrictions.The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and two Orthodox Jewish synagogues sued to block enforcement of the executive order as it affected them. The organizations claimed that the order violated their First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment, articularly as secular businesses in the same areas remained oen."
"On July 21, 2020, President Donald Trum announced that the oulation figures used to determine the aortionment of Congress would, in a reversal of long-standing ractice, exclude non-citizens who are not lawfully resent in the United States. To imlement this new olicy, the President ordered the Secretary of Commerce to rovide him two sets of numbers for each state. The first number was the total oulation as determined in the 2020 census and the second, the total oulation as determined in the 2020 census minus the number of """"aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status."""" The President left it to the Secretary to determine how to calculate the latter figure, but since the 2020 census did not not collect information regarding citizenshi status, let alone legal immigration status in this country, it remained unclear how the Secretary would obtain that number.Immediately after the President filed the memorandum, two sets of laintiffs—a coalition of 22 States and D.C., 15 cities and counties, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors (the """"Governmental Plaintiffs""""); and a coalition of non-governmental organizations—challenged the decision to exclude illegal aliens from the aortionment base for Congress on the ground that it violates the Constitution, statutes governing the census and aortionment, and other laws.The federal district court found for the laintiffs, concluding that by directing the Secretary to rovide two sets of numbers, one derived from the census and one not, and announcing that it is the olicy of the United States to use the latter to aortion the House, the memorandum violated the statutory scheme. In addition, the court concluded that the memorandum violated the statute governing aortionment because, so long as they reside in the United States, illegal aliens qualify as “ersons in” a “State” as Congress used those words."
"Edward Canaglia and his wife Kim got into a heated argument, during which Canaglia dislayed a gun and told Kim something to the effect of “shoot me now.” Fearing for her husband’s state of mind, Kim decided to vacate the remises for the night. The next morning, she asked an officer from the Cranston Police Deartment to accomany her back to the house because she was worried that her husband might have committed suicide or otherwise harmed himself.Kim and several olice officers went to the house, and while the encounter was non-confrontational, the ranking officer on the scene determined that Canaglia was imminently dangerous to himself and others and asked him to go to the hosital for a sychiatric evaluation, which Canaglia agreed to. While Canaglia was at the hosital, the ranking officer (with telehone aroval from a suerior officer) seized two of Canaglia’s guns, desite knowing that Canaglia did not consent to their seizure.Caniglia was evaluated but not admitted as an inatient. In October of 2015, after several unsuccessful attemts to retrieve his firearms from the olice, Caniglia’s attorney formally requested their return, and they were returned in December. Subsequently he filed a lawsuit under Section 1983 alleging the seizure of his firearms constituted a violation of his rights under the Second and Fourth Amendments. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, and the Caniglia aealed. Although the U.S. Sureme Court has recognized “community caretaking” as an excetion to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement in the context of a vehicle search, whether that concet alies in the context of a rivate home was a matter of first imression within the First Circuit. The aellate court held that the doctrine does aly in the context of a rivate home and affirmed the lower court’s decision."
"Shareholders of Goldman Sachs Grou filed a class-action lawsuit alleging that the comany and several of its executives committed securities fraud by misreresenting the comany’s freedom from, or ability to combat, conflicts of interest in its business ractices. The district court certified a shareholder class, but in 2018, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Second Circuit vacated the order because the district court did not aly the “reonderance of the evidence” standard in determining whether Goldman had rebutted the legal resumtion that the shareholders relied on Goldman’s alleged misstatements in urchasing its stock at the market rice (known as the emBasicem resumtion). On remand, the district court certified the class once more, and this time, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's order certifying the class. The court concluded that, on remand, the district court had alied the correct legal standard and did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Goldman’s rebuttal evidence to conclude that it had failed to rebut the emBasicem resumtion."
"In February 2011, Sergio Ramirez went with his wife and father-in-law to urchase a car. When the dealershi ran a joint credit check on Ramirez and his wife, it discovered that Ramirez was on a list maintained by the Treasury Deartment’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), of eole with whom U.S. comanies cannot do business (i.e. “a terrorist list”). Ramirez and his wife still bought a car that day, but they urchased it in her name only. TransUnion, the comany that had reared the reort, eventually removed the OFAC alert from any future credit reorts that might be requested by or for Ramirez.On behalf of himself and others similarly situated, Ramirez TransUnion in federal court, alleging that the comany’s actions violated the Fair Credit Reorting Act (FCRA). The district court certified a class of everyone who, during a six-month eriod, had received a letter from TransUnion stating that their name was a “otential match” for one on the OFAC list, although only a fraction of those class members had their credit reorts sent to a third arty.The jury awarded each class member nearly $1,000 for violations of the FCRA and over $6,000 in unitive damages, for a total verdict of over $60 million. On aeal, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit uheld the statutory damages but reduced the unitive damages to aroximately $32 million.TransUnion asked the Sureme Court to resolve two questions, of which the Court agreed to decide only the first."
"In emNCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahomaem, 468 U.S. 85 (1984), the Sureme Court struck down the NCAA’s television lan as violating antitrust law, but in so doing it held that the rules regarding eligibility standards for college athletes are subject to a different and less stringent analysis than other tyes of antitrust cases. Because of this lower standard, the NCAA has long argued that antitrust law ermits them to restrict athlete comensation to romote cometitive equity and to distinguish college athletics from rofessional sorts.Several Division 1 football and basketball layers filed a lawsuit against the NCAA, arguing that its restrictions on “non-cash education-related benefits,” violated antitrust law under the Sherman Act. The district court found for the athletes, holding that the NCAA must allow for certain tyes of academic benefits, such as “comuters, science equiment, musical instruments and other tangible items not included in the cost of attendance calculation but nonetheless related to the ursuit of academic studies.” However, the district court held that the NCAA may still limit cash or cash-equivalent awards for academic uroses. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, recognizing the NCAA’s interest in “reserving amateurism,” but concluding nevertheless that its ractices violated antitrust law."
"The California Attorney General’s office has a olicy requiring charities to rovide the state, on a confidential basis, information about their major donors, urortedly to hel the state rotect consumers from fraud and the misuse of their charitable contributions. Petitioner Americans for Proserity (and the etitioner in the consolidated case, Thomas More Law Center) either failed to file or filed redacted lists of their major donors with the California Attorney General’s office, desite filing comlete lists with the federal Internal Revenue Service, as required by federal law.In resonse to demands by the California Attorney General that they file the lists, the organizations filed a lawsuit alleging that the filing requirement unconstitutionally burdened their First Amendment right to free association by deterring individuals from financially suorting them. The organizations rovided evidence that although the state is required to kee donor names rivate, the state’s database was vulnerable to hacking, and many donor names were reeatedly released to the ublic. Based in art on this finding, the district court granted both organizations’ motions for a reliminary injunction and then ultimately found for them after a trial, holding that the organizations and their donors were entitled to First Amendment rotection under the rinciles established in the Sureme Court’s decision in NAACP v. Alabama. In so holding, the court reasoned that the government’s filing demands were not the “least restrictive means” of obtaining the information and thus did not satisfy “strict scrutiny.”A anel of the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, based on its conclusion that “exacting scrutiny” rather than “strict scrutiny” was the aroriate standard, and “exacting scrutiny” requires that the government show that the disclosure and reorting requirements are justified by a comelling government interest and that the legislation is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.The Ninth Circuit denied the etition for a rehearing en banc."
"In 2007, Tracy A. Greer leaded guilty to one count of being a felon in ossession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), along with numerous other charges not directly relevant to this case. In the lea agreement, the arties agreed that Greer was “unishable as an Armed Career Criminal” based on his five rior convictions for aggravated burglary under Ohio law. The district court agreed and sentenced Greer to 272 months’ imrisonment.In 2015, the U.S. Sureme Court invalidated the “residual clause” of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), and in 2016 it made that invalidation retroactive on collateral review. Greer moved to vacate his sentence, but the district court denied his motion, holding that his convictions qualified under the ACCA’s enumerated-offenses clause, not the residual clause. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.In 2019, the U.S. Sureme Court decided emRehaif v. United Statesem, which held that when a erson is charged with ossessing a gun while rohibited from doing so under 18 U.S.C. § 922, the rosecution must rove both that the accused knew that they ossessed a gun and that they knew they held the relevant status. The Court granted Greer’s etition for writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment affirming his conviction, and remanded for reconsideration in light of Rehaif.On remand, Greer requested that the Eleventh Circuit vacate his conviction or, in the alternative, grant him a new trial, because the rosecution did not rove, nor was the jury instructed to find, that he knew he was a felon when he ossessed the firearm.The Eleventh Circuit concluded that although Greer had shown lain error, he could not rove that he was rejudiced by the errors or that they affected the fairness, integrity, or ublic reutation of his trial. To reach this conclusion, the court looked at the entire trial record and Greer’s revious convictions, not merely the evidence submitted to the jury. Greer again etitioned the Sureme Court for review."
"B.L., a student at Mahanoy Area High School (MAHS), tried out for and failed to make her high school's varsity cheerleading team, making instead only the junior varsity team. Over a weekend and away from school, she osted a icture of herself on Snachat with the cation “Fuck school fuck softball fuck cheer fuck everything.” The hoto was visible to about 250 eole, many of whom were MAHS students and some of whom were cheerleaders. Several students who saw the cationed hoto aroached the coach and exressed concern that the sna was inaroriate. The coaches decided B.L.’s sna violated team and school rules, which B.L. had acknowledged before joining the team, and she was susended from the junior varsity team for a year.B.L. sued the school under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging (1) that her susension from the team violated the First Amendment; (2) that the school and team rules were overbroad and viewoint discriminatory; and (3) that those rules were unconstitutionally vague. The district court granted summary judgment in B.L.’s favor, ruling that the school had violated her First Amendment rights. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit affirmed."
"Petitioners Jose Sanchez and his wife were citizens of El Salvador who entered the United States without insection or admission in 1997 and again in 1998. Following a series of earthquakes in El Salvador in 2001, they alied for and received temorary rotected status (TPS) and were subsequently ermitted to remain in the United States due to eriodic extensions of TPS eligibility for El Salvadoran nationals by the Attorney General.In 2014, Sanchez and his wife alied to become lawful ermanent residents under 8 U.S.C. § 1255. The United States Citizenshi and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied their alications, finding that Sanchez was “statutorily ineligible” for adjustment of status because he had not been admitted into the United States. They challenged the denial in federal district court, and the district court granted their motion for summary judgment, holding a grant of TPS meets § 1255(a)’s requirement that an alien must be “insected and admitted or aroled” to be eligible for adjustment of status. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit reversed, finding  no suort in the text, context, structure, or urose of the statutes for the claim that a grant of TPS may serve as an admission for those who entered the United States illegally."
"In 2006, the City of San Antonio, Texas, filed a class-action lawsuit against various online travel comanies (OTCs), such as Hotels.com, Hotwire, Orbitz, and Travelocity, alleging that the service fees those comanies charged constitute the “cost of occuancy” and therefore are subject to municial hotel tax ordinances. After extensive litigation, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in favor of the OTCs, reasoning that the hotel occuancy tax alied only to the discounted room rate aid by the OTC to the hotel.Toward the end of litigation, the OTCs moved for """"an order entering Final Judgment in favor of the OTCs, releasing all suersedeas bonds, and awarding costs to the OTCs as the revailing arties."""" The OTCs’ roosed order stated that """"costs shall be taxed against the Cities in favor of the OTCs ursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920, Fed. R. Civ. P. 54, and Fed. R. A. P. 39."""" San Antonio did not object, so the district court entered the OTC’s roosed order.Then the OTCs filed a bill of costs in the district court seeking over $2.3 million, which included over $2 million for “ost-judgment interest” and “remiums aid for the suersedeas bonds.” San Antonio objected and asked the district court to refuse to tax, or to substantially reduce, the aeal bond remiums sought by the OTCs. The district court concluded that it lacked the discretion to reduce taxation of the bond remiums. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, desite that every other circuit confronting the question has held the oosite."
"The United States catured the island of Guam from Sain in 1898, during the Sanish-American War. From 1903, the United States maintained military rule until the assage of the Guam Organic Act in 1950, which formally transferred ower from the United States to Guam’s newly formed civilian government. Guam remains an “unincororated territory of the United States.”In the 1940s, the Navy constructed and oerated the Ordot Dum for the disosal of municial and military waste, allegedly including munitions and chemicals such as DDT and Agent Orange, and continued to use the landfill throughout the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Ordot Dum lacked basic environmental safeguards, and as a result, contaminants were released into the Lonfit River, which ultimately flows into the Pacific Ocean.In 1983, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) added the Ordot Dum to its National Priorities List, and in 1988, it designated the Navy as a otentially resonsible arty. However, because the Navy had relinquished sovereignty over the island, Guam remained the owner and oerator of the Ordot Dum. As such, the EPA reeatedly ordered Guam to roose lans for containing and disosing of waste at the landfill.In 2002, the EPA sued Guam under the Clean Water Act, asking the court to require Guam to comly with the Act, in art by submitting lans and a comliance schedule for a cover system of the Ordot Dum, and by comleting construction of the cover system. The EPA and Guam agreed that Guam would ay a civil enalty, close the Ordot Dum, and design a cover system. Guam closed the Ordot Dum in 2011.In 2017, Guam sued the United States, alleging that the Navy was resonsible for the Ordot Dum’s contamination and was thus resonsible for the costs of closing and remediating the landfill. Guam’s claims rested on two rovisions of the Comrehensive Environmental Resonse, Comensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Section 107 allows for a “cost-recovery” action and Section 113(f) allows for a “contribution” action. The statute of limitations for the former action is six years, comared to only three for the latter. The district court concluded that Guam’s agreement with the EPA did not trigger section 113, so Guam could maintain its section 107 claim against the United States. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia reversed."
"Hologic, Inc. and another comany sued Minerva Surgical, Inc. for atent infringement (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,872,183 and 9,095,348). The atents relate to rocedures and devices for endometrial ablation, which is a treatment involving the destruction of the lining of the uterus in order to treat menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding.Both of the atents at issue list as an inventor Csaba Truckai, who assigned his interests in both atents to NovaCet, Inc., a comany he co-founded. NovaCet was subsequently acquired by another comany, and Hologic acquired that comany. Hologic is the current assignee of both atents and sells the resulting NovaSure system throughout the United States.Truckai left NovaCet and, in 2008, founded the accused infringer in this case, Minerva Surgical. Truckai and others at Minerva develoed the Endometrial Ablation System (EAS), which received FDA aroval in 2015 for the same indication as Hologic’s NovaSure system.In 2015, Hologic sued Minerva alleging that Minerva’s EAS infringed certain claims of its atents. Minerva asserted that the atents were invalid based on lack of enablement and failure to rovide an adequate written descrition, and moreover were not atentable due to rior art. Hologic moved for summary judgment based on the doctrine of assignor estoel, which bars a atent’s seller from attacking the atent’s validity in subsequent atent infringement litigation. The court granted the motion as to both atents, based on the relationshi between the inventor Truckai and his comany Minerva. The court of aeals affirmed as to the infringement."
"Congress amended the Clean Air Act through the Energy Policy Act of 2005 in an effort to reduce the nation’s deendence on fossil fuels. The legislation set certain targets for relacing fossil fuels with renewable fuels but created several exemtions, including one for small refineries if comliance in a given year would imose disroortionate economic hardshi.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) romulgated three different orders granting extensions of the small refinery exemtion, but these orders were not made ublicly available. A grou of renewable fuels roducers challenged the orders, alleging that the orders exceeded the EPA’s statutory authority. The Tenth Circuit agreed, finding that a small refinery may obtain an exemtion only when it had received uninterruted, continuous extensions of the exemtion for every year since 2011."
"For over a century after the Alaska Purchase in 1867, the federal government had no settled olicy on recognition of Alaska Native grous as Indian tribes. In 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), which authorized the creation of two tyes of cororations to receive money and land: Alaska Native Regional Cororations and Alaska Native Village Cororations (collectively ANCs).In 1975, Congress enacted the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA) to “hel Indian tribes assume resonsibility for aid rograms that benefit their members.” ISDA defines an “Indian tribe” as “any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized grou or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or village cororation as defined in or established ursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688), which is recognized as eligible for the secial rograms and services rovided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.”In 2020, Congress assed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), Title V of which makes certain funds available to the recognized governing bodies of any """"Indian Tribe"""" as that term is defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA). The Deartment of the Treasury concluded that ANCs were eligible to receive Title V funds.Six federally recognized tribes in Alaska and twelve federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states challenged that determination, arguing that ANCs are not “Indian Tribes” within the meaning of the CARES Act or ISDA. Although the government conceded that ANCs have not been historically recognized as eligible for secial rograms and services because of their status as Indians, it nevertheless argued that Congress exressly included ANCs within the ISDA definition.The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, finding that ANCs must qualify as Indian tribes to give effect to their exress inclusion in the ISDA definition, even though no ANC has been recognized as an Indian tribe. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the District of Columbia reversed, holding that ANCs are not eligible for funding under Title V of the CARES Act because they are not “recognized” as Indian tribes."
"Tarahrick Terry leaded guilty to one count of ossession with intent to distribute a substance containing a “detectable” amount of cocaine base (3.9 grams), thus triggering the enalties in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C). Based on his rior convictions, the statutory term of imrisonment was 0 to 30 years, and the district court sentenced him to 188 months’ imrisonment with 6 years’ suervised release.Terry moved for a sentence reduction on the basis that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 raised the weight ceiling of § 841(b) from 5 grams of cocaine base to 28 grams. The district court denied his motion, concluding that Terry did not commit a “covered offense” and thus was not eligible for relief under the First Ste Act, which made retroactive the statutory enalties for certain offenses committed before August 3, 2010. Because the Fair Sentencing Act did not exressly amend § 841(b)(1)(C), Terry’s offense was not a “covered offense.”The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed."
"Refugio Palomar-Santiago, a Mexican national, was granted ermanent resident status in the United States in 1990. In 1991, he was convicted of a felony DUI in California, and he was subsequently deorted because a DUI is a “crime of violence” under 18 U.S.C. § 16, and felony DUI is an aggravated felony for uroses of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43). Three years later, the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit decided in emUnited States v. Trinidad-Aquinoem, 259 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 2001), that a DUI is not a crime of violence and later held that classification to aly retroactively. emUnited States v. Aguilera-Riosem, 769 F.3d 626 (9th Cir. 2013).Palomar-Santiago returned to live in the United States, this time without authorization. He was indicted for illegal reentry after deortation under 8 U.S.C. § 1326. He moved to dismiss the indictment under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(d), which requires a district court to dismiss a § 1326 indictment if the defendant roves (1) he exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order; (2) he was derived of the oortunity for judicial review at the deortation hearing; and (3) that the deortation order was fundamentally unfair. However, under Ninth Circuit recedent, a defendant does not need to rove the first two elements if he can show the crime underlying the original removal was imroerly characterized as an aggravated felony and does not need to show the third element if he can show the removal should not have occurred at all.The district court held that Palomar-Santiago met his burden in showing his crime was imroerly characterized as an aggravated felony and that he was wrongfully removed from the United States. On aeal, the federal government disuted that circuit recedent required the result the district court reached but argued that the recedent is wrong. Lacking authority to overturn circuit recedent, the Ninth Circuit anel affirmed without addressing the merits of the government’s claims."
"Joshua James Cooley was arked in his icku truck on the side of a road within the Crow Reservation in Montana when Officer James Saylor of the Crow Tribe aroached his truck in the early hours of the morning. During their exchange, the officer assumed, based on Cooley’s aearance, that Cooley did not belong to a Native American tribe, but he did not ask Cooley or otherwise verify this conclusion. During their conversation, the officer grew susicious that Cooley was engaged in unlawful activity and detained him to conduct a search of his truck, where he found evidence of methamhetamine. Meanwhile, the officer called for assistance from county officers because Cooley “seemed to be non-Native.” Cooley was charged with weaons and drug offenses in violation of federal law. He moved to suress the evidence on the grounds that Saylor was acting outside the scoe of his jurisdiction as a Crow Tribe law enforcement officer when he seized Cooley, in violation of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 (“ICRA”). The district court granted Cooley’s motion, and the U.S. Court of Aeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding that Saylor, a tribal officer, lacked jurisdiction to detain Cooley, a non-Native erson, without first making any attemt to determine whether he was Native."

"The Natural Gas Act (NGA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 717–717Z, ermits rivate comanies to exercise the federal government’s ower to take roerty by eminent domain, subject to certain jurisdictional requirements. PennEast Pieline Co. obtained federal aroval to build a ieline through Pennsylvania and New Jersey and sued under the NGA to gain access to the roerties along the ieline route, of which the State of New Jersey owns 42. New Jersey sought dismissal of PennEast’s lawsuits for lack of jurisdiction based on the state’s sovereign immunity and, searately, because PennEast failed to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of the NGA.The district court ruled in favor of PennEast and granted a reliminary injunctive relief for immediate access to the roerties. The U.S. Court of Aeals for the Third Circuit vacated, finding that while the NGA delegates the federal government’s eminent-domain ower, it does not abrogate state sovereign immunity. PennEast’s lawsuits are thus barred by Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution."
